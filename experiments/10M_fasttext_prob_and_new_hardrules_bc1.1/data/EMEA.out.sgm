<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the public service survey report (EPAR) in which describes how the Committee for Humanities (CHMP) presented the study carried out in order to reach recommendations regarding the application of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you require further information about your disease or their treatment, please read the package content (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacies.</seg>
<seg id="3">For further information on the basis of the recommendations of CHMP, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, less than 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets (tablets, which dissolve in mouth) as a solution to intake (1 mg / ml) and as injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. vertebres and speaking, Hallucinations (listening or vision of things which are not present), misery and madness; • bipolar disorder, a mental illness, in which the patients suffer from normal episodes of normal conditions.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abili is used for the treatment of moderate to severe severe episodes and preventive episodes on patients who have been addressed to the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">Injection solution is used for rapid control of disturbances or behavioural troubles if the oral intake of the medicine is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both cases, the solution can accept or use the melting tray for patients who prepares the swallowing of tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who use other medicines at the same time, the dose of aging should be adapted to the same time.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs the signal transmission between brain cells through "neurotransmitter" that are chemical substances which enable communication of the nerve cells to another.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripipetus probably acts as "partial agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called Serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripipraises such as 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in a lower degree than the neurotransmitter works in order to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Da Dopamine and 5-Hydroxytryptamin with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder plays a role which helps to normalize the activity of the brain, which prevents psychotic or lack of symptoms and its recovery is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of aggert, the recovery of symptoms, was examined in three trials over up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared to two studies at 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar illnesses caused by an undisturbanished intoxicity, compared to placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilling was conducted over twelve weeks in 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilia and placebo which have been performing recurring, in 160 patients, where the lack of symptoms have already been stabilized.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilion injection solution was reported in a study of 301 patient with bipolar disorder, who had suffered in disturbance suffering from Lorazepam (another antipsychototic) and placebo over a period of two hours compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies the change of symptoms were investigated using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">In addition, the company also led studies to examine how the body is taking the melting tray and solution for ingestion (up).</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with the injection solution, patients showed an increase in doses of 5.25 mg, 9,75 mg or 15 mg, significantly more power reduction in symptoms than the patients receiving a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the application of the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilion decreased in four of the five short-time studies deficiencies as placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilion prevented the more effective than placebo for up to 74 weeks in the previously treated patients and when in addition to an existing treatment was given.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilt injection injections in 10- or 15-mg doses has also decreased more effective than placebo and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common adverse events of Abillet (observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are extrapyramidated disorders (uncontrolled), headache, nausea (nausea), physical strength, nausea (nausea), tiredness, nausea level (increased saliva), fatigue and exhaustion, rowing damage, Insomnie (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The closure of the Committee for Humanities (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of agizophrenia and from moderate to severe mechanics in patients with bipolar-I disorder as well as in the prevention of a new manian episode in patients who had predominantly maneuvering the treatment with Aripipetus, compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the Committee came to the result that the advantages of injected unrest and behavioural troubles in patients with schizophrenia or patients with deficienceperiods of bipolar-I failure, if an oral therapy is not suitable, compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. issued an authorization for the market traffic in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is for the treatment of equal to severe episodes of bipolar disorder and prevention of a new manian episode in patients who had predominantly lack of episodes and their manic episodes on the treatment of Aripiprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once a day regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">A increased efficacy at doses above a daily dose of 15 mg was not detected, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once a day, regardless of meals as a monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years was not proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group a lower initial dose should be considered as clinical factors (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 induction is taken from the combination therapy, the arithmetic dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to mental illness and affection disorders and was reported in some cases after onset of antipsychotic therapy, also in treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder we showed no higher suicides risk with Aripipetus compared to other antipsychotica.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripipetus should be used with caution in patients with familiar kardiovasculine diseases (myocardial infectious diseases), cerebrovascular diseases (dehydration dehydration, Hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure sensitive drugs) or hypertension (including acute and maligne form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Spätdyskinesia: in clinical trials, which one year or less continued, there were occasional items about during the treatment with Aripipezole.</seg>
<seg id="39">If with ABILIFY treated patients receiving signs and symptoms of Spätdyskinesis, should be drawn into consideration, the dose should reduce or remove the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient is based on a mns, or unclear fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics, including ABILIFY, have to be placed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore, Aripiprazole should be applied in patients with cramporations in the incamnation or in stators that are applied with caution.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years old, with Aripipetrels in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripipetus, an increased risk of death in comparison to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there were in one of these studies, a study involving a fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for unwanted cereal events in treated with Aripienszole patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with Ketoaziam or hyperosmolarem coma, was reported in patients who were treated with atypical antipsychotic agents including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessment for hyperglycemia-related events with ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic drug patients who allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in terms of deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain of weight is generally observed in schizophrens patients and patients with bipolar manoeuvre, the application of antipsychotica, which is known as an additional effect on which weight gain as an additional effect and could lead to severe complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripipetus on the central nervous system is caution, if Aripipetus is in combination with alcohol or other centralized drugs with overlaid side effects such as Sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripipetus, but this effect is considered clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased the AUC of Aripipetus up 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as Fluoxetin and paroxetine, similar effects and therefore should be made similar doses.</seg>
<seg id="52">In CYP2D6 'bad' (= "Poor") Metabolism, the joint application with high-effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentration of Aripipetus results in comparison to CYP2D6 extensive metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you consider the common gift of Ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential benefits that weigh potential risks for the patients.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly efficient inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protector inhibitors, may have similar effects and therefore ought to be made similar doses.</seg>
<seg id="55">According to the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, the dose of ABILIFY should be lifted to the Dosage at the beginning of the companion.</seg>
<seg id="56">In conjunction with ABILIFY the dileman or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 can be used together with ABILIFY, an increase in arithpious concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical studies showed doses of 10-30 mg of Aripipetus per day no significant effect on the metabolism of CYP2D6 (Dextromethorphan / 3-method morphine ratio), 2C9 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Omepraph) and 3A4 (Dextromethorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">People should be advised to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or pregnancy during the treatment of Aripizole.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the inadequate data base on humans and due to the concerns in the reproductive studies in the animal, this drug may not be applied in pregnancy, unless the potential benefits clearly justifies the potential risk for the mocker.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, in other anti-psychotics, patients should be warned against dangerous machines, including power vehicles, to operate until they are sure that Aripipraises had no negative influence on it.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following adverse events were more frequent (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the side-side effects listed below are defined in the following criteria: often (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of over 52 weeks came in patients who were treated with Aripipetism, a total of less incidence (25.8%) of EPS including parkinsonism, acathered, Dystony and Dyskinesis, compared to patients who were treated with haloperil (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study for over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% was in patients under Aripike treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study for over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% was treated with patients who were treated with Aripienszole and 15,1% in patients under Olanzapin therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes on bipolar-I disturbance - In a controlled study more than 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23,5% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 53,3% in patients under Semoperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study more than 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% was in patients under Aripipetus treatment and 17,6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term recovery period over 26 weeks with a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18,2% was treated for patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for placebo treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripivotzole and placebo in which potentially clinically significant changes of routinely controlled laboratory parameters showed no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Enhancements of the CPK (creatine-phosphokinase), generally temporarily and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripizole patients compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">To the side-side effects, which may occur in connection with an antipsychotic syndrome, the maligne neuroleptosis syndrome, Spätdyskesis, and increased mortality in elderly dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus, see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical studies and since its market launch, unintentional or deliberately acute overdossists with an estimated doses of up to 1260 mg were observed in adult patients with an estimated doses of up to 1260 mg.</seg>
<seg id="73">There are no information about the efficacy of a hemdialysis in treatment of an overdosation with Aripiprazole; however, it is unlikely that hematalysis in the treatment of an overdose of benefits, da Aripizole has a high plasma cutting.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripipetus in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder in combination of a partial agonist effect on dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and a antagonist effect is conveyed on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripipetus presented a high affinity to Dopamine D2- and D3-receptor as well as a moderate affinity to Dopamine D4-, for serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7, for alpha-1 adhrine and for histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">At the gift of Aripizole in dosages of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks of healthy volunteers showed a dossier dependent the binding of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3-receptor, on Nucleus caucus and at the putting time.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-time studies (4 to 6 weeks) to 1.228 schizophrens patients with positive or negative symptoms compared to placebo a statistically significant improvement of psychotic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="78">In one semi-controlled study in week 52 the proportion of responsive patients treated to study medication, in both groups like similar (Aripianos 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values of measuring transformers defined as secondary study variables, including PANSS and Montgomery-Asberg- depression scale, showed significantly stronger improvement than in Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study about 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia showed significantly higher reduction in response rate, which was found at 34% in the Aripike group and at 57% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an oozapin-controlled, multinational double-blind study at schizophrenia over 26 weeks, the 314 patients included a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg) with an average weight of approx. 5%.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapies with a flexible dose of more than 3 weeks with a deficienic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disturbance, Aripipetole showed a placebo over against placebo over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapist study about 3 weeks with a fixed dosage with patients with a deficieny or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, Aripipetrels showed no superior efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo- and active mono-controlled monotherapies in patients with a deficieny or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripipetrels showed an extra-lasting effectiveness in week 3 and a sample effect which was comparable to lithium or Haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In addition, Aripipetus also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of Manie on like lithium or Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study about 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, which were partially reflected on lithium or Valproat-Monotherapy, resulted in an overlaid efficacy in cognitive symptoms compared to monotherapies with lithium or Valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study about 26 weeks followed by a long-time extension period over 74 weeks in a stabilisation period before Randomisation reached a remission in response to placebo over placebo was superior to the prevention of a bipolar response, especially in the prevention of a reverse case in the Manie.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the enzyme CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the Dehydration and hydroxyisation of Aripizole, the N-Dealcytic is catalyzed by CYP3A4 catalyzed.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean Eliminationshal period is about 75 hours for Aripipetus with extensive metabolic types over CYP2D6 and about 146 hours at 'bad' (= "Poor") Metabolism over CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripipetus there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, as well as in a pharmacokinetic examination of patients no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A pop-specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics there was no indication of clinically significant differences in ethnology or the effect of pirates on pharmacokinetics of Aripizole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetics properties of Aripipetus and Dehydro-Aripipetus were similar in patients with severe cardiac insufficiency compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study involving volunteers with different grave liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on pharmacokinetics of Aripipetus and the dehydration of liver function, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of class C, which is not enough to pull shots on their metabolic capacities.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on safety technology, toxicity in repetitive gift, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and the channel potential, the preclinical data failed to recognize any special hazards for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only at doses or expositions that exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans, so that they only have limited or no significance for clinical application.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects of the dossier of a dossier in rats according to 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (corresponds to 3 to 10 times of the mean Steady State exposure) and a combined side-to-carcinoma with female rats at 60 mg / kg / day (average 10times of middle steady-State exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose when people).</seg>
<seg id="97">Moreover, a cholesterol was determined as a result of the breakdown of Sulphate conjugate of the Hydroxy- Metabolite concentration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans than the 16- to 81times the recommended maximum dose of humans rated at mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg, the concentration of sulphate-conjugate of Hydroxy- Aripizole was no more than 6% of the concentrations that were detected in the study about 39 weeks in the Galle of apes, and lie far below the limit values (6%) of in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed according to dosages that led to expositions of 3- and 11fold the mean Steady-State AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="299">Pain in the chest wall, weakness of musculature, muscular pain, muscular pain, pain in the skeletal musculature, muscular pain, indiscomfort in the limbs, muscular weaknesses Very frequently:</seg>
<seg id="300">Rowing motion 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reaction is calculated based on a definitive case in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">As these events were reported on voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of actual frequency is possible and no coincidence was established with these events.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is a antimicrotubuli active ingredient that stimulates the fusion of the microtubules from the tubulae and stabilizes the microtubules through the inhibitor of its deolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to a shirt of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubular network that is essential for vitale interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that Albumin mediated the transcycosis of plasma components in the endothelial cells and in the scope of in-vitro studies proved that the presence of Albumin the transport of Paclitaxel supports the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transendothelial transport is conveyed by the gp-60-Albuminous protein and based on the albuminous protein SPARC (rected protein acidic) into cysteine) an Paclitaxel accumulation within the field of tumors.</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two unrivalled studies and of 454 patients who were treated in a randomized Phase III study study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In a study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 has been used as infusion with metastatic breast cancer over 30 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicentre study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer, which received a monotherapist with Paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 as a 3-hour infusion with premediation for prevention of an allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as a 30-minute infusion without premediation (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">During the inclusion in the study 64% of patients had an impaired general state (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metasteries.</seg>
<seg id="311">Only 14% of the patients had not received chemotherapy, 27% had only one adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only due to metastases and 19% due to metastases and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results of the general response and time to progression-free survival and progression-free survival and survival for patients who are &gt; first-line therapy are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neural toxicity compared to Paclitaxel was evaluated by improving one degree for patients who lived at a time during therapy a peripheral neuropathy grade 3.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy to baseline due to the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">Pharmacokinetics of the aggregate Paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusions of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="316">The impact exposure (AUC) increased linear from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml in analogy to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 After intravenous gift of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the Paclitaxel-Plasmaconcentation took over multi-phase mode.</seg>
<seg id="318">The mean distribution volume amounted to 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume has a wide range of extravagular distribution and / or Weights of Paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study involving patients with advanced sound tumours the pharmacokinetic properties of Paclitaxel were compared to intravenous 30 minutes after intravenous 30-minute injection of 175 mg / m2 solvent free Paclitaxel comparatively.</seg>
<seg id="320">The Clearance of Paclitaxel was higher after the Abraxane-gift (43%) and after a solvent containing Paclitaxel injection, and the distribution volume was considerably higher (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">Published in the literature about in vitro studies of the human liver microsome and tissue coating is reported that Paclitaxel is primarily metabolized to 6α -hydroxypaclitel and a two smaller metabolic (3 "p-hydroxypaclitel and 6α--3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the mean value for cumulative urinary tract was 4% of the total dose of less than 1% of the Metabolite 6α -hydroxypaclitel and 3 "-p-hydroxypaclitel, which indicates a far non-renal clearing.</seg>
<seg id="323">Over patients at the age of over 75, however, only few data are available, because only 3 patients participated in the pharmacokinetist analysis.</seg>
<seg id="324">The chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and light-protected light over 8 hours.</seg>
<seg id="325">Paclitaxel is a cytotoxical anticarcinogenous medicine and also in other potentially toxic substances, should be careful when dealing with Abraxane.</seg>

<seg id="359">This means that Absedan is similar to an organic medicine which is already approved in the European Union (EU) and the same substance (also called "reference age").</seg>
<seg id="360">Patients with normal blood circulation values might occur in patients with a blood transfusion complications, if a blood loss is not possible, if a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml may be expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">Treatment with sedamed must be managed under the supervision of a physician who owns experience in the treatment of patients with illnesses, for which the medicine is indicated.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make their own blood pressure, Absedamed is injected in a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">Injection may also be carried out by the patient or his counselections, if they have received an appropriate guide.</seg>
<seg id="364">Patients with chronic renal failure or patients receiving chemotherapy should always be observed in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciter with adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients are used before treatment to ensure that no iron gel consists of iron and iron should be administered during the whole treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy, or patients with kidney problems, anaemia is caused by a Erythropoietine defect or that the body does not suffice to affect the body's own Erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also applied prior to operations to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell that has been incorporated into a gene (DNA) that it is capable of formation of epetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Absedan was compared with the injection into a vein in the framework of a main study with 479 patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems associated with reference problems.</seg>
<seg id="370">All participating patients were enrolled at least eight weeks in Eprex / Erypo in eight weeks before they were either converted to sever or continue to Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main Indicator for efficacy was the change of hemoglobinism between the beginning of the trial and the trial period in weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also laid out the results of a study where the effects of under the skin speckled sever was examined with those of Eprex / Erypo in 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study, patients suffering from kidney problems caused anaemia caused by kidney problems, the hemoglobinary values were observed in the same size as in those patients who continue to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, patients who continue to receive Eprex / Erypo, an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the initial value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most frequent tribution of Abseamed is an increase in blood pressure, which occasionally lead to symptoms of a bovine spongiform encephalopathy (brain problems) as sudden, dropping migrate headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Absedan must not be used in patients who may possibly oversensitive (allergic) against epetin alfa or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="377">Sedamed as injection under the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems because additional studies are necessary to ensure that no allergic reactions are triggered by no allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Humanities (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the medicine has been carried out according to the regulations of the European Union of proof that the medicine has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile such as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company, which sedamed, will provide information on medical staff in all Member States, including information on safety of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="380">In August 2007, the European Commission granted the Medice Medicines Pütter GmbH & Co KG approval for placing the entry of deportation in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="381">Treatment of anemia and reduction of transfusion needs in adults with solid tumours, malignant lymphomas or multiplicity myeloma treated with chemotherapy for example (e.g. cardiovascular status, existing anemia in onset of chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">Treatment should only be carried out in patients with medium-severe anemia (hemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6,2 - 8,1 mmol / l], no iron measures not available or inadequate, for planned larger operations, which require a large blood volume rate (4 or more units blood among women; 5 or more units are blood in men).</seg>
<seg id="383">For reduction of external blood pressure absedan can be applied to an extensive electrical orthopaedic intervention in adults without iron deficiency, in which a high risk of transfusion applications can be expected.</seg>
<seg id="384">HB 10-13 g / dl) and an expected blood loss of 900-1800 ml are applied to participate in an autologous blood donor program.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hemoglobin target concentration lies between 10 and 12 g / dl (6,2 - 7.5 mmol / l), except for pediatric patients where hemoglobin concentration between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l) should lie.</seg>
<seg id="386">Anomalesysymptoms and follications can vary depending on age, gender and total disease; therefore, the assessment of individual clinical trials and disease resistance is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="387">A hemoglobins increase by more than 2 g / dg (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual hemoglobinism can occasionally be observed on or under the hemoglobin- target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">In view of these hemoglobinvariability should be tempted by a corresponding dose management, the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the hemoglobinary exceeds more than 2 g / dg (1.25 mmol / l) per month, if the durable hemoglobinary value exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epetin-alfa dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be engined in order to ensure that epetin alfa is required in the lowest approved dose which is applied to control of anemia and anamiysymptoms.</seg>
<seg id="392">This clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.75 mmol / l) may require higher yield doses (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">This clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low hb value (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.25 mmol / l) may require higher yield doses (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose 50 i.e. / kg three times per week by intravenous application, if necessary, with a dose increase of 25 i.e. / kg (three times a week), until the desired target is reached (this should be done at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Anamiesysymptoms and - Folders can vary depending on age, gender and total disease; therefore, the evaluation of individual clinical trials and disease by the doctor may be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="396">In view of these hemoglobinvariability should be tempted by a corresponding dose management, the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be engined in order to ensure that epetin alfa is required in the lowest approved dose which is applied to control of contingent symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="398">If after 4 treatment weeks the hemoglobinary value of at least 1 g / dg (0.62 mmol / l) or the retinitis increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, the dose should be retained at a rate of 150 i.e. / kg three times a week or 450 i.e. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the hemoglobins increase &lt; 1 g / t (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) and the retinitis increased &lt; 40,000 cells / µl opposite the initial value, the dose should be increased to 300 i.e. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If after further 4 treatment weeks with 300 i.e. / kg three times a week the hemoglobinocum ≥ 1 g / t (≥ 0,62 mmol / l) or the retinitis increased ≥ 40,000 cells / µl to preserve the dose of 300 i.e. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">If the hemoglobinary value is &lt; 1 g / t (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) or the retinitis increased &lt; 40,000 cells / µl opposite the initial value, a response to the epetin-alfa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be canceled.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anemia (hematokrit 33 - 39%) in which the preventured storage of ≥ 4 blood tained should be effected in a dose of 600 i.e. / kg body weight twice weekly for 3 weeks before surgery.</seg>
<seg id="403">The iron substitution should be as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks prior to the start of the autologous blood donor program - started to provide large Iron reserves before the start of the autologous blood donors.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 i.e. / kg of epoxy in alfa, which should be given once a week over three weeks (day 21, 14, and 7) before the surgery procedure and the day of the intervention (day 0) should be given.</seg>
<seg id="405">In this case, epetin alfa was preoperatively 300 i.e. / kg each 10 consecutive days, on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, injection can be given at the end of the dialysis over the hose's hose, followed by 10 ml isotonic saline solution to ensure the hose and ensure a sufficient injection of the medicine in the cycle.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients receiving treatment with any Erythropoetin to an erythroblastopenie (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA) should not get abseamed or another Erythropoetin (see section 4.4 - Erythroblastopenia).</seg>
<seg id="408">Heart attack or stroke within one month before treatment, instabile angina, increased risk for deep vendors (e.g. anamnestically known venous Thromboembolien).</seg>
<seg id="409">In patients who are intended to participate in an autologous blood dontic program, the application of epetin alfa in the following prosy, peripheral arterial disease infection, vascularial disease, vascular disease of cardiac disease; in patients with recently registered heart attack or cerebrovascular event.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastopenia (PRCA) Very rare has been reported using subcutaneous Erythropoetin over the appearance of an ancient-boiled PRCA after months of months.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden loss of effects, the reduction of hemoglobinism (1 - 2 g / dl per month) is determined with increased demand for a non-loss (iron, folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, infection or inflammation, blood loss and hemolysis).</seg>
<seg id="412">If the Retikulocytes value, taking into account of anaemia (i.e. the Reticulocytes "Index"), the thrombocytes and leukocytes are normal (&lt; 20,000 / mm3 or &lt; 0.5%), and if no other reason of any loss is found, the Anti-Erythropoetin antibody should be determined and an investigation of the bone cord to diagnose a PRCA diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="413">The data for immunogenicity in subcutaneous use of wastes in patients with a risk for an antibody-induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 For patients with chronic renal sufficiency should not be exceeded in accordance with Section 4.2 recommended upper limit of hemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical studies, an increased mortal risk and risk for serious cardiovascular disease were observed, when Erythropoese stimulating entities (ESA) were given with a hemoglobinism target concentration of over 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have not demonstrated a significant benefit that is due to the gift of epetines, if the hemoglobination over the concentration of angiesysymptoms and the prevention of blood transfusions required.</seg>
<seg id="417">The hemoglobins should not exceed 1 g / t (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month to minimize the risk of hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic renal sufficiency and clinically insufficiently coronarer cardiac insufficiency should not exceed the recommended upper limit of hemoglobin target concentration in section 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the time of these findings, the treatment of anemia with epetin alfa in adults with kidney failure, which are not dialysis (dialysis), which does not accelerate the progression of renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="420">In case of tumor patients with chemotherapy, a 2-3-week delay between epetin-alfa-Gabe and Erythropoetin response should be taken into account (patients who may have to be transluded).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the hb increase is higher than 2 g / dg (1.25 mmol / l) per month, or a hb value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l), the dose must minimize the risk of possible thrombotic events (see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chemotherapist anaemia (10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision for application recombinant Erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk consideration under the involvement of the respective patients who should also consider specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients who are intended for a larger elective orthopaedic procedure, if possible, before the beginning of the epetin-alfa therapy, the cause of anemia were examined and treated accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients who submit to a larger elective giosis prophylaxis, because they have an increased risk for thrombotic and vascular diseases, especially at an access-roomovasculous disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">Moreover, in addition, treatment with epetin alfa for patients with a starting dose of &gt; 13 g / dl provides an increased risk for postoperative thrombotic / vascular events.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled trials, it was not detected for epoxy patients suffering from symptoms with symptomatic anemia or reduce the risk of the tumor.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy was brought back when a hemoglobin target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl (7.5 - 8.7 mmol / l) was aspired</seg>
<seg id="428">If Epoetin alfa was applied together with Ciclosporin, the blood level of Ciclosporin controls and the Ciclosporous dose should be adjusted to rising hematokrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">In-vitro research on tumor tissue there are no evidence on a interaction between epetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF regarding hematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">About thrombotic, vasculous events such as myocardians, myocaress, arterial Thrombosis, pulmonial thrombosis, cerinalthrombosis and 11 blood clots in artificial kidney disease was reported in patients under Erythropoetin treatment, as well as patients with epetin alfa, reported.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most common adverse events during the treatment with epetin alfa is a dossier increase in blood pressure or deterioration of an existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">An increased incidence of thrombovasculum events (see section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients under the treatment of erythropoetines.</seg>
<seg id="433">Irythropoetin treatment, it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated bleeding to thrombotic and vascular complications.</seg>
<seg id="434">The genetically obtained epetin alfa is glycoilated and regarding the amino acids and carbohydrates of carbohydrates with the endogenous human erythropoetine, which was isolated from the urine wall patients.</seg>
<seg id="435">It was shown with the help of cultures of human bone marksals that epetin alfa specifically stimulates the Erythropoese and did not affect the Leucopoese.</seg>

<seg id="635">Effect on the bone mineral density (BMD) in the HORIZON-RFT study increased the Aclasta treatment in comparison to placebo treatment with the BMD in total hardness and pain-hals at all times.</seg>
<seg id="636">The Aclasta treatment carried out more than 24 months compared to placebo treatment for an increase of the BMD by 5.4% at the total hardness and 4.3% at Schenkelhals.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy of men in the HORIZON-RFT study were randomized 508 men, and in 185 patients the BMD was assessed after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to increase the reduction of clinical trials in men; the frequency of clinical trials was 7.5% in Aclasta-treated men compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in males (study CZOL446M2308), the once annual administration of Aclasta was involved in comparison with the percentage change of the lumbar BMD after 24 months compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical efficacy of treatment in moray Aclasta was examined in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radiological deterioration of the bone (medium serum levels of alkaline phosphatase, according to 2.6fold up to 3.0fold of age-specific upper normal value when recording in the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The effectiveness of an infusion of 5 mg of zoledronic acid in comparison to intake of 30 mg fraedronat once a day during 2 months was demonstrated in two six-month comparison studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">After 6 months, a similar decrease in pain strength and pain-pain was observed compared to the initial value for Aclasta and Risedronat.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified at the end of the six-month main study were classified as Responsibility (on the therapy), could be included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">Patients treated with Aclasta and 107 with Risedronat treated patients who participated in the follow-up study was 141 of patients with Aclasta compared to 71% of treated patients treated with Risedronat treated patients who are treated with a mean follow-up period of 18 months after application.</seg>
<seg id="645">Unique and multiples 5 and 15 minutes lasting infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg of Zoledronic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetics data that had become abnormal.</seg>
<seg id="646">Thereafter the plasma levels rapidly decreased rapidly at &lt; 10% of the maximum value to 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 h, followed by a long lasting phase, no more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rasches biphasic disappearance of the large circulation with half-value t ½ α = 0,24 and t ½ to 1.87 hours, followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination of a ½ g of 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early distribution phases (α and β, with the above ½ -values) probably represent the rapid resorption in the bones and the deposition about the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours there are 39 ± 16% of the administered dose in urine, while the rest is bound mainly to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body-Clearance is independent of the dose 5.04 ± 2,5 l / h and remains unaffected by gender, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion time from 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of Zoledronacid concentrations by 30% at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the surface below the curve (plasma concentration against time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A reduced cleance of caused by cytochrome P450 enzymes is unlikely because Zoledronic acid is not metabolized because they are a weak or no direct and / or irreversible, metabolic dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see section 4.2) correlated Clearance of Zoledronic acid correlated with Kreatine cleance, namely 75 ± 33% of creatine cleance, and in the 64 examined patients in average 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">It follows that a light (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate renal disorder up to 35 ml / min does not require dose adjustment of the oledronic acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">As for severe kidney disturbance (Kreatin- Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min), there is no limits for this population no statements possible.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-acting intravenous individual dose was 10 mg / kg body weight and 0,6 mg / kg body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">For studies on dogs single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on the AUC the 6times of recommended human therapeutic exposure), administered over a period of 15 minutes, good and without any renal influencing.</seg>
<seg id="658">Subchronic and chronic toxicity In studies with intravenous application the renal tolerability of Zoledronic acid was administered in 3-day intervals, a total of 6 times (an cumulative dose which corresponds to the 7fold of human therapeutic exposure, related to AUC, corresponds to the AUC, corresponding).</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated application with cumulated expositions, which exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure, the toxic effects of other organs, including gastrointestinal tract and the liver, as well as at the intravenous injection point.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most frequent findings in studies with repeated use was an increasingly primary Spongiosa in the metaphysise of the long bones with almost all doses, a refunds that reflects the pharmacological, antiresortive effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">In rats we observed a teratogenicity at doses of 0.2 mg / kg as external and inner (visceral) abnormalities and such a skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">In rabbits, no teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed, although the maternal toxicity were detected at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of the lowest serum-calcium mirror.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR to the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Event report (EPAR) in which the study evaluated the Study for Human Resources (CHMP) to access the recommendations regarding the application of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is applied to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes) patients (especially overweight patients) in patients (especially overweight patients). • It can be applied together with other diabetics. • It can be applied together with another diabetic medicine.</seg>
<seg id="751">Additionally, it can be applied to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients) that can not be adjusted using metformin only in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulphylic acid or insulin, the previous dose of the sulphylic acid or insulin can be maintained continuously, except for patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar level); this should be reduced the dose of sulphylic acid / insulin or insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the physical insulin is better tolerated and the blood sugar level has to be adjusted better, resulting in type 2 diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of acetones in tripletherapy was investigated; in addition, patients received a combination of metformin with a sulphylbidye, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In studies, the concentration of a substance in blood (glycoylized hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured that shows how good the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a lowering of the HbA1c value, which restricts the blood sugar levels for the dosages of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the trial treatment, the effect of an additional gift of acetone to existing treatment with metformin and a sulphur jacket in a reduction of the HbA1c values decreased by 0.94%, while the additional administration of placebo led to a reduction of 0,35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, in which the combination of Actos and insulin was investigated, patients who participated in addition to insulin, a decrease of HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared with 0.14% in patients who took in addition to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events in connection with acetcars were sealant, infections of the upper respiratory (pathologic), weight gain and hypothesis (reduced sensitivity to friction).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos must not be applied to patients who may not react to patients with liver problems compared to pioglitazone or one of the other components, still in patients with liver problems, cardiac insufficiency (high Ketonic mirror - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in patients where metformin is not shown.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission granted Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited approval for the placing of vehicles in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white to white, round, curved and carry on one side the marking "15" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination with insulin-type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is adjusted with insulin and incompatibility due to contraindications or incompatibility (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">To use Pioglitazone for patients under 18 years of age are no data available, therefore the application is not recommended in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients receiving at least one risk factor (e.g. from earlier heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease) to develop a decompensated congestive heart failure, the doctor should start the treatment with the lowest recommended dose and increase the dose gradually.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a cardiac insufficiency, particularly those with reduced cardialer reserves.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a cardiac insufficiency, weight gain and oils in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome study with pioglitazone in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and existing macrovascular disease was carried out.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in reports of congestive heart failure, which however did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output liver values (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the standard area) or with other signs of a liver disease may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirrors are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range, the liver values are as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient is developed that indicate a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, tiredness, fatigue, appetite and / or darker Harn, are the liver values to check.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of patients with pioglitazone will continue to be redirected to the main laboratory parameters of clinical assessment.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with pioglitazone, a dosed-dependent weight gain was detected, which can be heralded by grease deposits and in some cases linked to a liquid remuneration.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a hemodilution, a lower reduction in central hemoglobinon treatment (relative reduction of 4%) and hematokrits (relative reduction of 4.1%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative studies with pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobins by 3-4% and hematokrits by 1-2% and hematokrits by 1-2% and hematokrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of the increased insulin sensitivity, the Pioglitazone increased as oral divisions, or triple-combination therapy with a sulphylic acid or as a dual-level combination therapy with insulin, the risk of dosages of hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">Following the market launch, under the treatment of thiazolidacons, including Pioglitazone, including a occurrence or deterioration of a diabetic macular edema with a reduction of visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between taking Pioglitazone and the occurrence of macular edema to be aware of a macular edema to report patients over disturbances of visual acuity; an ophthalmologic examination should be considered into account.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of messages indispensable events in the bone-brood, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture-incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years with pioglitazone treated women and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years with women who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the proactive study, a study of over 3.5 years on investigating cardiovascular events, fractures were treated with 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patients) with pioglitazone compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0,5 fractures per 100 patient years) patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of a pregnancy, and if a patient wishes for a pregnancy or occurs in case of pregnancy, treatment (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies for investigation of the interactions have shown that Pioglitazon does not have relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmaceutical Dynamics of Digoxin, Warfarin, phenol and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contrast ratio, Cyclosporin, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA-reduction inhibitors are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with gems (a cytochrome P450 2C8- Inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the AUC of Pioglitazone to 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with Rifampicin (an cytochrome P450 2C8-induction) resulted in a lowering of the AUC by Pioglitazone at 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the treatment with pioglitazone who decreased hyperinsulinemia and increased insulin-resistant viruses and reduces the availability of metabolic substrates for reddish growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; frequently &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (from this data not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="791">This lead to a temporary change in the tower and the refractive index of the lens, as they are also observed in other hypoglycaemic effect.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with pioglitazone, ALT-Anstiege stood over the three times the upper limit of the normal range than below placebo but more rarely than in comparative groups under metformin or Sulfonylbidye.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with advanced macvascular disease, the incidence of severe cardiac insufficiency was 1.6% higher than in placebo when Pioglitazon or bzw.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since its market launch, rarely has been reported on congestive heart failure under Pioglitazone, but more frequently when Pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin-sufficiency in the Anamnaval.</seg>
<seg id="795">There was a summary analysis of Messages of randomized events in terms of bone-controlled, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone groups and over 7,400 patients treated with comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="796">Over a period of 3.5 years current proactive study, fractures were treated with 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with pioglitazone compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, 180 mg / day had no symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone seems to work specific kernel receptors (peroxic proliferative reptor-g (PPAR-γ), which results in the animal model to an increased insulin-sensitive sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazone reduces Glucosa production in the liver and increases the peripheral scorching devaluation in case of insulin-resistant.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazone versus Gliclazid as a monotherapy was continued over two years to investigate the therapeutic efficacy (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time two years after the beginning of therapy, a blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) in 69% of patients treated patients (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclazid).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study more than 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was adjusted in inadequate processing phase with insulin, to Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under pioglitazone, the mean HbA1c was reduced by 0.45% compared to the patients who still only received insulin; a reduction of the insulin one group treated with pioglitazone group was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year, a statistically significant decrease of the albumin / Kreatinin-Quotients showed a statistically significant decline in comparison with the output values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazone (Monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was checked in a small, based on 18 weeks for type 2 diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical studies, a reduction of the total plasma triglyceride and the free fatty acids and an increase in the HDL- cholesterol levels and slightly lower, however clinically unsignificantly increased LDL- Cholesterinspiegel.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years was Pioglitazone compared to Plazebo, metformin or Gliclazid the total plasmatriglyzeride and the free fatty acids and increased the HDL cholesterol.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to Plazebo, no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol was detected, whereas Metformin and Gliclazide diminished values were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazon reduced not only the sober-triglyceride, but also improved the postprandial triglyceride mirror, this both via a effect on the Triglycerid absorption as well as to the hepatic Triglycerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the proactive study, a kardiovascularial outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing macrovascular disease were randomised in addition to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, Pioglitazone gets quickly resorously, with the top concentration on the unchangeable Pioglitazon in plasma usually 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV corresponds to the effectiveness in about the threefold of the effectiveness of Pioglitazone whereas the relative efficacy of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In intervention trials, Pioglitazon has no relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmaceutical Dynamics of Digoxin, Warfarin, phenol and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with gems (a cytochrome P450 2C8 Inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (an cytochrome P450 2C8-induction) increases or reduces the plasma concentration of Pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">According to the legal application of radioactive Pioglitazone, the marker was found mainly in barriers (55%) and to a lower extent in Harn (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The average plasma-elimination process of unaltered pioglitazone is 5-6 hours, while the entire active Metabolite is between 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentration of Pioglitazon and its Metabolite are lower than in patients with reduced renal function, however, the rates of oral cleance of the maternal clearing is similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies in mice, rats, dogs and apes, agree to repeated administration volume enlargement with hematlution, anemia and reversible excentric cardiac disease.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to be due to the treatment with pioglitazone which reduces hyperinsulinemia and increased insulin-resistency and therefore reduces the availability of metabolic substrates for reddish growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years), increased incidence of hyperplasia (male and female rats) and tumours (with male rats) of the urinary bladder cancer were induced.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of family tomatous polyposis (FAP) led the treatment with two other thiazolidIndia to an increased frequency of Kolontumors.</seg>
<seg id="822">The tablets are white to white, round, flat and wear on one side the marking "30" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="823">The calculated fracture-incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years with pioglitazone treated women and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years with women who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the proactive study, a study of over 3.5 years on investigating cardiovascular events, fractures were treated with 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patients) with pioglitazone compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0,5 fractures per 100 patient years) patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study on two years, the effects of combination therapy of metformin with Pioglitazone or Gliclazide were examined.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year, a statistically significant decrease of the albumin / Kreatinin-Quotients showed a statistically significant decline in comparison with the output values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazone reduced triglyceride levels, but also improved the postprandial increased triglyceride mirror, this both via a effect on the tryglyzerid absorption as well as to the hepatic Trygimerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study was missing regarding their primary endpoint, a combination of mortality, non-deadly myocardial infarisation, leg amputation above the Knukularisation, and Revascularisation of leg arteries, put the results close to the intake of Pioglitazon no cardiovascular risk.</seg>
<seg id="829">The tablets are white to white, round, flat and carry on one side the marking "45" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="830">In a summary analysis of Messages of randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone and more than 7,400 patients showed a increased incidence of bone clocks at women.</seg>
<seg id="831">In the proactive study, a study of over 3.5 years on investigating cardiovascular events, fractures were treated with 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patients) with pioglitazone compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0,5 fractures per 100 patient years) patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>

<seg id="864">Actraphane was investigated in a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes, where the pancreas can produce no insulin, and type 2 diabetes, in which the body is not capable of using insulin.</seg>
<seg id="865">After 12 weeks the concentration of a substance (glycoylized hemoglobin hemoglobin (HbA1c) was measured, which shows how good the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="866">Actraphane led to a decrease in HbA1c-Spiegels, which indicates that blood sugar levels have been lowered similarly to another humankind.</seg>
<seg id="867">Actraphane should not be applied in patients who may possibly react sensitive to human insulin (rDNA) or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="868">In addition, the cans of Actraphane must be adjusted, if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can result in the blood sugar (the full list is to be found).</seg>
<seg id="869">The Committee for Humanities (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Actraphane weigh over the risks associated with diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="870">In October 2002, the European Commission granted Novo Nordisk A / S approval for placing the placing of Actraphane throughout the European Union.</seg>

<seg id="873">Patients whose blood sugar setting is significantly improved by an intensive insulin therapy, hypoglycaemia warning symptoms can be perceived and should be advised accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any change in terms of strength, brand (manufacturer), insulin-phase, insulin-phase (insulin-insulin, insulin-insulin, insulin or insulin-insulin) and / or manufacturing method (by recombinant DNS compared to insulin-animal origin) means that a change in dosage is required.</seg>

<seg id="1402">Since Tacrolimus and Prograf / Prograft has already been used in the EU, the company has presented the results from previously carried out studies with Prograf / Prograft as well as data from published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1403">Furthermore the results of a clinical study was presented to 668 patients with kidney transplantation, whereby the application of advagraf was compared with Prograf / Prograft or Ciclosporin.</seg>
<seg id="1404">The main Indicator of efficacy was the number of patients where the transplantation was dropped from a year (by example, for example, a new organ transplant or a resumption of dialysis was needed).</seg>
<seg id="1405">In addition, shorter studies of 119 patients with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplant transplantation was performed and examined how advagraf is absorbed by comparison with Prograf / Prograft from the body.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only doctors who are familiar with immunity-intensive therapy and treatment of transplant patients should provide this medicine or make changes in the immunity-intensive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Because of clinically relevant differences of the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus, this can lead to transplant reactions or an increased incidence of side effects, including subdu- or overhead.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same tactile formulation and the respective daily dosage; provisions of formulation or the regime should only be performed under engined control of one in transplantation (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">In a consequence of a changeover to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic pharmaceutical monitoring and corresponding dosages must be carried out in order to ensure that the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus remains.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dose of Advagraf should be primarily based on clinical assessment of ablation and tolerability in individual cases and on blood-level regulations (see below "Recommendations</seg>
<seg id="1415">After changeover from Prograf to Advagraf, the Tacrolimus valley should be controlled by changing and controlled via two weeks after changeover.</seg>
<seg id="1416">On Day 4, the systemic exposure, measured as a valley level, was comparable to both renal and liver transplant patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated controls in the Tacrolimus Talking controls are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation, to ensure reasonable substance exposure in direct transplant phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Since Tacrolimus is a substance with low Clearance, an adjustment of the pre-dose pre-dose may take several days until the Steady State is reached.</seg>

<seg id="1420">Duration of the application for suppression of transplantation, the immune response has to be observed; therefore, a maximum duration of oral therapy can not be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Dose recommendations - kidney transplantation, corneal transplantation therapy should begin with 0.20 - 0.30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Another dose adjustments can be necessary later, as the pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus can change in the course of stabilization of patients after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dose recommendations - liver transplant prophylaxis of transplantation therapy should begin with 0,10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dosage recommendation - conversion from Prograf to Advagraf must be converted a transplant receiver of twice daily dosage of prograf capsules to a once daily dosage of lessons, so this changeover must be carried out at a time of 1: 1 (mg: mg).</seg>
<seg id="1425">Kidney and liver transplant According to a changeover of other immunomressiva to advagraf once a day, the treatment with kidney transplantation is recommended for prophylaxis of transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Transplantation For adult patients who are converted to advagraf is an orale initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day once a day in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplant sufferers have no clinical experience with advances in lung cancer, pancreas and darsplant patients, came to pancrematured patients in a oral initialant dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in intestinal transplantation in an oral initialant dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dose adjustments in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function For maintaining blood levels in the targeted range can be necessary in patients with severe liver function disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced renal function when the kidney function does not influence the pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus, can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrine potentials of Tacrolimus, however, a careful monitoring of renal function (including a regular determination of the serum-creatine mirror, recommended calculation of creatinine and a monitoring of the urinary volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Changeover of Ciclosporin to Advagraf at the changeover of a Ciclosporine - a Tacrolimus-based therapy is caution (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Recommendations to the level mirror in full blood the dose should be based on clinical assessment of perseverance and tolerability in individual cases of whole blood-tackling-tacular mirror checks.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform frequent controls from the Tacrolimus canal levels during the first two weeks after Transplantation, followed by periodic inspections during the maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood-talus mirror from Tacrolimus should also be changes after conversion from Prograf to Advagraf, Dosage adjustment, amendments to the immune-intensive therapy or for simultaneous use of substances which could change the tacular fibulation concentration (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since advagraf is a medicine with a low level Clearance, adaptations of the dose may require several days, until the Steady State did occur.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical studies suggest that a successful treatment is possible in most cases if the valley levels should not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the valley levels of Tacrolimus in full blood in the first time after liver transplant usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and with hinges - and warm transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent detection of liver, renal and cardiac grafts, blood concentrations in the range from 5 - 15 ng / ml were generally used.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events, including graft reactions or other side effects, which may occur in the sequence of Tacrolimus sub or exposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same tactile formulation and the respective daily dosage; provisions of formulation or the regime should only be performed under engined control of one in transplantation (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 In the treatment of adult patients with graft reactions, which had been treated with other immunophensiva, there are no clinical data for retaliated formulation of advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1442">To the prophylaxis of the graft reactions in adult heart graft, and transplant-graft in childhood are still no clinical data for retardized formulation of advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Because of the possible interactions that lead to a downturn of the Tacrolimus mirror in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of Tacrolimus is the intake of vegetable preparations (hypericum perforation), or to avoid other plant remedies during treatment with advagraf (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimus concentrations in the blood has been instructed, since the Tacrolimus blood level can be subjected to such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, under Prograf was a case of coalomyopathy, chamber or septumatic trophic was observed, which can therefore occur under Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disturbances are a treatment of cortieroids, hypertension, kidney or liver function, infections, fluid overloading and oil.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As in other immunomressiva the impact of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of malignant skin changes due to appropriate clothing or use of a sun protection with a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients who take Tacrolimus, symptoms of pres such as headache, changing awareness of forces, forces and vision should show a radical investigation (e.g.</seg>

<seg id="1450">The simultaneous application of medicines or vegetable healers are known as inhibitor or inductors of CYP3A4 which can affect the metabolism of Tacrolimus and thus reduce blood values of Tacrolimus or lower.</seg>
<seg id="1451">Therefore, the Tacrolimus- blood level can be used for simultaneous gift of substances which can change the CYP3A metabolism and to adjust the tactile dose to maintaining consistent concentrations (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A strong interchangeable action was used with Antimykotica as Ketoconazole, Fluconazole, Itraconazol and Siliconducol as well as the Macrolid antibiotic Erythromycin and HIV protease inhibitor (z.</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetics showed that the increase of blood levels mainly from the increased bioavailability of Tacrolimus, caused by inhibiting the gastrointestinal consistency.</seg>
<seg id="1454">High-speed prednisolone or methylprednisolone, as it is used in acute remedy reactions, can increase the concentration of Tacrolimus in the blood or lower.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The effect of Tacrolimus on the metabolism of other medicines Tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitor; therefore, the simultaneous application of Tacrolimus with medicines are metabolized by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Since Tacrolimus reduce the clearing of steroid arthritis, and thus increasing the hormonal exposure, it is particularly careful in decisions concerning the prevention measures.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal experiments have shown that Tacrolimus will reduce the Clearance of Pentobarbital and phenazone and their half-time delay.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a small number of investigations on transplantation patients do not provide any note that in the Tacrolimus compared to other immunophensiva an increased risk for unwanted events associated with regard to the course and the result of pregnancy.</seg>

<seg id="1531">Dosage and frequency of application will be addressed to whether the treatment is applied to the treatment of hemorrhages or prevention of blood patients.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with hemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, which causes blood clillings like bleeding in the joints, muscles or inner organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma, but according to a method that is known as "recombinant DNA technology":</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the initial rollment of available data, the CHMP has continued to be positive, but consider that the safety profile has to be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, the CHMP is based on the basis of the Security Council of ADVATE, which makes a submission of PSURs all 6 months, decided that the allowance for 5 years should apply a further extension procedure.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited adopted the Committee for Humanities (CHMP), that the company will resume its application for marketing authorization to the treatment of Li-Fraumeni's cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the breast, the brain, the bones or the wheat parts (tissues, the other structures in the body combines and supported) of it.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a kind of virus that's genetic so changed that it can bear a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">With the virus in Advexine, this is a "Adenovirus," which was so changed that there is no copies of himself, and therefore no infections can be redeemed in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin would have been injected directly into the tumors and allow the cancer cells to form the normal p53-protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53-protein that is formed from the non-faulty human body existing p53 gene, usually carries the restoration of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA can not be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">In Li-Fraumeni's cancer, with which the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein doesn't work properly, and the cancer cells can grow further and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study involving a patient in front of the Li-Fraumeni's cancer in the subdivision, in the bones and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP had examined the answers to the question of the company, there were still some questions unexplained.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the testing of initially submitted documentation, the CHMP created a list of questions that will be sent to the company.</seg>
<seg id="1650">The CHMP opinion was not sufficiently demonstrated that injection of Advexin in Li-Fraumeni-Tumors provides benefits for the patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The Committee had further concerns relating to the processing of the medicine in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that advances can be established in a reliable way and that there is neither for the environment nor for people who are in a way contact with the patient, are harmful.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company used the CHMP not knowing the response consequences for patients who currently participated in clinical trials or "Compassionate-Use" programs with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"modified drug release" means that the tablets are assembled so that one of the effective components are immediately released and the other is released slowly over a few hours.</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used for the treatment of the seasonal allergy rhinitis (locustucking, caused by a allergy against pollen evoked inflammation of the nose) in patients with nasal mucous membranes (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and teenagers over 12 years, the recommended dose of Aerinaze twice daily is a tablet that should be taken with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (crammed nose), are plotted out.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicine can be recharged on the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main effective measures were the changes in the severity of the locustrade symptoms who have been reported in the treatment before the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In consideration of all the locali symptoms except the constipation of the nose reported patients that Aerinaze revenues, compared with a decrease of symptoms by 46.0%, compared with 35.9% in the patients receiving Pseudoephedrin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa showed, the patients showed a reduction of symptoms by 37.4% compared with 26.7% in patients receiving the desloratadine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common adverse events of aerinaze (observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are tachycarcinoma (hypertension), oreyngitis (appetite), constipation, fatigue, fatigue, Insomnia (insomnia), somnolenz (sleeity), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze must not be applied in patients who may possibly overpressure (allergic) against desloratadine, pseudoephedrin or one of the other components, against adsorge active ingredients or Loratadin (another drug for the treatment of allergies) are not applied.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze can also not be applied in patients who suffer from a bottangle glaucoma (hypertension), hyperthyroid (hypertension), hyperthyroid (overfunction of thyroid) or already caused a haemorrhagic strike (caused by a brain circulation) or have a risk for a haemorrhagic punch.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted approval to the company SP Europe granted approval for the placing of aerinaze in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, however, it can be swallowed up in the whole (i.e. without having to crushed or cut off).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be applied to children under the age of 12 due to the lack of data and effectiveness (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days, as for long-term application the activity of pseudoephedrin can take time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After a decline in swelling of mucous membranes in the upper breaths the treatment can be continued with desloratadine as a monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerinaze Pseudoephedrin contains the medicine also contra-indexed in patients who are treated with a monoaminoxidase (MAO) inhibitors or within 2 weeks after the completion of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is based on the alphamimetical activity of combined application of pseudoephedrin with other vascrimp, Lisurid, Cabergolin, Dihydroergotamine or other deconiva, phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, Ephedrin, Oxymetacolin, napkins, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and effectiveness of these combination therapy were not checked for this patient-shaft and the data are not sufficient to arrange relevant recommendations to the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Safety and the efficacy of aerinaze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver function, and the data are not sufficient to arrange appropriate Recommendations on the Dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that the treatment of hypertension or tachykarate or from Palpitations, cardiac arrhythmia, nausea or etwaigen other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or a amplification of the headache) must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="1677">For the treatment of the following patient groups: patients with hypertension • patients with hypertension • patients with hypertension • patients with a myocardial infarction in the Anamorphine, Diabetes mellitus, bladder cancer, or bronze statue in the Anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is carried out at least 48 hours prior to the conduct of dermatological tests, as antihistamine, otherwise positive reactions have to prevent adverse reactions to skin activities or reduce their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the context of clinical trials with Desloratadine, where Erythromycin or Ketoconazole were given, however, no clinical interactions or changes of the plasma concentration of Desloratadine were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">In the results of the psychic testing, no significant differences between the patients treated with desloratadine and the placebo could be detected, irrespective of whether desloratadin alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for Metabolism of Desloratadine enzyme was not yet identified, so that interactions with other medicines may not be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin inhibits in vivo CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibited and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The inconcality of the application of aerinaze during pregnancy is not secured, yet with a large number of affected pregnancies, however, no increase in frequency of abnormalities in comparison with normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Because Reproductive studies on animals can not always be transferred to humans and are not applied on the basis of vasofermented properties of Pseudoephedrin, Aerinaze should not be applied in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should however clarify it that in very rare cases, it can come to an impairment of transport or ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms can vary between a tick depression (sedation, apnoe, diminded mental attention, cyanesthesia, Koma, cardiovascular colluity) and a tick-stimulation (insomnia, Hallucinations, Tremor, Convultures) with potential letting.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headaches, anxiety, exhaustance microtations, muscular heart failure, cardiac insufficiency, nausea, vomiting, dical pain, dizziness, tinnitus, respiratory diseases and hypertension or hypotonia.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A tick-stimulation is particularly likely to children, as well as Atropin typical symptoms (mouthfulness, pupillenvire and - Dilatation, hood, hyperthermia, and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both the inhibition of the release of proinflammatory cytokinen such as IL-4, IL-8, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophile a P selection of endothelial cells in endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">When a single dose trial with adults showed Desloratad5 mg no effect on standard measurement sizes of the flight performance including the amplification of subjective or the tasks that are connected to the fly.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials, at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily, no increased frequency of strokes in comparison to placebo were noted.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of Pseudoephedrin in the recommended dosage can reveal another listic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, a tachykarate or manifestations of a ZNS detection.</seg>
<seg id="1693">It took 1,248 patients at the age of 12 to 78 years with seasonal allergy rhinitis, with 414 patients Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies, histaminant efficacy of aerinaze tablets, determines from the total score for symptoms (except nasal mucuous membranes), significantly higher than under a monotherapist with Pseudoephedrin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The efficacy of aerinaze tablets in terms of swelling effect, determines from the nasal mucuous effect, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with Desloratadine about the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The efficacy of aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender, age or ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose trial for pharmacokinetics of Aerindler, Desloratadine has been demonstrable within 30 minutes after administration in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of aerinaze with healthy subjects over 14 days the flow-weight of Desloratadine, 3-hydroxygiloratadin and pseudoephedrin, was reached on Day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In the context of a pharmacokinetetic multi-level study, which was performed with the formulation of a tablet to healthy adult subjects, it was noted that four subjects of desloratadine was badly damaged.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A components-interaction study shows that exposure (Cmax and AUC) of pseudoephedrin according to the sole gift of Pseudoephedrin bioequivalent was the exposure to the administration of an Aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional studies on security spicology, for toxicity in repetitive gift, for genotoxicity and to reproductive applications, the preclinical data with desloratadine has not recognize any special hazards for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no bigger toxicity than their individual components, and observed effects were generally related to the content of Pseudoephedrin.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive-stoxicological studies, the combination of Loratadin / pseudoephedrin was not terated in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">March 2007 and implemented in 1.8.1 the Pharmacology system described in Module 1.8.1 and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistaminika contribute to the increasing symptoms of allergic symptoms by causing histamine, a physical substance that can develop its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Aerinaze tablets linens symptoms that occur in connection with seasonal allergy rhinitis (hayloft), such as nibal, running or juckering or juckling eyes with continuous constipation of the nose.</seg>

<seg id="1721">For children ages six to eleven years, the dose is 2.5 mg once daily, either in the form of 5 ml syrup or bzw.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was studied in eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four trials with seasonal allergies and two studies in patients who had also asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The efficacy was measured by using the change of symptoms (itching, number and size of quakes, impairment of sleep and performance on day) before and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies were presented to prove that the body makes the syrup and the solution to remove and remove the melting tray in the same way as the tablets and the use of children unthinkably.</seg>
<seg id="1725">For allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg of Aerius became an average decrease of symptoms (symptoms) by 25 to 32%, compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In both studies in Urticaria, the decrease of symptom score after six weeks of treatment with Aerius 58 and 67% compared to placebo patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerial may not be used in patients who may possibly oversensitive (allergic) against desloratadine, Loratadin or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission issued a licence for the placing of Aerius in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once a day, with one or without a meal, for the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and Urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There are limited experience from clinical trials for efficacy in the application of Desloratadine from 12 to 17 years (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of intermittent allergy rhinitis (the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks) should be taken according to the previous illness and can be terminated following the symptom of symptoms and resumed with its resumption.</seg>
<seg id="1732">The persisting allergies (the occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks) can be recommended during the allergy time a continuous treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were found in clinical trials with Desloratadin tablets, where Erythromycin or Ketoconazole were given in addition (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical-pharmacological study, with the benefit of Aerius and alcohol is not increased the most effective effect of alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should however clarify that it can come in very rare cases that may lead to an impairment of transport or ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical studies in various indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more side effects in patients with Aerius were reported as patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common adverse events that were more common than in placebo were fatigue (1,2%), mouth dry (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study with 578 adolescent patients from 12 to 17 years, the most frequent tributs was treated with 5.9% of patients who were treated with Desloratadine and at 6.9% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">A multidose study that were administered at up to 45 mg of Desloratadine (nine different clinical dose) were not observed clinically relevant effects.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both the inhibition of the release of proinflammatory cytokinen such as IL-4, IL-8, IL-8 and IL-13 from human macells / bophile a P seless of endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">In the context of a clinical study with multiple doses, in the desloratadine dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical-pharmacological study, in the desloratadine dose of 45 mg daily (the ninth time of clinical dose) was administered over ten days, no extension of the QTc intervals.</seg>
<seg id="1743">When an individual dossier with adults showed Desloratad5 mg no effect on standard measurement sizes of the flight performance including the amplification of subjective or the tasks that are connected to the fly.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in the alleviation of symptoms such as Niats, Nasenroltion and Juckreiz of the nose, Juckreiz, Tränenflow and Selling of the palate as well as Juckreiz at the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis can alternatively be divided in intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent allergic Rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As demonstrated by the total score of the questionnaire to strengthen the quality of life in Rhino-subtivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the burden of seasonal rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronic idiopathic uria was examined as a representative for further forms of Urticiia since the underlying pathophysiology remains similar in the different forms of similar forms and chronic patients can be prospective.</seg>
<seg id="1750">As the histamine release is a potential factor in all the ariarial cases, Desloratadine is expected to improve the symptoms of the chronic idiopathic uria, as well as other forms of the Urticaria, which is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic uria, Aerius was effective in the improvement of Pruritus and the decrease of size and number of Quaddling at the end of the first time interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistammelamine in chronic idiopathic uria, the minority was not affected by antihistaminika, from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">An improvement in the itching rate by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with Desloratadine patients compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">The treatment with Aerius reduced the disturbance of sleep and growth, as measured by a 4-point scale to evaluating these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetics study where patients treated with the general seasonal allergic rhinitis of Rhinitis was comparable to 4% of patients a higher concentration of Desloratadine.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no liability for clinically relevant Kumulation after once daily use of Desloratadine (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, it was not identified for Metabolism of Desloratadrenal enzyme, however, that interactions with other medicines will not be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadin inhibits in vivo-CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibited and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dossier with Desloratadine with a dose of 7.5 mg, meals (greasy, calory rich breakfast) does not affect the availability of Desloratadine.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The study of Desloratadine and Loratadin performed in a comparable degree of exposure of desloratadine, no qualitative or quantitative differences in regards to the toxicity studies of Desloratadine and Loratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on conventional studies on security spicology, toxicity in repetitive gift, genotoxicity and to reproductive toxicity, preclinical data with desloratadin doesn't recognize any special hazards for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="1762">Color film (includes Lactose Monohydrat, Hygrommet, Titanium dioxide, Macrogol 400, Indigocarmin (E 132), colourless film (includes hygrommers, Macrogol 400), Carnaubaeswax, a slight wax.</seg>
<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken independently of the meals to reduce symptoms in allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and Urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescription doctor ought to be aware that most cases of Rhinitis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection (see below section 4.4) and that no data are presented, which support a treatment of infectious rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory diseases or anatomical anomalies, the diagnosis of Anamorphosis, physical investigations and respective laboratory tests should play a role.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Approximately 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years abolizes desloratadine and learn a higher substrate (see under section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius syrup in children between 2 and 11 years, metabolized, is identical to the children that metabolizes the normal.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This medicine contains sucrose and sorbitol; therefore, patients with herdentary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-gactose-absorbing or a sucrose-isomaltas- insufficiency does not take this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinically relevant interactions were given in clinical trials with Aerius tablets, where Erythromycin or Ketoconazole were given in addition (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinical-pharmacological study, with the benefit of Aerius tablets and alcohol is not increased the most effective effect of alcohol (see below section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">The total hardness of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Aerius syrup group, like the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="1772">In clinical studies with adults and adolescents in various indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, at the recommended dose 3% more side effects in patients with Aerius, were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1773">A multidose study of adults and adolescents, administered by up to 45 mg of desloratadine (nine different clinical dose) were not observed clinically relevant effects.</seg>
<seg id="1774">Children between the ages of 1 and 11 who came to an antihistamine treatment, received a daily dose of 1.25 mg (between 1 and 5 years) or 2.5 mg (aged between 6 and 11 years).</seg>
<seg id="1775">Because the course of allergic rhinitis / chronic idiopathic uria and the profile of Desloratadine in adults and children can be similar, the efficacy data of desloratadine for adults can extrapolishes for children's population.</seg>
<seg id="1776">In the context of a clinical study involving multiple outlets in adults and adolescents, in the desloratadine dose of up to 20 mg daily, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1777">In a clinical-pharmacological study of adults and adolescents, in the desloratadine dose of 45 mg daily (the ninth time of clinical dose) than ten days in adults showed no extension of the QTc intervals.</seg>
<seg id="1778">In controlled clinical trials, at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents, no increased frequency of strokes in comparison to placebo were noted.</seg>
<seg id="1779">With a single daily dose of 7.5 mg Aerius tablets led in adults and adolescents in clinical trials to no impairment of psychotics.</seg>
<seg id="1780">In clinical-pharmacological studies in adults it came to an increasing consumption of alcohol neither to a amplification of alcohol induced power gripping even to an increase of the hatchess.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In adult and adolescent patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius tablets were effective in the alleviation of symptoms such as Niats, Nasenroltion and Juckreiz of the nose, Juckreiz, Tränenflow and the throat of the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1782">How to use the total score of the questionnaire to strengthen the quality of life in Rhino-subtivitis, Aerius tablets effectively minimized the caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis</seg>

<seg id="1894">Afunov should be applied in adults and elderly people to protect the flu, which is caused by the tribe (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special kind of vaccine that could cause a strain of influenza, which could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">An influenza panes breaks out when a new tribe of influenza panes that can easily spread from human beings, because people cannot have no immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">After administration of the vaccine, the immune system detects the parts of the influenza virus as "physical foreign" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system is able to compose faster antibodies in a contact with a flu virus.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membranes of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface, which recognizes the human body as a foreign), are cleaned and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">One of some of the study sites showed that the study was not conducted according to the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">This reduces the scope of clinical data base to assess the safety of the vaccine to meet the requirements of the guidelines of the EMEA region for pre-panic vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">If you take part in a clinical study and require further information about your treatment, please contact your doctor's doctor.</seg>
<seg id="1903">For further information on the basis of the recommendations of the CHMP, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is applied in combination with other antiviral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years that are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), which are infected with accumulated immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who can't swallow the capsules, asgenase is as a solution for inclusion, but this cannot be taken together with Ritonavir because the safety of these combination was not studied.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Agenase should only be prescribed if the doctor has chosen the antiviral medicines of the patient before, and the likelihood has said that the virus will appeal to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, taken together with twice daily 100 mg of Ritonavir and with other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">In children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of asgenase is based according to body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">Generic reduces the HIV-quantity in combination with other antiviral medicines in combination with other antiviral medicines at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">AIDS is not to heal AIDS, however, the damage of the immune system, and thus creating the development of AIDS related infections and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenase was investigated in combination with other antiviral medicines, however without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had not been treated with protease.</seg>
<seg id="1912">This enhanced Ritonavir reinforced drug Agenase was compared with 206 adults who had taken former protease inhibitor compared with other protease inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1913">Main Indicator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-proven concentrations of HIV in the blood (virusload) or the change of viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies of patients who had previously taken no protease inhibitors had already taken a viral load of 400 copies / ml compared to placebo but nogenase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">With children, Agenase also reduced the viral load, however, of the children who had been treated previously with protease inhibitor, only very few to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who had been treated previously with protease inhibitor, linked to Ritonavir reinforced drug Agenase the virusload after 16 weeks of treatment as well as other protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In the patients with HIV which was resistant to four other protease, it came under Agenase along with Ritonavir to a stronger waste of virusload after four weeks as in the patients receiving its previous protease:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common adverse events of Agenase (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headache, diarrhoea (dialysis), nausea (nausea), nausea (nausea), vomiting, skin rash and Fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenase should not be applied in patients who may possibly be sensitive to ambavir or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Atrium must also be applied in patients, the Johanniskraut (a vegetable preparation for treatment of depression) or drugs, as well as Agenase, and in high concentrations in the blood of health are harmful.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other drugs against HIV, patients suffering from disease progression or osteoystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), an osteoekrose (extinction of bone tissue) or a immune activating agent (symptoms of infection that are caused by the restorative immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The concluding Committee for Humanities (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Agenase in combination with other antiretroviral medicines to treat patients treated with HIV-1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks associated with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenase is generally taken together with the pharmacokinetist amplifier Ritonavir, but the Committee pointed out that the benefit from asgenase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who had previously taken no protease of inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1924">Agenase was originally approved under "extraordinary circumstances" as at the time of approval for scientific reasons, only limited information.</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000 the European Commission granted the Glaxo Group Limited approval for the placing on placing Agenase in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Generic is in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1 infected, protease inhibitor (PI) treated adults and children from 4 years onwards.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually, Agenase capsules should be administered to the pharmacokinetic boosters of ambavir together with low doses of Ritonavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of ambavir should be performed, considering the individual viral resistance pattern and pretreatment of the patient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The availability of ambavir as a solution to the unicamavir solution is less than capsule; therefore Agenase capsules and solution can not be interchangeable on a milligrams per milligrams basis (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended adult dose is 600 mg of Amonavir twice daily along with 100 mg of Ritsavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenase capsules are applied without the addition of Ritonavir (booster), higher doses have to be applied to Agenase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Acease capsules is 20 mg of Amonavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg of Amonavir which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of asgenase in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other Protocols was not studied with children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Atrium is not recommended for use in children under 4 years due to the absence of data to incomprehension and effectiveness (see section 5.2).</seg>

<seg id="1975">If this drug should be used at the same time, be careful, since Delavirdin because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma must be less effective.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If this medicine is used together, caution is commanded; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be performed because a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of ambavir and Ritonavir is difficult to Delavirdin.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous gift of ambavir and Riyutin resulted in an increase in plasma concentration (AUC) of Riyutin by 193% and thus to increase the side effects associated with Riyutin connected side effects.</seg>

<seg id="1990">Since plasma levels of these HMG Coa-reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathy including a wealdomolysis, the combined use of this medicine is not recommended with ambavir.</seg>
<seg id="1991">There is a common monitoring of therapeutic concentrations as to stabilization of mirrors, since the plasma concentration of Cyclosporin, Rapamycin and Tacrolimus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore Agenase should not be applied together with an oral malolzolam (see section 4.3), while at the same application of asgenase with parentous Midazolam caution is commanded.</seg>

<seg id="1996">In simultaneous gift of hot or other oral anticoagulants along with Agenase, an increased control of INR (International standardization ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of a weakening or reinforcement of antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir based on hormonal contradiction is not predictable, therefore alternative methods recommended to conception.</seg>
<seg id="1998">A careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended for simultaneous gift of asgenase (see section 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="2025">Genotypical resistance-based analysis systems can be used to evaluate the activity of ambavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitor-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm is defined as the presence of mutations V32I + 147A / V, or I50V, I54A / L / W / W / W / W / W / W / W / W / W / W / W / W / W / W / W / W / W / W / W / W / W / W / W / W / W / W / V, I54V and L90M in conjunction with a increased probability of a virological contact (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutation patterns can subject to changes due to additional data, and it is recommended to use the current interpretations for analysis of the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Phenotypical resistance-based analysis of clinical data interpretations can be used in combination with genotypical data for estimation of ambavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitor-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies representing diagnostic resistance tests have been developed clinically-phenotypical Cut-offs (dividing points) for FPV / RTV which can be used to interpret results of a resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to ambavir associated genetic patterns generates a certain cross-resistant against Ritonavir, the sensitivity to indinavir, cloviavir and saquinavir but generally retained.</seg>

<seg id="2033">In addition, ambavir retains its activity against some other protease inhibitors against isolate insulators; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The early termination of a versing therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mutations in limits that can result in the following treatment pieces.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The evidence of the efficacy of aggenase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily based on the study PRO30017, a randomised open study (600 mg twice daily) together with Ritonavir (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, primarily associated with lowest Ritonavir "geboostert" received.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred threescore (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity compared to Agenase, at least another PI and at least one NRTI were included in the research study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis set the non-undersuperiority of APV / Ritonavir compared to the time adjusted average change of the output value (AAUCMB) in plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-sub-wave threshold of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The cover of the efficacy of unroasted Agenase based on two uncontrolled studies with a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 were treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenase solution was taken in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, with the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">It was not given a low dose of Ritonavir at the same time; the majority of the patients treated with PI previously treated at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs containing Agenase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of patients included a plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration of &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml for a median increase in CD4 cells of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74).</seg>
<seg id="2042">19 Based on these dates should be considered for the treatment of treatment with PI pensive benefit from "ungebooky" Agenase. "</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral administration, the average duration (Tmax) to the maximum serum concentration of Ambavir is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increased, for Cmax, by 30%, when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered along with amperavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of ambavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of Amonavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimal concentration in the steady state (Cmin, ss) remained unaffected by the food intake, although the simultaneous intake is influenced by the extent and the rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg) and can be attached to a large distribution volume, as well as a broken penetration of ambavir from the blood circulation system.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change led to a decrease in the concentration of concentration in plasma, with the amount of frosted amblown, which represents the active portion, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Whereas the absolute concentration of unbound amblown up remains constant, the percentage of free active components remains in dependence on the aggregate physician at the Steady State in the Steady State over the area of Cmax, ss-Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, medicines containing CYP3A4 or inhibitions or a substrate of CYP3A4 must be given with caution when they are given simultaneously with generic (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice, or 15 mg / kg three times a day, leads to a similar daily Amonavir exposure such as adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Ambavir is made from the solution 14% less biavailable as from the capsules; therefore Agenase solution and generic capsules are not interchangeable on a milligrams basis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">The renal cleance of Ritonavir is negligible, therefore the effect of a renal disorder on the elimination of Amdetavir and Ritonavir is likely to be low.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment schemes lead to ambavir plasma levels which is comparable to healthy subjects after a dose of 1200 mg of Amonavir twice daily without simultaneous administration of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies with amperogenicity in mice and rats introduced with male animals benigne hepatocytes (mice) or 3.8- (rat) of exposure to humans, after twice daily gift of 1200 mg of Amonavir, said.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of hepatocytes Adenomas and Carcinomas was not yet resolved and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">From this study data on humans, both clinical studies and therapeutic use, however, little indications for the assumption of a clinical relevance of these findings.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of In-vivo- and in-vitro-Genotoxicity tests, the bacterial reverse mutation tests (Ames test), microcore test on rats and chromosomes tolerance in human peripheral lymphocytes were ambavir nor genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">This liver toxicity can be monitored and proven in clinical everyday life by measurement of AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">Previously in clinical trials no significant liver toxicity was observed in patients, neither during the administration of Agenase even after the end of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies to toxicity in young, which have been treated from an age of 4 days, exhibited both in the control and the amblown of the animals had a high mortality.</seg>
<seg id="2062">In a systemic plasma exposure that was significantly higher (rabbit) or not significantly higher (rats) than the expected exposition under therapeutic dosage, however, a series of slight changes, including thymusongation and minor skeleton changes, observed on a delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If Agenase capsules are applied without the addition of Ritonavir (booster), higher doses have to be applied to Agenase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Acease capsules is 20 mg of Amonavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg of Amonavir which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">The simultaneous application should be used in patients with weak or lighter liver function, in patients with severe liver function, it is contra-indexed (see section 4.3).</seg>

<seg id="2236">The calculated risk time was about 10times higher than the 2-hour half time after the subcutaneous application in a previous study; it shows an extended retention of the medicine in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Data on systemic exposure showed that the absorption of Imiquimod was low in patients aged 6-12 years and comparable to healthy adults and adults with actinent notatosis or superfiable basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study to sample toxicity in the rat-plate doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg, significantly reduced the body weight and elevated spleen weight; another four months results showed no similar effects in the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study for carcinogenicity in mice at least three days a week induce no tumors on the use of use.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The corresponding mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimod has only a low systemic absorption of the human skin and not mutations, is a risk for people because of systematic exposure than very low.</seg>

<seg id="2277">The study was mainly investigated by the safety of the medicine, however, however, its effectiveness was measured (by reducing the GAG's concentrations in urine and relative to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under five years, Aldurazyme increased the GAG's concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of the treated children showed a normal liver on the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common adverse events of Aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headache, abdominal pain, arthropathy (joint pain), back pain, pain in limbs (in hands and feet), heat, fever and reactions to the infusion station.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very frequent side effects in patients under five years of age are elevated blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measuring size of lung function), tachycares (accelerated heart rate), fever and scrubbing.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not react in patients who may not react heavily oversensitive (allergic) to Laronidase or one of the other components (anaphylactic reaction), do not be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will update every year all new information that may potentially be announced, and this summary will be required.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme will receive patients who observe Aldurazyme as regards the reactions to the infusion and development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted the company Genzyme Europe B.V. an authorization for the placing of Aldurazyme throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of the human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced by recombinant DNA technology using cho-mammals cell cultures (Chinese Hamster Oheads, Eierstock of the Chinese hamsters).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indexed for long-time enzymes in patients with a safe diagnosis of a Muizysaccharid I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hermetable metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">If the patient can increase the initial rate of 2 E / kg / h, if the patient is wearing this, all 15 minutes can be increased to a maximum dose of 43 kg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">Safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in adults aged 65 years was not determined and no dosing system can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver insufficiency has not been determined and no dosing system can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients with Aldurazyme treated patients can develop infusively reactions, which are defined as each in the context of the infusion level, which occurs during infusion or by the end of the infusion level (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, these patients should continue to be monitored continuously, and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only be made available in a reasonable clinical environment, where reanimate facilities are now available for medical emergencies.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, nearly all patients IgG antibodies against Laronidase form, usually within 3 months from the course of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infusionist reaction, must be treated with care of Aldurazyme with caution (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Since little experience in regard to the treatment of treatment after a longer interruption, the risk of hypersensitivity may be cautious because of the theoretical increased risk reaction after an interruption of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the beginning of the infusion with medications (antihistamine and / or antipylock) to minimize the potential occurrences of infusionist reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of light or medium-severe infusians reaction, treatment with antihistamine and paracetamol / Ibuprofen should be voiced and / or a reduction of infusion rate on half of the infusion rate, where the response has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In the case of a single, severe infusious reaction, the infusion must be stopped, until the symptoms are brought to decline, treatment with antihistamine and paracetamol / Ibuprofen is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion rate can be resumed with a reduction in infusion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of infusion rate when the reaction has occurred, resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3. (antihistamine and paracetamol / Ibuprofen / iris / or Corticosteroids) and a reduction in infusion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of infusion rate, where the previous reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with chloroquin or procain, because a potential risk of interference with intracellular intake of Laronidase consists.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not leave to direct or indirect impacts on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since no data about newborns that were exponated against Laronidase, are highly recommended, during treatment with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Side effects in clinical trials were classified predominantly as infusible reactions, which were observed in 53% of patients in the phase 3 study (treatment duration up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants below 5 years (treatment duration up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Unwanted pharmacies in connection with Aldurazyme, which were observed during the phase 3 study and of its extension at a total treatment duration of up to 4 years, are listed in the following table following the following frequency: very often (≥ 1 / 10); frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related participation of the upper respiratory tracts and lungs in the prehistory occurred severe reactions, including bronchospels, respiratory and facial oils (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Unwanted Medicinal impacts in connection with Aldurazyme, which have been reported in a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5, with mainly serious deterioration and a treatment duration of up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients it came within 3 months after the treatment to a seropversion, whereby it came to a serre version during the age of 5 years (average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Up to the end of the Phase 3 study (or up to premature extinction from the study) in 13 / 45 patients were demonstrable due to radioimmunisation (RIP) Assay, including 3 patients who never came to Serre version.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with missing up to low antibody level showed a robust reduction in GAG Spiegels in Harn, whereas in patients with high antibody titers a variable reduction of GAG in Harn was set up.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in the phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study) showed a marginally neutral to low neutralizing effect on the enzymatic Laronidase- activity in vitro which seemed not to affect the clinical efficacy and / or reducing GAG in Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies seemed to stand in connection with the incidence of adverse reactions, even if the occurrence of adverse reactions were typically associated with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reasons for the enzyme therapy is in one for the Hydrolysis of the acute substrate and preventing an additional accumulation due to the encumulation of enzymes.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, Laronidase is rapidly removed from circulation and cells into lysosomes, most likely about manose-6 phosphat- receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 45 patients at the age of 6-43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, the majority of the patients were randomized, the majority of the patients ranged from the middle phenotype and only one patient showed the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were randomised to recruit if they had a forated expiratorial volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the absolute walk in the 6-minute test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were recruited for an open-label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Aldurazyme for another 3.5 years (182 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, patients treated with Aldurazyme received an improvement in lung function and the ability that is shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">In an open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintaining this effects of up to 208 weeks in derdurazyme / Aldurazyme group and of 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the expected FEV is not significantly less than this period clinically significantly and the absolute lung volumes increased further proportionally to the height of increasing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a hepatomic cloths of treatment reached 22 (85%) until the end of the study a normal liver size.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks, a significant decline in the GAG mirror revealed in Harn (µg / mg Kreatinin) which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">Regarding the heterogeneous pathology of patients, clinically significant changes, clinically significant changes for five efficacy variable (compared to expected), course in 6-minute test (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration of 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year-old open phase 2 study was conducted in which mainly security and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme was investigated at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age (16 patients with heavy course type and 4 with the middle course type).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosing was increased due to increased GAG- mirror in the Harn Week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients showed an increase in size (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) and all 4 patients with the mean follow-up form (&lt; 2,5 years) and all 4 patients with the mean follow-up form had only limited or even no progress in cognitive development.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase-4 study, investigations into the dynamic effects of various aldurazyme dosing schemes were carried out on the GAG mirror in Harn, the liver volume and the 6-minute test test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosing scheme with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can represent in patients who have difficulties with weekly infusion; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical efficacy of these two dosing schemes is equal.</seg>

<seg id="2387">In clinical studies, patients with a creatine cleance of ≥ 45 ml / min were not necessary to adjust the dose adjustments based on all patients with recommended dose adjustments.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data base in patients with a creatine cleance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function limit of &gt; to the 1.5-fold of the upper limit value (in cases of liver metastases) or &gt; 5,0-fold of the upper limit value (in presence of liver metastases) was not especially studied in studies.</seg>

<seg id="2391">A dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of absolute neutral number, thrombooms and maximum non-hematological toxicity, as observed in the previous therapy cycles (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction of degrees 3 / 4 hematological and hematological toxicity like Neutropenie, febrile Neutropenie and infection with degree 3 / 4 neutropenie was used when a pretreatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore all patients have to be treated with Pemetremixed patients, folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophy- lakestic measure to be treated with reduced toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to medium renal sufficiency (creatinine-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid simultaneous non-steroid antiphic acid (NSAIDs) such as Ibuprofen and Acetylsali- cyleic acid (&gt; 1.3 g daily) for at least 2 days prior to therapy, on the day of therapy and impairment (see section 4.5).</seg>

<seg id="2402">Therefore, be careful if patients with normal kidney function (Kreatine-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) must be used high doses of NSAIDs or Ace- tylsalicyllic acid in high dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen or Acetylsalicyl- acid in high dosage for at least 2 days prior to therapy, on the day of therapy and minimum, 2 days after the therapy with pemetremixed (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since there is no data regarding the interaction potential like Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous application with pemetreformers must be avoided for at least 5 days prior to the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with pemetre- mixed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The large intra-individual variability of the immune status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires an increased surveillance rate of INR (International standardization ratio) when the decision was taken to treat patients with oral anticoagulants.</seg>

<seg id="2518">As the weight reduction in diabetes, with improved metabolic control, patients who take a medicine for diabetes, before the start of an therapy with alli has a doctor or pharmacies because the dosage of anti-diabetic must be adapted.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients who eat alli as well as medicines for hypertension or higher cholesterol levels should consult their doctor or pharmacies if the dosage of this medicine must be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2520">It is recommended to meet additional fluctuating measures in order to prevent severe diarrhoea reductions in the case of severe diarrhoea (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">Both in a study on interactions of medicines as well as in several cases associated with orlistat and Ciclosporin became a decrease of the Ciclosporin plasma pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2522">In combination with warmbs or other orally anticoagulants in combination with orlistat, the Quick-values (internationally normalized ratio, INR) could be influenced (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">In most patients who were treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with orlistat, the concentrations of vitamins A, D, E and K and the beta carotene remained in the standardised area.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, the patient should be recommended to take a supplementary multivitamin supplement to ensure sufficient vitamine intake (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">After the gift of a single dose Amiodarone, a limited number of healthy volunteers were observed, at the same time Orlistat received, a lower decrease in the Amiodaron plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect adverse impacts on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and depend on pharmacological effects of the medicine, since the absorption of recorded fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">The gastrointestinal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporarily.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The complexity are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 10, &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) and very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on the available data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The incidence of known adverse events that were detected after the market launch of Orlistat is not known as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of certain extent.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† It is plausible that the treatment with alli can lead to defaults in terms of possible or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800mg orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times daily were administered over a period of 15 days to normal and overweight people, without significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">In the majority of calculated cases of orlistat-overdosation, no side effects or similar adverse events were reported at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on examinations on humans and animal, of a fast response of a systemic effect, which can be attributed to lipascal properties of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect sets in the lumen diameter and the upper dintestine from covalent bonds to the active Serin-rest of the gastric and pancreatic lipase.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Clinical trials was derived from clinical trials, that 60 mg orlistat, taken three times a day, the absorption of about 25% of the food-fetch is blocked.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled studies on adults with a BMI of 28 kg / m2 prove the efficacy of 60 mg orlistat, which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypothesic, fetal-induced nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameters, the change in body weight compared to the initial value (at the time of Randomisation), was calculated as follows: as a percentage of the body weight in the course of study (Table 1) and as proportion of those who have lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their output weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although the weight reduction was observed in both studies over 12 months, the biggest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average change in total cholesterol was 60 mg -2.4% (initial value of 5.20 mmol / l) and placebo + 2.8% (initial value of 5.26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average change in the LDL cholesterol was 60 mg -3.5% (initial value 3.30 mmol / l) and with placebo + 3.8% (initial value 3.41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">In the waist range the average change is 4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (output 103.7 cm) and with placebo -3.6 cm (initial value 103,5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentration of non-metallized orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after oral gift of 360 mg orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, the therapeutic doses of plasma was not metallized in plasma, only sporadically and extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0,02 µmol) and without signs of a cumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">In a study involving adipous patients, of which the minimal systemically stressed dose could be identified, namely M1 (in position 4 hydrolyzed Lacton ring) and M3 (M1 according to the N-Formyl-Leucine group), identified nearly 42% of the total concentration.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is applied in chemotherapies, which are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting (like Cisplatin), as well as chemotherapies, the moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting (such as cyclophosphamide, dooxorubicin or Carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The efficacy of Aloxi can be increased by the additional gift of a Corticosteroids (a medicinal product that can be used as anti-emetry).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The use of patients under 18 years of age is not recommended since the effects in this age group is not enough information.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active ingredient prevents one chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as Serotonin) to prevent the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was studied in three main studies on 1 842 adult, chemotherapies, which have strong or moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">For chemotherapies, the strong triggers for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients showed no vomiting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy (132 by 223), compared with 57% of patients treated with Ondansetron treated patients (126 from 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">For chemotherapies, the moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients showed no vomiting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy (153 of 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with Ondansetron treated patients (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In comparison with Dolasetron, these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission granted Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. a approval for placing the market of Aloxi throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indexed: for prevention of acute nausea and vomiting near vigoretogenic chemotherapy and prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderate chemotherapy due to cancer illness.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of alxi to the prevention of nausea and vomiting, which is induced by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy, can be amplified by adding the Corticosteroids.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can extend the colon image, patients with anamnesty Obligation or signs of a subacute Ileus should be monitored according to injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">As with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, be careful not to extend the gift from Palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients where the QT- interval is extended or tend to an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In connection with any other chemotherapeutics gift, alxi is to be used to treat nausea and vomiting in the days after chemotherapy, nor for treatment of nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, Palonosetron resistant to tumours activity of five investigated chemotherapeutics (Cisplatin, Cyclophosphamide, cycloabubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study there was no significant pharmacokinetical interaction between a one-time intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a steady concentration of phosphonosetron, an CYP2D6 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a population based pharynokinetist analysis it was shown that the simultaneous gift of CYP2D6-Inhibitors (Amiodarone, coxetubine, oxetine, paroxetine, asidin, ranitidin, Ritonavir, Sertralin and Terbinafin) did not have significant impact on the Clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience for the application of Palonosetron in human pregnancies are not before, therefore Palonosetron should not be applied with pregnant women unless the doctor should be deemed necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical studies the most common with a dose of 250 micrograms of watching adverse events (altogether 633 patients), at least possibly with alxi were related, headaches (9%) and Obituation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions at the administration location (burning, hardening, complaints and pain) were reported in post-marketing of experience.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage, similar frequency values of adverse events were observed, as in the other dosing groups; there were no dose of active relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were carried out, due to the large distribution volume, a dialysis but probably no effective therapy for an Aloxi- overdosation.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1.132 patients were treated with ≤ 50 mg / m2 Doxorubicin and 250 mg / m2 Doxorubicin and 250 mg / m2 intravenous phosphamide (half-time 4 hours) or 100 mg of Dolasetron (half-time 7.3 hour), which was given to Day 1 without Dundethason intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study there were 667 patients who received a strongly etogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 of Cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazin as well as 250 mg / m2 of Cyonosetron, with patients compared to 32 mg of Ondansetron, which were given to Day 1 intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of studies with moderate chemotherapy and the study with strongly etoetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables:</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical studies for the indication of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of Palonosetron were similar to blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters, including the corresponding effects of Ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After the findings of clinical studies, Palonosetron has the ability to block the Ionic and Repolate isation of Ionenkins and extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study carried out at 221 healthy volunteers were the assessment of the ECG-effects in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg in single doses.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After intravenous administration follows an initial decrease of plasma concentration as a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal penalty of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area below the concentration time turn (AUC0- ∞) are generally proportional to the entire dose range of 0.3- 90 μ g / kg when dogs and cancer patients are proportional.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After intravenous administration of Palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the intraocular tumor patients ranged between day 1 and day 5 (± SD) increases from pallonosetron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Out of the pharmacokinetist simulations that once a daily intravenous gift of 0.25 mg Palonosetron reached 3 consecutive days, overall exposure (AUC0- ∞) reached a result after a single intravenous administration of 0.75 mg; however, the Cmax was higher after the classification of 0.75 mg higher.</seg>
<seg id="2640">Approximately 40% of the kidneys should be eliminated and roughly 50% are transformed into two primary Metabolite, compared to Palonosetron in less than 1% of the antagonist effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies for Metabolism, CYP2D6 and, in lower case, the Isoenzyme CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After a intravenous individual dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron, approximately 80% of the dose found within 144 hours in urine, Palonosetron as a non-altered active substance increased about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a one-time intravenous monastine projection, the total body size 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal cleance were 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">In cases with severe liver function, the terminal elimination of the terminal elimination and average systemic exposure with palonosetron increases, but a reduction of the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical trials, effects were observed only after expositions which are considered enough about the maximum human therapeutic exposure, which indicates a small relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 out of pre-clinical studies demonstrate that Palonosetron can only block at very high concentrations of hedron channels, which are involved in the ventricular de- and repolarization and extend the action period.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose has been given in approximately 30 times the therapeutic exposure of human exposure, endocrine neoplasm (in thyroid, pancreas, pancreas, pancreas, pancreas, pancreas, pancreas, pancreas, pancreas, pancreas, pancreas) and skin cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the used high doses and because Aloxi is appointed for one-time application, the relevance of these results is small rated for humans.</seg>

<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon set up data that indicate the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (active structure, composition and purity of the medicine, effectiveness, safety and efficacy of hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study to patients with hepatitis C, the efficacy of Alpheon was compared with the efficacy of the reference to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study was measured as many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment of treatment to the medicine (i.e. no indication of the virus caused by the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">Furthermore, concerns are expressed as soon as the data for the stability of the active substance and the pharmaceutical products were not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C which spoke in the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A, was similar in clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After setting the treatment with Alpheon, the disease in more patients returned to more than with the reference company; Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from that, the study was introduced to the examination of the question, to what extent the medicine is an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibody - special proteins - against drug), does not validate adequate.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used for the treatment of imetigo (one with pitstenosis inferior skin infection) and small infested intoxications (Rissor or chives), deceleration and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used for the treatment of infections, which have been demonstrably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because alarm go does not work against this type of infections may not work.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be applied in patients from age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years of age may not exceed 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient insists on treatment for two to three days, the doctor should be investigating investigating patients and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced) and inhibits the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The major indices of efficacy was in all five studies of patients whose infection was cancelled after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of the 71 patients under placebo spoke to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin wounds, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar rates: if the results of both studies were taken together with skin wounds, about 90% of patients were treated with both groups.</seg>
<seg id="2681">However, in these two studies, however, Altargo was found in the treatment of waste (failed cavities in the body tissue) or of infections which have been detectable, or probably caused by MRSA, not effective enough.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common tribution with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) is a coefficient of irritation at the order.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The concluding Committee for Humanities (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Altargo during the short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections opposite the risks: • Impetigo, • infected small infirmary, decks or genalyte wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted the Glaxo Group Ltd. a approval for the market traffic of Altargo in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients who have no improvement in cases within two to three days are supposed to be considered again and an alternative treatment will be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the case of a sensizing or heavy local irritation through the application of Retapamulin Salbe, the treatment should be broken off, the salbe carefully abouts and an appropriate alternative treatment of infection.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin should not be applied to the treatment of infections where MRSA is known as narreger or assumed (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical studies in secondary operations the efficacy of Retapamulin in patients with infections, which caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative treatment is supposed to be considered if a 2- or 3-day treatment does not occur any improvement or deterioration of the infected place.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of Retapamulin and other topical funds on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous application of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to its small plasma concentration, which were achieved when people were achieved on a diced skin or intrinsically superficial wounds, clinically important shirts are not expected in vivo (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After the simultaneous gift of 2 times daily 200 mg of ketoconazol, the mean Retapamulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax gradually increased to topical application of 1% Retapamulin Salbe to a diced skin of healthy adult men around 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to small systemic exposure according to topical application in patients can not be maintained when topical Retapamulin is applied during a systematic treatment with CYP3A4 Inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral intake and are inadequate regarding a statement regarding impact on the birth and the redale / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">The Retapamulin Salbe should be used only during pregnancy, when a topical antibacterial therapy is clear and the application of Retapamulin is recommended in the gift of an systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In the decision whether the breastfeeding / terminated / terminated or terminating the therapy with Altargo, it is possible between the benefit of the breastfeeding and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical studies of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, the Altargo was the most frequently reported side effects of Irritation at the administration place, which is about 1% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Effects of Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic cate of Pandroutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The effect of the Retapamulin is based on the selective inhibitors of the bacterial protein synthesis due to a certain binding place of the bacterial ribosomes, which differs from the binding bosom of other antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data point out that the binders of the ribosomales protein L3 is involved in the region of the ribosom P-binder and the Peptide transferred centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By joining this binding agent Pandroutiline the Pepperdyltransfer, block some P-binder interactions and prevent the normal education of active 50s ribosomaler shelters.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Due to the local prevalence of resistance the application of Retapamulin should appear at least some infectious diseases, a consultation by experts should be targeted.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in in vitro activity of Retapamulin compared to S.aureus regardless of whether the insist is sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of non-appealing to the treatment at S.aureus, the presence of tribes with additional viral factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption in a study involving healthy adults has been applied 1% Retapamulin Salbe daily under occlusion on intact and lowered skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children), who received 1% Retapamulin Salbe twice daily for 5 days for the topical treatment of secondary wounds, individual plasma samples were gained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">Rehearsal was performed on the days 3 or 4 during adult patients each prior to the mediation and in the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic intake of the people after topical application of 1% Salbe put down to 200 cm2 (0-24) = 238 ng / ml) 660 times lower than the Retapamulin IC50 for the PGP inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of Retapamulin in human liver microsomes was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, among low involvement of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on oral toxicity in rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were carried out more than 14 days, there were evidence of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro review on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse-lymphoma test, or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in rats-core test in vivo-vivo investigating effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There was neither male responding in female rats for reduced fertility at oral doses of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, resulting in the highest exposure of exposure to humans (topical application to 200 cm2 with diced skin):</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study on rats were diagnosed with oral doses of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (according to the ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure (see above), development of toxicity (reduced body weight of the mocker) and maternal toxicity.</seg>

<seg id="2717">Irritation or other signs and symptoms show in the treated spot, you should end the use of Altargo and speak with your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not apply other ointments, creams or lotional on the surface that is treated with Altargo if it has not been prescribed by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It must not be applied in the eyes, in the mouth or on the lips, in the nose or in female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">If the ointment looks on one of these areas, wash the place with water and ask your doctor for advice, if complaints appear.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases related to the liver) in children aged between one and 15 years that are not yet immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is applied within two doses of vaccines, whereby the protection against hepatitis B may be reached only after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix can only be used when immunisation is a lower risk of hepatitis B infection, which is ensured that the vaccination plan can be led out of two doses.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a collecting dose against hepatitis A or B is desired, Ambirix or other Hepatitis B or B vaccine may be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines work by causing the immune system (the natural defences of the body), "as opposed to a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child has received the vaccine, the immune system detects the viruses and surface antigens as "foreign" and creates antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same components as the vaccinated vaccine Twinrix Adults and the vaccine Twinrix Kids since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are applied to protect against the same diseases, however, Twinrix Adults and Twinrix children are administered as part of one of three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinrix adults are also based as a cover for the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main Indicator for efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed one month after the last injection a protective anti-body concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children the efficacy of the vaccination was compared to a six-month and a 12 month distance between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix led to hepatitis A and B after the last injection of a month after the last injections to the development of protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambirix was in a six-month and a 12 month distance between injections similar.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common adverse events of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccines) are headaches, appetizer, pain on injection, redness, fatigue (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">In patients, Ambirix must react to the active ingredients, one of the other components or neomycin (an antibiotic) to be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission granted GlaxoSmithKline Biology.o. a approval for the placing of Ambirix in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standard dimplying plan for the Grundimplying with Ambirix consists of two vaccines, whereby the first dose is administered at the time of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a restrictive surgery is required for hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B, can be vaccinated with the corresponding monovent vaccines or with a combination-simulation.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B virus (anti-HbsAg) anti-hepatitis B virus (anti-HAV) anti-body values are observed in the same size order, according to vaccination with the respective monovent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not completely secured whether the immune expert persons spoke to hepatitis C vaccination, because they are also protected against the immune memory via the immune memory.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As for all injections, for the rare case of anaphylactic reaction, according to the gift of vaccination, corresponding possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring will always be available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a fast protection against hepatitis B is required, the standard dimplunge fema is recommended that contains 360 ELISA units formalinactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B Surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In hematalysis patients and persons with disruption of the immune system there is no adequate anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies resulting in these cases the gift of additional vaccines may be required in these cases.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since a intraoral injection or intramuscular administration could lead to a suboptimal import effect, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">However, ambirix can be injected at Thrombozytopenie or blood disorders, as it can be injected in these cases after intramuscular gift.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix was administered in the second year in the form of a separate injection, tetanus-, azellular derision type b-vaccine (DTPa-IPV / Hib) or combined with a combined measur- mumps vaccine, the immune response to all antigens is sufficient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">Patients with immunomressive therapy or patients with immundefects must be assumed that no adequate immune response is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted using 3 vaccines of this formulation in adults, the frequency of pain, tube, swelling, weatheritis, headache and fever comparable to the frequency that was observed in the former Thiomersal- and preservative inhalation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical studies, 2029 vaccines of Ambirix were administered to a total of 1027 imprints at the age of 1 to 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study involving 300 participants at the age of 12 to including 15 years, the tolerability of Ambirix was compared to the 3-cans combined cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2753">The only exceptions were the higher Frequencies of pain and Matter on a calculation basis per vaccination dose Ambirix, but not on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the gift of Ambirix at 50.7% of the subjects compared with 39.1% of the subjects following the gift of a 3-cans combined dose.</seg>
<seg id="2755">According to the complete vaccination process, 66.4% of the subjects who had given Ambirix were vaccinated against pain, compared to 63.8% of the subjects who had been vaccinated with the 3-dose combination.</seg>
<seg id="2756">The frequency of Matter was however similar (i.e. above the entire vaccination cycle at 39.6% of the subjects who received Ambirix, compared with 36.2% of the subjects who received the 3-cans combination.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The prevalence of pain and pain was low and comparable to the combination of the combination of combination with the 3-cans vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1- 11-year-old impregnation, the occurrence of local reactions and general actions in the Ambirixology was comparable to that with the 3-cans combined combination with 360 ELISA and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">However, during the 6- to 11- year-old, however, vaccination with ambirix had a frequency of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not per protape.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The proportion of impregnation causing severe side effects during the 2 doses of vaccines with ambirix or during the 3 doses of vaccines with 360 ELISA- units formalinactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinantine Hepatitis B Surface antigen, was not different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials, which were carried out at imflow at the age of 1 to including 15 years, were the sercontingent rates for anti-HAV 99.1% one month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second, to month 6 (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The seropoversation rates for anti-HBS were 74.2% one month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second, to month 6 (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study conducted in 12- to including 15-year-old, 142 two cans of Ambirix and 147 were given the standard combination with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 people whose immunity was impaired, the serum (SP in the table below) were significantly higher compared to hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6, according to the gift of the 3-dose impurities significantly higher than with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immunity, which were achieved in a clinical study of 1- 11-year-olds one month after the completion of the full vaccination series (i.e. in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, the imburners were either a 2-cans vaccines with ambirix or a 3-cans vaccination with a combination of 360 ELISA and 10µg recombinantine Hepatitis B Surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In persons who were aged between 12 and 15 years old, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after immunisation with ambirix in the 0-6 months vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immunodeficiency reaction against both antigens was comparable to vaccination of 3 doses with a combination-simulation, consisting of 360 ELISA units formalinactivated Hepatitis- A-virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study on 12- to including 15-year-old, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies are shown 24 months after immunisation in the 0-6 months vaccine is comparable to the vaccination of 0-12 months.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of Ambirix was used in the second year of a combined dipher, tetanus-, azellular poliomyelitis- and 8 Haemophilus, inactivated poliomyelitis (DTPa-IPV / Hib) or the first dose of a combined measles mumps vaccine, the immune response was sufficient on all antigens.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults showed a similar formulation of similar games and seroprotational rates as for former formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is available both before and after resusencode at any external partial particles and / or physical visible alterations.</seg>

<seg id="2778">You can feel very tired, have a dark urine, bluish face, yellow skin and / or eyes (yellowing) and other symptoms that may not make a stationary treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix can not protect themselves completely from an infection with hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus, even if the complete vaccination series with 2 doses has been completed.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you are infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus before the administration of both vaccines, Ambirix is already infected with hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus (though you feel not unwell or sick / feels) a vaccine may not prevent disease.</seg>
<seg id="2781">A protection against other infections which may cause the liver or symptoms which are similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection that may not be conveyed.</seg>

<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction is expressed by juckering skin envelopes, breathing need or weaknesses of face or tongue. • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B. • If you have an allergic infection with a fever.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you want to have a protection against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and prior to the completion of the second vaccination dose).</seg>
<seg id="2785">With a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child of vaccination with ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, he will recommend you / your child 3 injections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced salary (360 ELISA units of a formalinactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant hepatitis B surface antigens).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective components is administered as a month after the first dose and should give you a vaccination protection before termination of the vaccination series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes Ambirix will suffer from people who suffer heavy blood disorders caused by the skin and not in the muscle is injected. • if you are weakened with a disease or treatment in your body's own defense / or if you / your child is underlined by a hemodialysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix can be given in these cases, but the immune response of these individuals can not be sufficient so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the reaction is on to vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Tell your doctor if you can take another medicine / pound (including those who have been vaccinated without disruptions) or if you have been given without disruptions / or received Immunoglobuline (antibodies) or that is planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">But it can be that in this case the immune response is not sufficient for the vaccine, and the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine must be given simultaneously with Ambirix, should be vaccinated with separate places and as possible as possible different limbs.</seg>
<seg id="2793">When Ambirix ought to be given the same time or shortly before or after injection of Immunoglobulines, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Usually, Ambirix pregnant or lactating women are not administered, except it is urgently needed to be vaccinated against hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B.</seg>
<seg id="2795">Important information about certain other components of Ambirix Please inform your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Neomycin (antibiotic).</seg>

<seg id="2805">Based on the data provided by the approval of the first approval for the entry level, the CHMP maintained the view that the benefit-risk ratio for Ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, since Ambirix was only used in a Member State in the Netherlands since May 2003, the available security data for this product is limited due to small patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonites can also be used in the age of over a month with a complete enzymes or hyperammonoptically Encephalopathy (brain damage caused by high ammony concentrations) in the pre-history.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonites is divided into several single doses to meals - split, under the food, or via a gastric acid (through the abdominal wall in the stomach-leading tube) or a noblonde (through the nose into the stomach leading tube).</seg>

<seg id="2817">According to the previous clinical experience, the usual daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat is: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with body weight over 20 kg as well as for adults and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients who suffer from an early solid lack of carbamylphosphate, or Ornithintranskribamylase, the substitution of Citirlin or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with an Argininosuccinate synthetic deficiency must receive arginine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets are not given to patients with swallowing disorders, as a risk for the emergence of ovagophagulcera exists if the tablets do not get in the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, equivalent to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g. of sodium polyphenylbutyal, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be used in patients with congestive heart failure or severe cardiac insufficiency, as well as with sodium reatric cancer cells only with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2823">As metabolic and deposition of sodium phenylbutyrat over the liver and the kidneys, AMMONAPS should be applied to patients with liver or kidney failure only with external caution.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contra-indexed (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">At subcutaneous administration of phenylacate at young rats in high dosage (190 - 474 mg / kg), it came to a slowdown of neuronal multiplication and increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">It also found a delayed maturation of cerebrals synapses and a reduced number of functional nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of the brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be determined that phenylactic of humans are exdivorced in breast milk, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS will be conindexed during a nursing time (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, 56% of patients were at least one undesirable event (AE) and 78% of these adverse events were assumed that they did not stand with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very often (≥ 1 / 10), often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by a 18-year-old anointing patient who developed a metabolic endothelia, severe mortkalemia, peripheral neuropathy, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of an overdose occurred within a 5 months old baby-child with an accidental individual dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms start with the Accumulation of phenylacacetate, which showed an intravenous neural toxicity aticity at an intravenous administration of up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylactic acetate is a metabolic active compound, conjugated by acetate with glutamine with phenylacetylglutamine using the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Stöchiometrically, phenylacetylglutamine is comparable with urea (both connections contained 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the loss of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disruptions of the urine cycle can be assumed that every gram included sodium polyphenylbutyal between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is of importance that the diagnosis is early and the treatment is started immediately in order to improve survival and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early symptoms of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in newborns was earlier almost always infist, and the disease caused by treatment with peritonealdialysis and essential amino acid or with their sticked analoga within the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By hematalysis, utilisation of alternative ways of nitrous oxide (sodium polyphenylacyate), proteinreduced food and possibly substitution of essential amino acids, it was possible to increase the survival rate as recently as postpartal (however within the first lifetime) cases to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and the survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients it came with many for mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a delayed shape of the disease (including female patients with heterozygintranscrubylase deficienase) that were treated from a hyperammonial Encephalopathy and subsequently treated with sodium phenylbutyrat and a proteinreduced diet was the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficiencies are hardly reversible in treatment and in some cases a further deterioration of the neurological state zone can occur in some patients.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrat is oxidized to phenol, which is conjugated in liver and kidney enzymatic with glutamine, whereby phenylacetylglutamine is formed.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its metabolism were determined according to the gift of a single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in an empty healthy adult and in patients with liver cirrhosis as well as repetitive gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (uncontrolled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrat and its Metabolite was also examined with cancer patients after intravenous administration of sodium phenylbutyrat (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylactic.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After a oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyal in tablet form, 15 minutes after intake measured plasma concentration of phenylbutyrat were detected.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with ureic cycles or hemogloopathic acid was detectable according to different doses of phenylbutyrat (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) in a plasma.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three of six patients with cirrhosis of liver cirrhosis, which were treated with sodium phenylbutyrat (20 g / day oral in three single doses), the mean phenylacetate concentrations in plasma concentration were five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">This medication is divorced within 24 hours to about 80-100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylglutamine over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of the Micronucleus tests, sodium phenylbutyrat had no sound effects (examination 24 and 48 h after oral dosing of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS granules is absorbed by either oral (infants and children who cannot allow tablets any tablets, or patients with swallowing disorders) or via a gastric acid or a noblonde.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to the previous clinical experience, the usual daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with bodywork of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with body weight over 20 kg as well as for adults and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in plasma should be held within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">In patients who suffer from an early solid lack of carbamylphosphate, or Ornithintranskribamylase, the substitution of Citirlin or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS granulate contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram sodium polyphenylbutyrate, equivalent to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium polyphenylbutyal, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rat flutes were exposed to the birth of phenylactic (active metabolite of phenylbutyrat), it came to lesions in the pyramidal cells of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by a 18-year-old anointing patient who developed a metabolic endothelia, severe mortkalemia, peripheral neuropathy, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Stöchiometrically, phenylacetylglutamine is comparable with urea (both connections contained 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the loss of excess</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of investigations about the deposition of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disturbances of the urine cycle can be assumed that every gram included the sodium polyphenylbutyal between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficiencies are hardly reversible in treatment, and in some cases a further deterioration of the neurological state zone can occur in some patients.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After a oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyal in granulatform, 15 minutes after intake measured plasma concentration of phenylbutyrat were detected.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the period of durability, the patient can temporarily store the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">In this case, the small measuring spoon contains 0.95 g, the average measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon of 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient needs to receive the medicine more than a probe, AMMONAPS can be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrat is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver enzymes, so that they could not leave the sticked waste products, which are not able to excrete themselves after consumption of proteins in the body.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If you have conducted laboratory studies, you need to inform the doctor that you may alter AMMONAPS, because sodium phenylbutyal may affect the results of certain laboratory studies.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is applied to the treatment of adult patients with "acute coronary syndromes" (ACS, reduced blood pressure on the heart), for example with unstable Angina (a form of pain in chest strap with different strength) or myocardial infarction (cardiac measurement value at the electrocardiac or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If anaox is used to prevent blood clots in patients, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can contribute to patients with Angina or heart failure to contribute to the heart and enhance the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study about the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of Angiox in sole gift or in connection with a glycoprotein IIb / IIIa-inhibitor (GPI, another drug to prevent blood clots) with a standard combination treatment with Heparin (another anticoagulans) and a GPI was compared.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI, the patients often remains a stent (a short tube that remains in the arteries to prevent a lock), and they received other medicines to prevent blood clots, such as ciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">At the treatment of ACS, Angiox - with or without a gift of GPI was used in the prevention of new events (deaths, cardiac attacks or Revascularisation) after 30 days or a year a total of as effective as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients receiving a PCI was angiox regarding all the indicators as well as Heparin, except for severe bleeding, among which it was much more effective than Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Anaox can not be applied in patients who may possibly oversensitive (allergic) against bivalirudine, other miludine or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It must not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding, as well as people with strong hypertension or severe kidney problems or cardiac infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Humanities (CHMP) reached the conclusion that Angiox is an immediate replacement for heparin during the treatment of ACS and a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission granted approval to the company The Medicines Company UK Ltd. a permit for placing inox in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndromes (unstable Angina / Non- ST-Hebrides (IA / NSTEMI)), when an early intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg, followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If the patient is carried out in another one, an additional Bolus of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the intervention is increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to clinical requirements, the reduced infusians dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately before the procedure, a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg was administered, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of Angiox in patients with one PCI consists of an initial intravenous bolt of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and one of them directly subsequent intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of a single Bolus-gift of Angiox has not been investigated and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to under 225 seconds, a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / bodyweight is required.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted drug should be carefully mixed before use and the bolt dose rapidly administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">As soon as the ACT amounts to more than 225 seconds, a further monitor is no longer required, provided, the 1.75 mg / kg infusians dose is given right.</seg>
<seg id="2900">A lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be applied in patients with medium-severe kidney cancer (GFR 30-59 ml / min), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT value is less than 225 seconds, a second bolt dose is 0.3 mg / kg and it is necessary to test the ACT 5 minutes after the second half dose.</seg>

<seg id="2906">In combination with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, patients are administered to any other anticoagulant in combination with any other anticoagulans (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if PCI patients occur among Bivalirudin most bleeding an arterial points of bleeding, in patients suffering from a cutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), while the treatment principle occur anywhere.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients receiving warfarin and treated with Bivalirudin, a monitoring of INR value (International standardization ratio) should be removed in order to ensure that the value of treatment with bivalirudin once again reached the level before the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge about the action of anticoagulants (Heparin, Warfarin, Thrombolytics or Thrombolic aggregationshemmer) can be assumed that these substances increase blood disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In combination of Bivalirudin with Thrombozytenders or anticoagulants, the clinical and biological hemogasepic parameters are regularly monitored in any case.</seg>

<seg id="2923">Angiox contains bivalirudin, a direct and specific thrombinocor, which binds to both catalytic and anionic region of Thrombin, irrespective of whether thrombs is bound in the liquid phase or to Gerinnsel.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of Bivalirudin on Thrombin, and with its effect, is reversible, because Thrombin is unobsolete, because Thrombin regenerates the binding of Bivalirudin-Arg3-Pro4, thereby regenerates the function of the active centre of thrombine.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, by bivalirudin patients with serum from patients who had come to heparininduced Throbozytopenia / heparininduced Throid syndrome (HIT / HITTS), no Thromboocytes reaction reaction was induced.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy subjects and patients, Bivalirudin shows a dossier and concentration-dependent anticoagulatory effect that is occupied by the prolongation of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If the patient was carried out below a PCI, an additional Bolus of 0.5mg / kg Bivalirudin should be increased and the infusion for the duration of the intervention is increased to 1,75mg / kg / h.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is applied to the treatment of adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes that require treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is given subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the upper leg or the upper arm, or as a continuous use of an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease where the body does not provide sufficient insulin on the control of Glucosespiegels (sugar) in the blood or process insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin-insulin distinguishes itself very slightly from human insulin, and the change means that it works faster and a shorter work duration than a short-effective humankind.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was used in the application in combination with a long-effective insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the body was not able to produce in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study involving 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes, in which the body insulin is not effective, Apidra was studied in a study with 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indian for the efficacy was the change in substance glycoylized hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that shows how good the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes, a decrease of 0.14% (from 7,60% to 7.46%) compared with a reduction of 0.14% at insulin-lisper.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the reduction in HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% of human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra must not be used in patients who are possibly oversensitive (allergic) against insulin-insulin or one of the other components, or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The cans of Apidra must possibly be adjusted when it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood of the blood.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH granted approval for the placing of Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is used as subcutaneous injection either in the area of abdominal ceiling, to apply or subcutaneous injection into the field of abdominal subcutaneous injection.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced Gluconogenesis capacity and diminated insulin changes, insulin needs to be lowered with a limitation of the liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change in action strength, the brand (cardiac), insulin delays, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the production method can draw a change in insulin demand.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 A inadequate dosing or termination of a treatment, especially in patients with an insulable diabetes, may lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoazig; these states are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The changeover of a patient to another insulin type or insulin should be done with strict medical supervision, and can change a change in dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The onset of a hypoglycaemia depends on the effect profile of the insulin and can therefore change over the changeover of the treatment schemas.</seg>
<seg id="2983">To strengthen the substances that enhance blood glucose concentrations, include oral antidiabetic, angiopathy, fibrosis, fluorescence, fibrate, fluoroamin-oxidant (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, propoxyphen, salizylates and sulphur antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the effect of sympatholytics, like betwidowns, Clonidin, Guanethidine, and Reserve the symptoms of adsorcervical to be shout or missing.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimental studies for reproductive tools showed no differences between Insu- linglulisin and Humanities in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin pooisines overoccurs in human breast milk, but in general, insulin does not occur in breast milk, nor is resorded according to oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">The following are known from clinical trials, grouped according to system organic classes and, according to the incidence of their record (very often: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; rarely: ≥ 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10.000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10.000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10; very rare:</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold -silence, cool, and bleeding skin, fatigue, nervousness or brooks, anxiety, unusual experience or weakness, dizziness, excessive Hunting, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy Is vails to continuously change the injection of injection within the injection area, as a result of a lipodystrophy on the injection station.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Heavy hypoglycemias with consciousness can be given by a intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of Glucose (0.5 to 1 mg), which is given by a doctor correspondingly, or by intravenous gift of glucose through a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a glucose injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of serious mortglycaemia and avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose (especially through skeletal musculature and fat) as well as inhibiting of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at subcutaneous Gac of insulin injulite occurs faster and the duration is shorter than in hu- manem normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study involving 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes melli- tus showed insulin-relevant dosing range of 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg, a proportional counter-effective effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a proportional increase of the combined effect, just like humankind.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin-lulisin has a twice as fast efficiencies as normal human-insulin and achieves the complete gluing force of approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">The data was evident from an application of insulin-lulisin 2 minutes before meal a comparable postpacidial glycemic control is achieved as with human normal insulin that is given 30 minutes before meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The insulin-lulisin 2 minutes before meal was passed, a better postpacidial control was achieved as with human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin is turned uptake 15 minutes after the meal, a comparable glycemic control as with human normal insulin, which is given 2 tends before meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin delivery in gift for 2 minutes before the beginning of the meal compared to human normal insulin, the 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min.) before the beginning of the meal was given (Figure 1A) and compared to human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin delivery in 15 minutes (GLULISIN: after the beginning of the meal compared to human nor- malinsulin, the 2 minutes (NORMAL - previously) before the beginning of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
