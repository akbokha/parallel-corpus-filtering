the pec@@ uli@@ arity of &amp; fs@@ view ; consists of a rectangle with the help of a so @-@ called Tree @-@ Map graph@@ ically . each object is proportional to its size , whose area is proportional to its size . this size must have the sum of the size of the sub@@ ordin@@ ate objects of an object smaller or equal to the size of the object .
in &amp; fs@@ view ; reflects the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of a folder as the sum of the size of entries is specified . consequently , you can easily be detected if they can be viewed below in the folder hier@@ archy , it can be viewed as a graphic and interactive version of &amp; UNIX ; command you can be considered .
in &amp; fs@@ view ; is an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap @-@ representation a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your file system . to simpler navigation possess the rec@@ tan@@ gles practical application and labelling settings .
the colour of a rectangle that is switched over to view of color mode , may either display depth for easy detection of the appearance and figure of other file names like name , propriet@@ or , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rectangle may be lab@@ eled with the various properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each feature you can determine if it is at all , only if sufficient space is present or if the area may occur by limitations in the sign of the Tre@@ em@@ ap . in addition , you can set the relative position of the label in rectangle .
in point algorith@@ ms for tre@@ ads , the surface is proportional to the size of the entry . in the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; fs@@ view ; this goal is not always drawn to the dis@@ closure of entries , and these frames require space , which is then lost to the sub@@ ordin@@ ate entries . note that less space is lost for the frame , if the rectangle is square .
as the distribution of an entry for the sub@@ ordin@@ ate entries will remain , the implementation will be over@@ priced . here it is for the label and to prevent the surfaces such as possible , which are possible to square , which are possible to square . the best methods are shown in lines , columns or rec@@ ep@@ tive parent .
you can set the minimal presented area for an entry in the menu entry to the area . instead , a cat@@ ching pattern is drawn into the area of the above entry , to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an or@@ derly entry .

although &amp; digi@@ plug is ; easy to use , it is complete cleaning professional abilities . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion by li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG @-@ export and ICC @-@ color @-@ administered workflow .
improved database with much more met@@ ad@@ ata as well as &amp; eg ; on the camera or the lens can be sought .
like all &amp; k@@ art ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ plug ; an open source project . that means , it is focused on support of the En@@ dan@@ wen@@ der . they should therefore report problems and improvement possibilities .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; try to make the mel@@ ody of problems or suggestions so easy as possible . if you are always in the program , the help menu includes a dialog with a interrup@@ ting lin@@ king . if you use these short@@ cuts , your web browser opens a page in error correction system . all required information can be registered here . follow the instructions to send your report .
&amp; digi@@ plug , is a project supported by a community . if you come to other users from &amp; digi@@ plug , then we would like to answer any other users of &amp; digi@@ plug , and hop@@ efully we would like to answer any questions of other users . however , this mail@@ ing@@ list is definitely spoken in English , you should therefore be mighty in this language .
you can also take the digi@@ plug ; homepage to see News about free @-@ released versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ plug ; to find out .
the best start to participate in &amp; digi@@ plug , is the registration in the developer mail@@ ing@@ list . guide to sign up in the developers mail@@ ing@@ list from &amp; digi@@ plug ; .
if you come &amp; digi@@ plug ; for the first time , you will be asked where you want to save your pictures and your database . enter the file name here or click the folder icon file to select a folder .
in the second field you have to specify a local folder on your computer . here , data ab@@ n@@ k will be stored . this path remains the same for all image folders .
later you can add so many folders as you want to add . &amp; digi@@ plug , you will additionally use as Al@@ ben@@ library . add settings and digi@@ ous collections
if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top file that contains images as base folder . &amp; digi@@ plug , viewed any sub @-@ folder as album . no image will be changed . during the search of the folder you get a progress indicator as this :
&amp; digi@@ plug ; dur@@ y@@ ages re@@ leg@@ sive the library f@@ ad in its whole depth . you can &apos;t let any sub @-@ folder , unless it is in a hidden folder . this allows you to take an ins@@ om@@ bs &amp; digi@@ plug , do by making a point in front of the name of the folder .
if you have a existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ list contains no more photos than symbols . you can remove any photo taken from the album and select this on the folder icon . further details can be found in the section albums .
once you have configured the base folder you can setup and take your digital camera . after this , you should learn how to use My albums and My Key@@ word box to manage your photos into the albums .

how to configure this and work with raw material files are described in sections of Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ settings and Ro@@ h tasks .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera line will be provided you can connect to your digital camera and support your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ plug ; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library . of course each medium and each card reader is supported by your operating system , with &amp; digi@@ plug .
modern digital cameras are designed to be transmitted via the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IEEE @-@ 1394 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera will then be realized as a record engine . the camera can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras use the connection to serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ plug , uses the program g@@ Phot@@ o@@ 2 to communication with digital cameras , which has been developed an increasing number of more than 800 cameras . g@@ Phot@@ o@@ 2 also supports the transfer protocol designed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to machines and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need additional driver .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the calcul@@ ator . since photos in general large files are slow and transmission via the serial port , this connection is meanwhile out@@ dated . &amp; digi@@ plug , supports these cameras and leads the transmission of images with g@@ Phot@@ o@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ no 2 has to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support , so that the EX@@ IF support will not be read from some lib@@ complex 2 camera channels . if the EX@@ IF support is not available in lib@@ g@@ owns 2 , you will be able to show anything larger or the production could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things in &amp; digi@@ plug , is how easy to expand its functionality by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image plug@@ ins interface Project ( manual ) is a approach to develop a joint module structure for &amp; digi@@ plug ; , K@@ Phot@@ o@@ album , Sho@@ wi@@ gs and g@@ wen@@ view . aim is to provide memory modules for all the graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manip@@ ulate images in virtually any way as there is also a user . your advantage is that it is much easier , &amp; digi@@ plug ; by writing a little module to complement one function , when the changes in &amp; digi@@ plug is done .
to simpli@@ fy the window , you can either remove the side@@ bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or change in full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F .

what is a digital state administration - away from the fashion word ? digital data management considers any part of the process after the image has been taken until the final issue and the permanent storage . each of the photos takes up , sc@@ anned or digital photos stores a form of digital evaluation . but most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips like you can back up , find , protecting and photos again . we look at the process for digital photography the &amp; digi@@ plug . we look at the process for downloading , remove , batch , group@@ ed , archi@@ ving , wait , wait , wait and export image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital stock office occupies , inde@@ xed , categorized , sec@@ tioning , trans@@ forming and exported contents that have a mon@@ et@@ ar or cultural value . quot ;
met@@ ad@@ ata is defined as data on data . met@@ ad@@ ata are provided according to your definition data , information about or documentation of other data provided by an application or environment .
I d@@ are to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you will not need to find a specific photo . if you don &apos;t want to know how many photos you have , then you will not use &amp; digi@@ plug , then you will not use &amp; digi@@ plug in a database as well as in the image files which you can easily access to other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you do and know what you need to do something in your system is the structure information structure unlike your computer . you need to decide whether you want to save it on a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc ; make sure you need to change at some bigger drive .
perhaps you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly over your location . the remaining photos will be arranged on the same place . if you have enough photos , then you will use sub @-@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . you can then print a folder for images that you print or on a website .
professional photograph@@ ers have other requirements such as ver@@ sion@@ ing photos , archi@@ ving , working process , constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of images . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % work files and you will not want to re@@ organise your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the pile processing easier . separate new of old files .
the separation of original and work@@ files simpli@@ fies the backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are searching for an original or an derived image .
we also recommend the met@@ ad@@ ata to store the met@@ ad@@ ata at the time of the met@@ ad@@ ata in &amp; digi@@ plug . if you forget that Ex@@ i@@ f@@ - and IP@@ TC data can be written into the file , then you can easily save the met@@ ad@@ ata from the database into the files by clicking the corresponding item in the menu album .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what you want ? to give them a met@@ ad@@ ata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are the main features of course .
well , the real work begins , since you should now choose all images that you want to select every photo . of course you can choose all photos that the same attri@@ bute need to select and then set the value . this makes sense , since you can concentrate on the best photos in further work .
let &apos;s go to us with key@@ words , keywords , as you are often called with other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you want to import catal@@ og@@ ized pictures from another source with embedded locations , then it will build the tree for you or put the images on the right spot . the changes of the hier@@ archy is no problem and can simply be done by removing a sub @-@ tree to another . the changed keywords will be pursued by &amp; digi@@ plug ; updated while the sub @-@ trees are persecuted .
the graphic shows how different met@@ ad@@ ata is cut out . this is a very rough representation , since each block of met@@ ad@@ ata in truth consists of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all pictures .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to labels or comments , the third major tool to catal@@ og@@ ate your met@@ ad@@ ata .
they want to see most of your photos simply only , they want to share them with your friends , your family , other photograph@@ ers and agencies . they are sure to be interested in your photos .
check out this panorama . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you consider closer look , then catch some details , people , the place .
and now I tell you this the landing area of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Norman@@ die 60 years after landing . Wow ! one starts to dream , associations , the historical period is again present , you may perhaps even hear the silence . the label has changed your perception of this panorama .
for other photos consider the title may be more important than the image itself to create a story . remember that the key is to help you to transfer it to Him as the motive has the opportunity to understand what you understand .
it is okay if a picture is not perfect when it has the strength only with a label for himself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ plug , you can also save a lot of text , in an international@@ ised alp@@ habet ( UTF @-@ 8 ) , then you can use it for a selection of images at the same time . K@@ DE will also give you a sp@@ elling tests according to your wishes into the label and / or the title of the web gallery system . you have to tell the story therefore for a second time .
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find in another city without navigation system ? was it not a bor@@ ing planet before goo@@ gle Earth ? well , because with images the train of the spatial presentation now has been running now with light speed .
the possibilities can increase the ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ alization . I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat the photos at the reception place . you can also read the photos at the reception place . you can also find the photos at the reception place . you can also export the images to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc . using Google Earth viewer .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and signi@@ fies the practice of cop@@ y@@ rights to remove limitations across the distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms are also applicable in all changed versions , so also for working other .
the following description will tell you what information in the setup site of &amp; digi@@ plug is :
author ( syn@@ onym for replacement and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the photographer , for example to use the name of the photographer , then the name of a company or organisation will not be changed . after that of this value , it should not be changed , but this field does not support Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ ons as a separ@@ ator .
aut@@ os@@ itel ( syn@@ onymous with author ) : associated with the author . this field contains the working name of the photographer . examples may be the title like : employee photographer , Free photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a note to the author field , this must be filled out too .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the view box to identify who is the photo . if the photographer has been listed here , you can &apos;t necessarily plan the image . if the picture is a stock photo , then the group / agency will then offer the image here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they have no protection against abuse . everyone who has no protection against abuse . this is the solution for this problem is digital water@@ mark . for individuals , this is only very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique in the picture . &amp; digi@@ plug , in the near future , a module for st@@ acker processing is available .

of course we &apos;re not talking about CDs that went on the road or a fire . these kind of losses are the same which can also happen with traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section it concerns problems with the so @-@ called New Media .
K@@ roll On@@ track , the largest data recovery company in the world , has some interesting statistics which has a loss of data .
to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs , these must be treated for longer than a few years . of course , you can also keep your CDs and DVDs in archive quality , of course you can claim even more expensive and much more expensive . there are offers of gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 that can claim a lifetime of 100 years for themselves . if you believe that is in your nar@@ row@@ ning game .
CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable but you can use this risk in which you can use good disc@@ o and good recording equipment . the best DVD recording devices are not more expensive than the cheapest , but you &apos;re writing a lot more reliable . therefore it turns out to the right .
CDs and DVDs are very vulner@@ able for errors , even if you are just written only . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for form@@ att@@ ing and control sum@@ s . despite this massive protection , they use chemical anti@@ quities , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc .
for faul@@ ty CDs and DVDs , there is a reasonable program called I@@ so@@ B@@ uster . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux , but is still not available for Mac@@ s . there &apos;s also similar applications the damaged data of damaged disks , hard disks , Flash media , USB drive etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to save the format War against the HD DVD . a Dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a Dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . everything which has been spoken to CDs and DVDs is of course also for the Blu @-@ ray disc .
burn slowly with a good recording device to high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ etary format . also read the media with a description , date &amp; author label and afterwards protected on a clean , dark dry and before animals protected site . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before using the last piece of hardware or software that can read this media .
Disk@@ manufacturer keep your statistics for themselves . their manufacturer guarantees a new disk , but not the data . Google presents a large field study about the error mechanisms of hard drives : dis@@ mis@@ siles
shortly : Dis@@ ks will keep on the longest when you are operated in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. The most common error reading , SM@@ ART can not determine the im@@ pending failure . some of the SM@@ ART cannot be im@@ pending . these are particularly readers of reading and publishing counter . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete losses due to over@@ voltage . of course you can also have data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files , but these losses may normally produce without large problems .
while most electrical devices do not have a lot of power , this can take heavy damage with computer chips and high speed processes . these can cause severe damage , complete data loss , hard@@ board mother@@ boards , and other defects . protect themselves from in@@ ev@@ itable , causing it to a loss of time and money .
most common protection against electricity peaks is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs a part of energy heat absor@@ bs and the rest . it is usually possible in the form of a plug @-@ wall . remember that not any plug @-@ line also contains an over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should make sure that he meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . it guarantees a certain minimum to protection . you should also make sure that it protects against lightning bolt and thus protects the correctly connected devices .
as a over@@ voltage can use each cable to your computer , you should also make sure that all the periph@@ er@@ als can be connected to your system . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage support which also includes a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connectivity options for co@@ axial cable of the cable modems and the TV ticket .
if you have a not@@ ebook , then you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these tools are specially developed for not@@ eb@@ ooks and therefore also contain protection for the modem . so you are ideal for travelling .
while the over@@ voltage protection your system protects your system from smaller variations in the power lines it will not really help you . even a few seconds can lead to the loss of un@@ subst@@ it@@ able data . therefore , it may be meaning@@ ful to invest in an un@@ interrup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to protect against over@@ l@@ ash@@ ings , these devices can automatically be able to save your data . however , some models allow you to save your data . if you want a UPS , then you should be sure to keep the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the included software is interesting .
consider the potential risk to prevent your computer system and compare its security in current problems with the cost of avoi@@ ding these . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . this is just a small price difference if you think . at the end you should always remember all cables to tr@@ enne before you go into the holiday .
the Amazon Web service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - an easy storage service . using the right configuration you can use this as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to store this as a backup destination for your software . Google Sh@@ ared Storage is another popular offer that you can save any quantities of data .
however , they are very expensive compared to the hard drives at home very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 500 . furthermore , you have to send the data about the compar@@ atively slow Internet .
solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against local data loss of the most important images . it does not include a poor solution , but there is no general backup solution . it is therefore too slow .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are available on photos . the professional variant will not provide you with full resolution online . for 25 $ per year you get unlimited storage what should be reviewed in reality .
from the point of view of the data backup , web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically included with the TCP protocol and the large companies are included in the offer as a backup and secure memory .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer . all trans@@ missions are due for transmission errors . the file system requirements and b@@ tr@@ fs provide at least the data integrity between operating systems and hard disk .
the worst thing is that no one says when a transmission error occurred , not when it was done in your hardware . it is pretty wor@@ r@@ ying that there should be no protection in your computer . no one seems to have thought about it . the internet with its TCP protocol is a more safe data way than the in your computer .
un@@ reliable power parts are another source of transfer losses , as they generate inter@@ ferences within the data flow . under normal file system these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are currently not affected by transfers problems , you should see in the future . already 2010 you will see thousands of error per year .
Z@@ FS by Sun Mic@@ ros@@ ystems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle and highly scalable and is available . it is open source , with many patents and is available under one to the GPL in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for Linux and Windows . read this article in English .
Oracle has started its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem . it is still in alpha @-@ status . it uses the same protection mechanisms the z@@ fs and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate that these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data losses in not@@ ebook and 46 % with the job systems . if not@@ eb@@ ooks , the proportion of theft is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less widespread than the most memory . it leads to a lower damage , than for theft or new installations . and there is currently only a few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; so long no longer sigh@@ ted .
open source file systems are less sus@@ cep@@ tible to data loss as propri@@ etary systems : wrong , N@@ TF@@ S is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reis@@ er@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS in order to give the common file systems . a very good English article will be found here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process with sudden inter@@ ruption during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . if a file does not have been added before the problem is lost , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat for digital data : false , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aperture settings from fundamental physical limits . gener@@ t is that while the technology is further developed , there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and rough@@ k@@ characteristic for all kinds of light sensors are no longer removed from this border .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ apix@@ els sensors . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the final result is the optimum for compact cameras . even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ apix@@ els . for higher resolutions , you need a full format sensor ( 24x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
a 750@@ GB hard disk drive you today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not make another data loss for data loss . thus , you can secure your data often after a plan and test this backup before you do anything like the new installation of your operating system , the exchange of panels or the size change of hard drives .
suppose you make your back@@ ups on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , lightning strikes you , if the drive was not connected in the moment .
a disaster proposes locally and destroyed a lot . forget an aircraft accident : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect an entire room or the entire house .
hence , Des@@ ast@@ er@@ prevention is always a non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups to the neighbourhood , in your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as above mentioned is a more common reason for a data loss despite backup the pan@@ ic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files should be secured . it is a snap@@ shot without hist@@ ori@@ ans and represents a complete copy at a time .
differentiation backup : a backup of the files have been changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete moment@@ um of two time points : the complete backup and the last differentiation .
incre@@ mental backup : ensuring a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . it can produce the original status of any time . this securing comes to a ver@@ sion@@ ing system next with the exception that it is only ab@@ ated and not continuing .
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that can easily setup easily on your machines . in contrast to script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file trans@@ missions . this happens compressed , and if you want to increase safety over ss@@ h .
secure an important pictures directly after you have saved them on your computer on a DVD or another op@@ tically medium .
this approach can give you enough time to discover and restore losses . at the same time , you get a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly mom@@ entary for at least one month and a moment of mom@@ entary for each month . any further expansion should be manually after you have taken a complete review .
topics : met@@ ad@@ ata , stored in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original retain , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ locate images and met@@ ad@@ ata , copy the pictures to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , visual equipment , ...
thus valuable images will survive the next 40 year that is about the time that you are really interested in your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
since the future is un@@ fore@@ se@@ eable , you need to consider everything today . unfortunately , there is no other way to keep your watch over time . every 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask yourself as the current system back@@ wards compatible . if you have less variations in the past , all easier is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered with explanations in this document , so do you use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtualization today is now available for everyone . if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures , then store it up and install it in a virtual machine for a later use .
on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and Secure technology , or your file format , should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard . stay open @-@ open standards .
scal@@ ability is the expert pressure for the possibility to change a system in its size . it actually means to enlarge .
let us assume that you have completed the scal@@ ability with the set and the area you want to have a dedicated record or partition . with * nix systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and select the new record :
check the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new record has been detected , but do not hang them up .
&amp; dollar ; d@@ d if = / dev / S@@ DC # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the plate in MB@@ ER ; # works with ext@@ 2,3 , FAT@@ 16 , 32 and Reis@@ er@@ FS &amp; dollar ; resi@@ ze@@ 2@@ fs / dev / cor@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of Reis@@ er@@ FS if necessary
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no software more that can read it , then you can create this task . this task is easier by year to year .
GIF is a propri@@ etary format that dis@@ appears slowly from the market . it should therefore no longer be used .
PNG was to replace the GIF as an open source standard , but it can save much more . it &apos;s los@@ s@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC Met@@ ad@@ ata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . PNG is that there is relative many administration information , but not as many as TIFF needed and recommend a slow compression . this format we would like to recommend you to save your pictures .
TIFF was widely used as image format . it manages images in high quality , but requires very large files . with some cameras you can easily save your pictures in this format . however , there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The digital neg@@ atives file format is a licensed and open raw file format developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the amount of camera formats . it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is required to use met@@ ad@@ ata . a hand@@ ful Cam@@ ero@@ y manufacturer is now available and we hope to use the competitors from Canon and Nikon .
this may be one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology introduced to replace the &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ ad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a characteristic technology that allows users to create &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photograph@@ ers attract it before the original of your photo , mostly in raw format , to view it . X@@ MP fits them to problems with the link between the met@@ ad@@ at@@ end@@ at@@ ei and the image file , and so you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and place everything there .
the Dublin Core Met@@ ad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization that support for fully compatible Online met@@ ad@@ ata standards . to the activities of D@@ C@@ MI , the work on architecture and modelling activities , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and trans@@ mitting efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of met@@ ad@@ ata standards and practices .
import images of the camera , the card reader or the scanner . so long the pictures are on the camera &apos;s camera you can use it as temporary f@@ use .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your blan@@ ket . this function is not implemented yet .
for a sensitive work you can use external programs . if you come back with &amp; digi@@ plug , then you should add the met@@ ad@@ ata again . these were cut under circumstances from other programs .
protect the produced images for the copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them only in Web@@ gal@@ eries , code to MPEG , use in contact page , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ plug . in the section add a photos to an album , you can add photos that you already have already on your hard drive , but the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for import@@ ing images to your album bank .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug , connect this with the computer , switching the camera to the display mode and switch it on . another description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , try to connect to your camera . if the connection is made , a distance indicator at the bottom ends and the images of all photos on the camera will be displayed . some cameras do not represent such images . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ames and a symbol of file rules for each file , photos , movies , music etc .
before you can download the photos on your computer , you might need the camera information about any entry . using the side@@ bars properties and met@@ ad@@ ata from the camera interface , you can see the characteristics of an entry or a met@@ ad@@ ata .
this dialog displays file characteristics and the photo information that can be stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded on your computer . note that some digital cameras are not available .
the rider Met@@ ad@@ ata shows the internal met@@ ad@@ ata as EX@@ IF , manufacturer note , GPS etc. of the image . these information are the same as in the met@@ ad@@ ata page from the main window of &amp; digi@@ plug ; or the im@@ aging . note that these met@@ ad@@ ata are not available on some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button Download and then download the photos from their camera into a single album in &amp; digi@@ plug , and we recommend you to check if the pictures have been downloaded in a album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can only select the desired option from &amp; k@@ de ; when you selected the photos , use the button . download the button Selected , until you selected some photos .
if your camera supports this is a new option . these pictures have been released until now not from &amp; digi@@ plug . in this case , the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window . if you select this option , of course the new pictures will be downloaded .
if you can download or download the buttons , you will find a dialog where you can select the target album , displayed in the photos . the list of existing albums are sorted according to normal folders . select the target album from the list and press OK .
after which you have selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ plug , the photos from the camera takes you into the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all at once , by using the button delete all . if you want to delete a button , then you need to select this first and remove from the Del@@ ete Line .
please note that there is no possibility to recover photos that have been deleted from the camera . you should not check out whether the photos were successfully deleted from the camera . if you want to delete the camera , you should make sure that you want to make this camera by camera , as it is much faster .
cameras use as fil@@ en@@ ames often not especially meaning@@ ful names . the fil@@ en@@ ames are usually used again after having taken photos of the camera . this can be sen@@ sible , the date and time to integrate the picture , in which the image has been made to integrate into the fil@@ en@@ ame .
in the next section you will find options for turning and mirrors of the image and for data @-@ based sub@@ ver@@ bs . if you use this latter option , you will automatically create a folder a day .
the options During the transfer opens three further options , which are done before the photos are stored on the disk . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the EX@@ IF information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct the date and time for all downloaded images .
if you wish another date format than the default format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % S . turn this option to add date and time . for further adaptations , you should read the help of the command .
if you use the camera file names , you have the option to change the file names in small case letters or if you prefer this .
the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; digi@@ plug ; for a photo , is displayed beneath the name , showing the camera in preview . their settings are stored and automatically used when you open the next time for the next time .
&amp; digi@@ plug , you can use all information about the orientation of the camera to perform an automatic rotation during shut@@ down . not all cameras make this information . in the section side@@ bar Met@@ ad@@ ata , you can read more details about the information that your camera embedded in the photo .
automatic rotation is usually switched on , and when your camera is not supplied , and digi@@ plug , the photo in the original orientation . if you want to switch off automatic rotation , use the button extension and select the Automatic rotation in the lower range of the window .
if your camera has been made on the picture , in which the photo was made , you can use &amp; digi@@ plug . all the images with the same date are loaded into the same sub@@ album . not all cameras make this information available . in Section side@@ bar Meta Data , you can consult the photos embedded in the photos .
this option is normally switched off , and in this case , &amp; digi@@ plug , the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this option , you will need to switch this option , and select the option file @-@ based sub @-@ based sub @-@ based sub@@ folders at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to download photos from their computer to your camera is the button . then choose the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files that are up@@ loaded . you can also select more than a file with the Standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , asks &amp; digi@@ plug , where the images will be loaded up . choose a folder selection dialog for the camera . choose the desired folder and press OK to start the upload file . the images are not deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Positi@@ oning System ) is used as a general concept that is specified in length and lat@@ itude , which can be displayed on a map . the identification of data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European Galileo or any other system .
not only for professional photograph@@ ers it can make it interesting a picture with a precise ge@@ ographic site . not everyone uses a plane to sing an area through automatic recording of GPS data . environmental plann@@ er , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you forgot exactly the photo , you can open a browser that shows the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ plug , users want to document the place of the photos , or just to document this aspect , it is good to transmit the position data of a photo .
the question is how to get the GPS data into the image ? first , you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 does not support many GPS data fields , such as the data in these fields ? there are at least three ways to reach this . right with the right hardware , via an editing of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module to the geographical mapping ( manual ) and last about the manual input of well known places .
as far as we know , there are currently no camera which has a GPS unit . but there is a few that work with GPS receivers . either as map module or transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye iP@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ dak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ric@@ oh Pro G3 Sony
downloading of GPS data from one device can store with g@@ p@@ sman or g@@ p@@ sb@@ abel , but they must store these data in the GP@@ X format , since this is the only format supported by the ge@@ ographic mapping module .
there are different programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract data from images and from GPS . on the following page you can make the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ p@@ s@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ p@@ s@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and lat@@ itude or other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the signs @-@ contained coordinates that can be created by m@@ ap@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
m@@ ap@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European road maps . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ plug , tries to give you as much control over his work@@ flows as possible . in order to access these settings , you must select between the settings of the digi@@ plug , set up in eight pages . you can switch between these settings and click on the icons of the left @-@ hand side .
you can select action on b@@ aked preview or start image processing . set the standard behaviour of &amp; digi@@ plug ; proof , if you click on an entry in the main screen .
this page contains , as shown below , the stand@@ did@@ acy and data @-@ legal data . this data will automatically be selected automatically in the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields , if the option is written for download from the camera line . also on a database synchron@@ ization these data are written into the IP@@ TC fields .
Aut@@ ort@@ itel is a syn@@ onym for disc@@ asser@@ ting parts : this field should contain the professional name of the photographer . this can be worn as a photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a further description to the authority , this must be filled also .
editor is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to view the photo . this must not be the author , if this is written for a news agency , such as Reuters or Associated Press , then these organizations should be listed here , then the group or agency will be the image below .
the IP@@ TC promotions save data into the corresponding IP@@ TC wheel . this ensures that the met@@ ad@@ ata must permanently contain in the picture and are not only available in the database of &amp; digi@@ plug ; these met@@ ad@@ ata are also available , and can be imported without being lost without being lost .
shots as embedded as embedded labels ( J@@ F@@ IF ) in JPEG pictures : this synchron@@ izes the comments that you can read to your photos , with the images included in the images . attention : for images that already contain labels , these are over@@ written by the &amp; digi@@ plug .
the page settings contains all options for the information that appear when the mouse poin@@ ter can be displayed in the main window over a file . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ plug ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to determine which file types &amp; digi@@ plug , you can add the file extensions of this list . Alb@@ um@@ folder , which has no such extensions , igno@@ red by &amp; digi@@ plug ; igno@@ red .
the default settings can be reset again by pressing the button on the right of each category .
the settings of the lighthouse &amp; digi@@ plug could be set on this page . however , some pictures have different sizes and synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . the option &amp; quot ; In all image size lad@@ en@@ quot ; you should only receive on fast computers . if you have one , then you can receive better visibility results .
by default , the picture processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can choose this tool@@ bar if you use the image processing in full screen mode .
over@@ exposed areas of a picture can be marked with dark or brigh@@ ter colour in the picture . these colors are set here . in the image processing , this picture can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma Sub@@ sampling , the images in higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance is encoded as in the colour connections . please read this article in Wikipedia for the full explanation .
with the adjustment of PNG compression , you can &apos;t reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not need the image quality , since PNG is a reliable algorithm . if you have a fast calcul@@ ator , you can set this value to a high compression . that means 1 : a low and 9 high compression .
with the add @-@ to @-@ files you can switch the de@@ fl@@ ate algorithm for TIFF pictures . this reduces the size of the TIFF images . it does not affect the image quality because the de@@ fl@@ ate algorithm has no loss .
with the adjustment of loss free JPEG 2000 files you can save loss free . even if you have written the loss of loss , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than in the normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , Met@@ ad@@ ata was not yet supported , but was in planning .
in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ plug , the picture processing was just a viewer for photos . currently , it develops very fast to a tool for manip@@ ulating your photos . with this dialog , you can change the settings of the image processing .
the standard deviation is that all green pixels are equal to ultra@@ violet light . if you use this option to ultra@@ violet light , this option shows a bit soft , elim@@ in@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 ring patterns with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white equal to the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the Automatic color balance is used .
this setting is used only if the white equal is not set . standard is it a fixed color balance , which was photographed on a white card which was photographed in the sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SLR cameras . the use of the second sensors has the effect that exposed images in four steps more details in the top . for other cameras this option is igno@@ red .
the standard is the top light , so the parts of your images are the top @-@ to @-@ view , because of the ability of your camera to view the top white in the settings . the setting colors are generated by some unusual results as they show the top @-@ light in various Ros@@ at@@ ö@@ nen . last@@ ly , you can try to re@@ constru@@ ct some parts of the missing information from the top @-@ lights .
this is possible because blue pixels in general is not so fast as fast as green and red . &amp; d@@ c@@ w try therefore to re@@ constru@@ ct the missing green and red @-@ shares from the still not saturated blue pixels . of course this is a question , how much color or white you want .
if you select the option , select the option to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and can thus be adjusted individually for each image .
set the L@@ umin@@ ous value according to your taste . you probably have to set him a bit higher than the default 1 . this may also be made later in the educational options of the &amp; digi@@ plug , in order to keep the time for Dem@@ os@@ a@@ tone small , you should be con@@ serv@@ atively .
a demo process is a digital im@@ print process , in order to calculate a complete picture from the partial raw data that have many cameras and of a matrix color pixel . this algorithm is also known as CFA inter@@ pol@@ ation or color reconstruction .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; and D@@ cra@@ w will present you three alternatives : Bil@@ in@@ ear , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gradient ) it was the first algorithm created by D@@ cra@@ w . it creates source text file on edges . Bil@@ in@@ ear is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with acceptable results .
if you know the color feed of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a sof@@ tening correction , since it is done during the raw conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions as these again should be given . there are also LC@@ MS and &amp; digi@@ plug , information such as the color information of a colour space in the others to transl@@ ate the colors as exactly as possible .
behavior Questions if a picture is opened in image processing / color management module with raw material files .
colour profile folder S@@ ing here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you want to save all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ plug , this folder was examined during the start .
settings of the ICC profiles have here the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profile to deposit . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the color @-@ management view is an alternative compared to X@@ cali@@ b or Arg@@ anda . only your images are not managed by the entire screen .
the input profiles should be able to use the camera manufacturers and model . there are some , such as Canon , that contain no color mapping or gam@@ ma@@ ize . currently , d@@ c@@ w Gamma is not corrected for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you need to perform the color mapping yourself .
there are other options like the Soft Pro@@ of @-@ Profile , which you can em@@ ulate as your image from one device again . this is very useful before you can print a smaller color range when your printer may work as your camera and some colors , so you could manually correct instead of the flash algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras , it is quite evident that color profile is intended for them . unfortunately , not in the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles fit together . this answer is naturally un@@ official :
the Canon Line extension leaves the style for the purpose : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image plug @-@ in interface . it is an interface that can support from a series of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewing and image processing is supported ; many modules support which have been written to work with each program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has the K@@ IP@@ I modules installed , you will see a list of available modules . choose which you want to use and these will be loaded by &amp; digi@@ plug ; loaded . these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and beyond . you will find some also in the context menu of the preview window .
initial commands for tasks that are carried out by modules can be fixed in the menu under settings of short commands .
for more information ( in English ) via K@@ IP@@ I modules you can get via the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ k@@ ip@@ i @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or via the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the Di@@ ash@@ au should be easy to understand . the upper regulator is adjustable between the image trans@@ itions , normally they are 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . the other check boxes turn off the met@@ ad@@ ata or , which ends at the bottom end of the pictures during the display .
the camera characteristics show a list of all cameras supported on the left . if you want to use a camera that is connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure that the camera is properly connected , switched on and in the picture display . here are Seri@@ elle , USB@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire @-@ Mass memory .
at the bottom end you can set the path for USB@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IEEE @-@ 1394 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage camera . this field is only active if you have a USB@@ - or Fire@@ Wire @-@ mass storage camera from the camera . you need to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / band where you can depend on your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug , you need to connect the camera to your computer to display it in display mode .
check out whether &amp; digi@@ plug ; the camera automatically det@@ ects . if not , you can set camera models and port manually . after your camera set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera .
you can select any designation for your camera . it is displayed in the menu Cam@@ eras of the main window . if you own more than a camera , you can add them all here .
with the option dialog for re@@ loc@@ ating &gt; Pictures in the tr@@ ash@@ can , you can set the conversation of &amp; digi@@ plug ; when del@@ eting a photos in an album , you can find further details on the del@@ eting of a photos and delete a album .
editorial changes due to the right side@@ bar can be shut down in silence by &amp; digi@@ plug ; if you use the changes in the right side@@ bar without rel@@ ays . otherwise , you have to use the changes with the button changes .
you can also change the indication of the welcome image of &amp; digi@@ plug ; in the start , this can accelerate the start @-@ up of &amp; digi@@ plug .
the setting w@@ m take off after new photos ; seek to search for new or deleted albums / photos ; this extends the start time from &amp; digi@@ plug ; if something from the base folder , asks &amp; digi@@ plug , you ask if it should delete them out of the database .
different color schem@@ as can be used in &amp; digi@@ plug ; used to adjust the main window to your taste . this settings can choose from the tool@@ bar . a preview of available designs will be noted below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ plug , you will find further information about this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ plug , contains a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos and to improve and improvement . the picture processing can be started by a click with the left mouse button on the preview of a picture or by the context menu of the preview and selection of the updated ad / editing .
the picture processing contains a number of tools to improve your pictures . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ plug . so , they are not part of your distribution . more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules can be found in the picture processing .
a status line at the lower edge of the window , fil@@ en@@ ame , current record number , magni@@ fication factor and current image size .
a menu bar at the top edge and including the tool bar for quick access to the most common functions .
the processing functions of the im@@ aging change your photos . however , no functions will change the original photo , before you can save the Save or button Save from the tool bar . note that you can &apos;t restore the original photo , once you have saved the picture .
so you might make a copy of your image before you change it . you can Save to Save as file .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can use the original image again by using the menu File Recovery or button Der Knopf Re@@ produce the Edit Recover in the tool@@ bar . they lose any change that you have carried out in the photo since the last store .
virtually any action of the im@@ aging can be re@@ mod@@ elled or re @-@ produced . the last promotion can be re@@ mod@@ elled by changing editing , or re @-@ produced by converting processing from the menu .
if you &apos;re often using this , you should replace the shortest , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ z on the back and c@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ Z to restore .
if you select the &amp; L@@ MB ; via the rear or restore button in the tool bar , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all the actions are re@@ produced or restored .
once you started the image processing , you can move between the photos in the same album or same key@@ word by using the navigation button in the tool@@ bar , image below or the entries in the menu file . if you have changed changes to the current photo , you will be asked if you want to save them .
you can put in the photo in the photo , in which you can use C@@ tr@@ l ; Maus@@ oleum or the icons in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the box menu .
to adapt a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool bar : magni@@ fication factor automatically
view Full Screen Mode photo shows the photo in full screen mode . if you don &apos;t want to use the Es@@ c button . if you don &apos;t want to change this , you can call this in the dialog dialog of &amp; digi@@ plug . you can view this from the &amp; digi@@ plug . see this section for setting up the image processing .
if you want to print the current image , you can select image printing in the menu image and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can custom@@ ize settings before using your photo .
from the main menu you can print individual images or full movements . all images can choose from your selection . you only need to select the images with the standard methods and select from the menu album Export printer assistance . if you follow the assistant , you just need to make your choice .
the digi@@ plug comes ; main window has a side@@ bar at right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected pictures . the same side@@ bar is available without the navigation components , even in the image processing . it is displayed if one of the five riders is attached :
multiple clicking on the same rider can appear the side@@ bar or disappear again in the edge .
in the labelling view , you can enter or insert the note down . the text is UTF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed to enter the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - Felder , so that you can use other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut and special characters are formed after 2000 characters . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling box in other applications , you should consider this restrictions .
after having commented it , use either the button user or change to the next image , which will then be saved .
in addition to the user @-@ button there is a button More . with this , you can read more met@@ ad@@ ata from the selected file or the database . however , this will always be carried out when you select a met@@ ad@@ ata setting that is always written into the pictures .
the section evalu@@ ates a value f@@ ema of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sor@@ ter . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard ab@@ brevi@@ ation C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . in order to evaluate several pictures simultaneously , select this from and use the context menu .
the evaluation will be written in the IP@@ TC field . the coding follows the scheme in the following table :
the key@@ word shows a search box for fil@@ tering the key@@ words , the key@@ word tree and a selection box with the previously in this &amp; digi@@ plug ; -@@ Session applied key@@ words .
the key@@ word tree will be adapted dynam@@ ically to the entered search phr@@ ase . you can restri@@ ct the number of possibilities when searching for a key@@ word . this ability is especially useful if you have many keywords .
the input field at the lower end is a further relief for the input of key@@ words in a photo series . if you have entered several words , these are stored for quick access .
keywords can also be placed by selecting the corresponding check boxes in the tree . all tags of a picture are stored in the IP@@ TC field Key@@ word .
if several pictures are chosen in the main screen and select a key@@ word in the key@@ word tree , this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection , if you want a selection with a key@@ word , please read the key@@ word filter .
the side@@ bar key@@ word filter is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side@@ bar will be used with their album , - fil@@ en@@ - , key@@ word and search filters . if in addition one or several key@@ word filter will be used , only the cut @-@ quantity of these two are displayed . all created words are available .
you can also draw and retri@@ eve . suppose you have chosen several pictures in the main screen . if the key@@ word already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side@@ bar and set it onto the selection . as a dialog you will ask if you want to transl@@ ate the key@@ word .
in the upper example shows the pictures on a calendar day . the key@@ word filter is reduced to a few words . they were selected with C@@ tr@@ l + a , and then a key@@ word from the right @-@ key@@ word tree were drawn up and put there . a dialog asks whether this key@@ word should be set .
this search for changes occurs in every start of the program . you can also be switched on settings different .
if you have a rule with and created and establish it , you can easily change it with a double @-@ click on the text and control area .
( 1 ) : the entry , after which in the database is sought . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , image , key@@ word , etc .
( 3 ) The argument for the operator , which is a name or a string , which is already set in the database .
you can define a wide search for all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group@@ ed options , you only need the check box at the end of the rule and then click the button group@@ ing . the options are as follows :
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or fli@@ ck@@ r not listed ? the free space is limited to 1 GB and you don &apos;t want to save the images in full resolution .
this article / tutorial has been written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this job . I have mostly adapted to &amp; digi@@ plug ; s specific implementation .
the reason why one &apos;s color @-@ managed workflow is a predic@@ table deviation from the actually used or missing colors . using a colour@@ less workflow , you can reach the colors on your monitor or sc@@ anners like the same and the colours that correspond to them from your digital dark chamber .
if the theme appears on color administration , then everyone wants to express what buttons he needs to provide adequate decisions regarding each point of image processing work@@ flows . in addition , these tut@@ orials will make you adequate background information about color administration . additionally , you should make your own inform@@ ation@@ decisions to make your own inform@@ ation@@ decisions to make your desired results .
if your image work@@ flows shall be fulfilled every six below , then you do not need to worry about colour management .
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated on the RGB colour space . ( more information see below )
its only other educational expenditure include email or the web where s@@ RGB at de @-@ fac@@ to standard is .
so if s@@ RGB works so well and life for all so easy , why should we use another colour space and make thoughts about color p@@ ng ng ?
a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB compared to the colors we really can see below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hu@@ fe@@ isen@@ ular region , and the colors in the RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB using some larger farms , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms page and then click on info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to test my monitor at my monitor when I decided to work in the s@@ RGB colour space ?
yes ! if you are working in the RGB color space or do not , you need to make your monitor k@@ alli@@ zed , since the RGB of your monitor is simply simply the circle . if you simply use your monitor to the RGB standard , you need to use either your monitor to the RGB @-@ standard k@@ alli@@ s , an appropriate monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions which can improve a picture in most cases . use it as they try to try a further manual processing .
the functions Normal@@ izing , ab@@ ated , Automatic ab@@ norm@@ ality and contrast expands from the menu , automatically try to experiment the best . they are to experiment with these effects , to see what works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled the Leu@@ st@@ stronger values above the entire picture , so that the dar@@ k@@ est point is black and the brigh@@ test point as bright as possible . this function is often an gast@@ ric correction for pictures that are dark or balanced .
compare : this method covers the lumin@@ osity of the colours of the selected image so that the hist@@ ogram of intensity is as flat as possible . sometimes , the same very good results in the improvement of the contrast of a picture , sometimes produces only rub@@ b@@ ish . it concerns a very powerful surgery that causes either miracles in an image or destroyed it .
automatic adjustment : this method maxim@@ izes color , green and blue canal . it determines the dark and bright bound@@ aries and adjusted the red , green and blue channels on the entire hist@@ o@@ gram@@ m@@ ons .
contra@@ cted : this method improves the contrast and the lumin@@ osity of RGB values of a picture through the lowest and highest values of all values between . this is only visible when balanced pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white sign of &amp; digi@@ plug comes ; is a semi @-@ automated tool to do the white equal to one photos .
the white @-@ equal correction is something limited because of a color space with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you are able to perform areas with over@@ exposure . if you can perform the white equal in the shell mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities will exp@@ ire to correction better .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm of the copyright of Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you start the menu entry colors white equal to the image processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left side are adapted to the original image as well as the preview of the target image . the preview will be dynam@@ ically adapted to the settings of the tool . if you like to see the original wh@@ ip , then it is enough to click the bottom window .
the preview of the target photos has a red mark@@ er . the lumin@@ ance of the Pix@@ els under this mark@@ er is displayed as a vertical line in hist@@ ogram .
on the right above , a hist@@ ogram is displayed as soon as you have changed a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in good illuminated images , most of the pixels very small L@@ umin@@ ous values . with one button you can choose whether one of the three colors or your sum will be indicated . the sum will be L@@ umin@@ ous .
the contrast of your result depends on sh@@ adows , saturation and Gamma . the sh@@ adows is adjustable and down the shadow details of your photos or down .
with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press the colour temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press on this kno@@ b and then to use the selected color for calcul@@ ating the color temperature of the white strain . on this type , the temperature and green values are automatically set .
in addition , you can set the white equal with the list of default settings . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicators increases the colors when more than one color channel of the Pix@@ els is displayed . this will be shown in preview as a pure indicator and does not have any effect on the final image .
buttons Save as and shop make exactly this . any setting of the white equal set you can use this in a text file and then load it later .
the button pre@@ ferences sets all filter values again on their standard values and the corresponding neutral white fl@@ ue . note that even neutral settings will be put another photo as your original . if you want to save your original image .
you can set the co@@ axial antenna per color channel of the mach@@ ined image . 8 @-@ bit encoding is better suitable for high @-@ quality images . this coding is also better for high quality images . this coding requires even more disk space , calcul@@ ator and stands only for the formats PNG , P@@ N@@ M , TIFF and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialogue as to the processing of raw profiles . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color mapping can be done by the sub@@ window for the use of color profiles . a detailed instructions for use of color pro@@ filing allows you to rate the chapter colour management .
another important tool is available in the menu under the colors of clay correction . this tool provides an integrated way to store multiple color channels simultaneously and allow you to use them for several photos . this is helpful if your camera or your scanner will always make the same mist@@ akes and you can always find the same correction . in the manual for the pitch correction , you will find more information .
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool to gra@@ dation that you find under colors Gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool colour effects will give you four colour effects , a solar control effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on @-@ effect and a can@@ ten@@ ant filter .
in times of the chemical processing , Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was a effect of the additional light . this had the effect that the brigh@@ ter areas dar@@ ker and the colours were inver@@ ted by the second lighting . the result was a partial neg@@ atively of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine .
the intensity controls solar power . at approx . 50 % intensity shows the picture which is chem@@ ically possible . another increase is generated , a negative figure that is not possible to generate phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier .
this is an example of the solar effect . the original is the ( 1 ) and it processes ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid @-@ filters sim@@ ulates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; it differs from a saturation that he has a stronger contrast effect which makes the colors brilliant and smooth . try it easy , it emb@@ ell@@ ished many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an daylight optimized colour film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . Vel@@ via offers very saturated color in daylight and high contra@@ sts . the characteristics make him a film of choice for natural photography . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly contains saturated colors , but also some phot@@ ograph@@ ers , especially of which the scar@@ ce scenery , too much .
the Ne@@ on@@ filter sim@@ ulates Neon on@@ light on the contra@@ di@@ edges . the parameter level controls the magnitude of the results and the shooting repet@@ itions the thickness of Ne@@ on@@ light . in large pictures the filter enables the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not un@@ usually that you want to correct the color mixing and the lumin@@ osity of the photos . all your opinions can be viewed in preview . once you are satisfied with the result , use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you make a photo of bad light conditions , you can get a good choice for brightness / saturation . also in this case , it is the tool for brightness / saturation instead of increasing . all the changes you can perform in preview . if the result is the result , you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool Gra@@ dation and the simple leu@@ ch@@ starch / contrast / Gamma is the tool key correction to improve the exposure . even if the dialog for this tool is very complicated , you need only the use of the shooting . concrete the three sliding below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a graph@@ s of intensity values , an hist@@ ogram , active channel or the selected area . under the graph , three sli@@ ders can be cli@@ cked and post@@ pon@@ ed to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side of the bright areas .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to learn the control is to post@@ p@@ one the kno@@ b and keep on it how the image changes .
on the right hand , the original and preview of the Image can be viewed . preview is dynam@@ ically , based on the settings of the picture , updated . on the left , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : this selection box can be adjusted if the hist@@ ogram with linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis is displayed . for images of a digital camera , the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single pillar . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic entry is useful .
three kno@@ b : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the medium tones , commonly known gam@@ ma@@ values .
the three color pin p@@ aces can be used in preview of the original image , in order to adjust the input values of the shade , medium and bright tones automatically . in addition there is a button for fully automatic alignment .
output values : the output values allow manual values for each area . there are also two kno@@ b the output values can be used in order to evaluate the output values . for example , compression values can be used as background images as background , while something else in the fore@@ ground can be seen .
automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image .
save as and loading : these buttons can be stored in the file system and later re@@ loaded . the Gim@@ p levels format will be used .
when you use this mode and use the three color p@@ aces , the input values automatically adjust for all shade , funds and sun tones . activate the color p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the preview of the original program for rot@@ ational , green , blue and lumin@@ osity .
the option over@@ exposed images control all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and indicate you the combined result of all channels . this means that the effect can only be shown in preview and no effect can be seen in the final result .
below is an example of the alignment of input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and correct image with ( 2 ) .
on the left hand , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview can be updated dynam@@ ically depending on your settings . on the right side the following options are available :
modifications channel : this selection box allows the channel to specify the channel :
in addition to this cage , two symbols are used to switch between a linear and a log@@ arith@@ mic view . for images which have been recorded using a digital camera . for images with large areas of constant colour , linear mode generates a wide beam . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic mode helps .
for example , if you move to the right , e.g. the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones are correspon@@ dent with dar@@ ker output and the corresponding pixel of pixel are dar@@ ker .
on the preview of the original photos is a red markings to see . if you want to change this sign to the area you want to move , the matching line shows the original value . create a point on this line and move it off and off until the value is adjusted according to your taste .
save as and charging : with these buttons , you can do exactly this . each curve that generated you can be stored in the file system and later loaded . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p cur@@ vy format .
when you create this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ aces buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of the shadow , medium and sun tones . activate the color p@@ ette that you want and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and L@@ umin@@ ous curve .
the option over@@ exposed images control all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than a channel over@@ exposed pixels , you get a indicator , that means you get the effect just in preview and no effect can be seen in the final result .
below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo , which was set in L@@ umin@@ ous channel . shadow and sun@@ shades was applied with the colour pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original is ( 1 ) and correct ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer of the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing is a tool to improve the colour channels or change the shade of color photos .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the color shades of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors Channel Mixer from the Image Processing .
with the channel selection box , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first hint as you can correct the relative distribution and r@@ ash . the left area of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed as comparison of your own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red mark@@ er . if you positioning this image , a vertical line will appear in the hist@@ ogram with you the corresponding color value .
the controls for the module are right below : kno@@ b for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels even if you are also able to activate the respective color mixing , as the channel bl@@ ender then is THE tool for generating great black @-@ and @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ och@@ rome , the reduction of a colour is in a visible smoke that comes from far@@ brau@@ schen . if that is the case , you can improve your Mon@@ och@@ rome conversion as a result in which you can reduce the far@@ brau@@ schen .
the Save as and loading buttons are used exactly to this purpose . any arbitr@@ ary mixer setting can thus save and then load . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel @-@ mixer format .
the option over@@ exposed images control all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and indicate you the combined result of all channels . this means that the effect can only be shown in preview and no effect can be seen in the final result .
below you can see a photo in the blue canal . the L@@ umin@@ ance option is activated . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the working picture below ( 2 ) can be seen .
black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a working step , because colour pictures can easily be converted to the computer . also with a set of film pockets .

green filters : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a green len@@ tic@@ ulate filter . this looks good , with all scenarios and fits especially well to portraits of the sky . similar to the 004 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) green filter .
orange filters : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a orange linear filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) or@@ chard .
Rot@@ filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a red line filter . this creates dramatic sky@@ effects and can sim@@ ulate lun@@ atic life . so much like the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Rot@@ filter .
yellow filters : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with an yellow lens filters . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similarly to 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) yellow filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : this is produced warm and medium tones throughout the sh@@ ines . this is very similar to the process of fl@@ ashing of a print and re @-@ development in a sep@@ tic converter . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and thus similarly to the 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool texture allows you to apply decorative tex@@ tures on a picture .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a colour screen or not , you can look like an oil painting on a canvas , the Sti@@ ch of an old master , a pop @-@ portrait of enlarged points or as a mur@@ al on a wall . the menu entry is used for image processing .
relief : shift this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three dimensional stability of the texture on the picture .
a paper texture rate is applied on the photo below . the original picture is ( 1 ) and that changed under ( 2 ) . the relief was set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool frame can add a decorative frame to be added a picture .
to hold the eye of a viewer in the bound@@ aries of a photos , no easy task . an opportunity to keep his attention is a decorative eye . this is a psychological barrier for scatter@@ ing eye . under picture frame , the module can be started out of image processing .
type : with this parameter set you the desired cream type for your image . the picture with a colored line , ni@@ ep@@ ce surro@@ unds it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ white pictures ) , dist@@ illed it with a nice three @-@ dimensional setting , ideal for a button@@ hole and decor@@ atively adding a decorative frame with pattern .
width : specifies the width of the frame in percent . the value range for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
the target image will be bigger than the original but the same aspect ratio is greater than the original but the same aspect ratio . this is important for the pressure of pictures , especially when using the tool .
with this practical tool , you can easily add a format@@ ted text in a picture at any place . this will also occur in several places when you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . just enter text direction , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its features such as you need . the larger the picture , the bigger must be the character set . at the end , simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
any setting that you have chosen for your text can be changed , until you have changed to the button &quot; OK &quot; after the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can &apos;t be changed .
with the &amp; digi@@ plug , set templates , you can put on a template on a picture .
the menu image templates can be used in image processing can be used to create sten@@ cils on a picture .
for the sten@@ cil there is no restrictions regarding the size and orientation . you need to add the PNG file format and you should add your template &apos;s size of template ; just send an e @-@ mail in English to the &amp; digi@@ plug ; mail@@ ing@@ list digi@@ arrived @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org ..
if you use this tool for the first time , you have to set your sten@@ cil folders with the button base folder in the dialog . select the folder where you will have the templates that you see the templates .
after the root folder for the sten@@ cils , a building view , which reflects the folder &apos;s structure of the template . the selection of a folder will be updated automatically .
below are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
Enlarge : this button enlarges the displayed image . it is cent@@ ered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shr@@ inking : this button resi@@ zed the lower picture . in order to apply the position of the mouse , in order to apply the template on the whole image , you must be reduced accordingly to the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the picture below the template . take the picture and place it on the desired position .
use OK when you want to use template on your picture . the image will then be adjusted automatically .
digi@@ plug comes ; presents three different tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . each of you has pre@@ ferences in other areas .
shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but creates , especially in dark fields , gra@@ ined pictures .
Un@@ shar@@ fe mask works on the contrast of the edges in order to cool a picture of sharp@@ ness . indeed , it &apos;s not a bit , it works rather psych@@ ovis@@ ual . you can use it for a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is copyright protected by Win@@ ston Chang .
re@@ focus is probably the best of the three , since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its use and has various parameters to adapt .
photos without focus as well as most digit@@ ised images need a correction of the sharp@@ ness . these elements are smaller than the dis@@ solution to a common colour . this again leads to a common colour . the same phenomenon can be printed on paper . SLR cameras require usually more retro@@ spec@@ tively as normal cameras for home users .
with JPEG images often a camera has been applied to internal shar@@ pen@@ ing . in contrast , images in the shell format only have to be welded during processing .
some sc@@ anners apply a shar@@ pen@@ ing filter already during the image of the image . when you de@@ activate this , check out the control over your picture .
in some situations you can get usable results by shar@@ pen@@ ing a photograph with the shar@@ pen@@ ing work . this allows you to correct shar@@ pen@@ ing shar@@ pen@@ ing .
however , they should be careful , since the results are not very natural : the sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also ampli@@ fied the noise . in general , it is necessary to correct editing a picture . you can find more information about the menu icon . below re@@ focus , you will find further information and compare all techniques to shar@@ pen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution that character@@ ize the image is much easier than to shar@@ pen . use the tool to correct switch with the menu entry . use the preview window on the right side of the dialog box gives you the effect on your photo .
the filter un@@ bl@@ ur@@ red is a very good tool to remove sli@@ ders from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original and preview can help the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values produce good results and should increase the effect . if you make the yield mask to be strong , smo@@ kers and the impression of gr@@ ates will produce in the vicinity of sharp edges .
the radius indicates how many pixels are affected on each side of an edge with the filters . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . they should therefore show pictures best in its final resolution .
the amount is added to the percentage between the original and the selected image one of the original is added . this will set the strength of the sharp@@ ness .
the sw@@ ell@@ worth is a break from the maximum RGB value and the difference between the difference . you can define a minimum difference this way with a soft change between the tones of the shar@@ pen and therefore beauti@@ full errors in faces , pe@@ eling and water surfaces are avoided .
this is an example of the un@@ bl@@ ur@@ red filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the working picture ( 2 ) . un@@ bl@@ ur@@ red was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a sw@@ elling value = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool re@@ focus on a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copyright protected de@@ fle@@ ction filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries an image to &amp; quot ; re@@ focus on it . it uses a technique called F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ tering . it uses a technique called F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ tering . it is often achieved better results than un@@ bl@@ ur@@ red . you can start it from the menu by calling colors re@@ focus on image processing .
in practice , the circular flow is much better than the G@@ auss &apos;s F@@ itting . the F@@ IR Wiener In@@ verse has also been removed from the source pix@@ eln , which is far from the original qu@@ ell@@ ous pixels . the F@@ IR Vienna In@@ verse Is even influenced in most cases even very strong by the remote pixels . the un@@ wanted results are un@@ wanted .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular f@@ axes . it is the most important parameter for use this module . for most images , the default value should be 1 good results . you can set a higher value if your image is very un@@ bl@@ ur@@ red should then be shown to Heiligen@@ sch@@ a .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help Ar@@ te@@ facts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values at 1 , &amp; eg ; 0,@@ 95 and 0,@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the effect of the module .
Rau@@ sch@@ filters : an increase in the space filter can help you to reduce ar@@ te@@ facts . however , values are higher than 0.1 only rarely . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 becomes the image quality very bad . a bit value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value will be even more sensitive .
G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness . in most cases , you should leave this value to 0 to avoid anno@@ yed arti@@ facts , so you may also increase the correlation and / or the noise filters .
matrix size : this value determines the size of transformation matrix . an increase of matrix size can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness . note that the module is very slow when you choose large values for this parameter . in most cases you should choose a value in the range from 3 @-@ 10 .
the saving as and loading buttons will be used exactly to this purpose . any re@@ focus parameters will be added to you later and can be loaded later .
try to perform all the trimm@@ ing , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the picture before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before you change the image . the reason for this is that much sur@@ geri@@ es changes did not immediately appear immediately , which later left un@@ pleasant arti@@ facts .
if you read images and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; when JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , un@@ bl@@ ur@@ red produces better results as shar@@ pen@@ ing . this might be caused by bl@@ ur@@ red a larger neighborhood as shar@@ pen@@ ing .
theore@@ tically it needs to be bl@@ ur@@ red . even under optimal conditions it can never remove any effect of un@@ shar@@ pen . for the Vien@@ nese filters you can always show the result of the F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ ters always at least as well as the M@@ IR filters . the F@@ IR filter filter is often better when machining small details .
below , you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a little un@@ focused picture :
this picture has to be corrected . this picture has to be corrected using a analog camera . the un@@ focused outcome is due to in@@ sufficient light for the car focus lens .
for more information about methods to shar@@ pen@@ ing pen@@ dic@@ ular in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English below this address .
the regulator is the un@@ shar@@ pen of the ec@@ lipse , in order to create a more natural P@@ up@@ ille .
the color tin@@ ker offers an adapted color for the pup@@ il . if you want to set blue eyes instead of dark , then you can set this here .
the mould error correction is one of the most developed tool in order to remove the desired ar@@ is@@ factory with an unprecedented level .
the In@@ test@@ algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE Team of the GR@@ EC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains several settings as a set of points to simpli@@ fy the restoration . the default settings are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use the hor@@ semen and advanced settings .
detail@@ ing p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the conservation of details . a smaller value leads to a smooth glass of smoo@@ thing and details . a value of 0.9 should be used mainly homogen@@ ous regions of smooth and details . please note that no shar@@ pen@@ ing is necessary . please note that the details can always be sub@@ ordin@@ ated .
direction depen@@ dency alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth evenly into all directions , while a value close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film gra@@ ined or a CCD noise , we will produce a high value w@@ ron@@ eous patterns . JPEG Ar@@ te@@ fak@@ te will be best removed at a value close to 1 .
smoo@@ thing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this set the maximum smoo@@ thing factor over all@@ es. p then defines the relative smoo@@ thing . set this value matching the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects greater structures . the higher this value is needed , the more will be sm@@ ooth@@ ed , since then it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be higher than 3 .
repet@@ itions : indicates how often the algorithm is going through . usually goes 1 or 2 here .
angle distance da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha small is chosen , there should also be small . consider that small angle should be a long runtime . you should choose this value so si@@ t@@ able and acceptable for your needs .
integ@@ rating distance width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integrated step width in pixels . you should set the value below 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel gl@@ ass@@ ment and never exceed 2 .
linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation Use : this option can be obtained by selecting this option , but it doubles the runtime of this option , but it doubles the runtime . we therefore recommend it to allow him .
buttons Save as and store make exactly this . any setting of images error can be saved in a text file and later re@@ loaded .
image error correction is compar@@ atively very fast in work . but it can still last long and a high CPU load after moving . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the kno@@ b .
below you can see how pictures can be removed with little arti@@ facts . the module is used on a photo that was created in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you see there is an independent black arti@@ fact fact that caused by a bad film storage during the journey . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; a noise reduction is a very powerful tool to decrease assets . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Peter rear .
this tool provides selectable image filters to remove st@@ ains and other ar@@ te@@ facts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens , too . it can also be used to remove sensors from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ . ; - effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensor bat@@ ches of digital cameras , you can read this tutorial in English in this tutorial .
the screen picture above shows a typical scene which was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ ined noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following cases you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ windows of advanced settings can remain in default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 41@@ x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . great values increase the time that the filter is needed per pixel and allows the image administered over the image and colour in it is sm@@ ooth@@ ed and thus smaller errors .
sharp@@ ness : controlled the sharp@@ ness of the pixel . this value sets the pixel pitch behind the filter to the front . if it is increased , you need to change the edges . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter picture details can &apos;t be preserved and smo@@ ked once again .
edges : controlled the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , the total noise cannot be removed or smo@@ k@@ able . set him to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG arti@@ facts .
lumin@@ ance : controlled the lumin@@ ance frequency of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings may not influence the smoo@@ thing process by the details settings .
color : controls the color toler@@ ant of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings may not influence the smoo@@ thing process by the details settings .
gamma : controlled the Gam@@ mat@@ ol@@ er@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dar@@ ker areas , which typically are stronger than to increase . it also cont@@ am@@ inated the shadow ranges .
damp@@ ing : controlled by ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ ing damp@@ ing . this value defines how fast the adap@@ tive filter radius on variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , the edges appear to be high , the noise and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter will occur at the edges . it can remove cra@@ ck@@ down and is the recommended method for it .
save and store : these buttons are used exactly . all parameters for noise reduction that you have set can be stored into the file system and later loaded .
this is an example how str@@ ust your life can change . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and correct with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cris@@ p for your purpose . fortunately , the image is much easier to draw with the menu entry . use tool to correct switch with the menu entry . the preview window is shown on the right side of the dialog box shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photographs acts .
this filter for restoration gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of un@@ wanted ar@@ te@@ as from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove pal@@ ms , c@@ rat@@ ers , compres@@ sive pictures , scrat@@ ches , compression technology and local errors inside the con@@ tours and thus receives the contents as it also makes the human eye .
the same algorithm can be used for colour and tex@@ turing . the text creation is developed with a different tool , the error correction was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the GR@@ EC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ bs and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG Ar@@ te@@ facts : the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as a deser@@ ted compression algorithm created he creates some compression &amp; quot ; - small standards that are shown in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct the problems .
buttons Save as and store make exactly this . any setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and later re@@ loaded .
photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast in the job . but it can still last long and a high CPU load after moving . you can therefore stop the calculation at any time with the button finish .
below you can minim@@ ise like a photo with a shaped noise . the module is applied to a black and white photo that with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO ( TM ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can recognize the inf@@ am@@ ous film gra@@ ined on the faces . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and correct under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time Tex@@ tures can minim@@ ize on an old color photograph taken with a scanner . you can see the scan species from the scanner lighting and the photo paper . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool Hot@@ pixel allowed it hot@@ pixel by photos those with a CCD camera , eight were removed too . it uses algorith@@ ms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pix@@ i project which are protected by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , dead or hot pixels are particularly in high quality raw mode photos a problem as many cameras with JPEG compression can have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixel quot ; and &quot; quot ; luminous pix@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark image sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wi@@ z@@ ard with the button dar@@ ken@@ ing . the tool automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the picture preview .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you can pick up the dark picture directly in the connection to discover new hot or light pixel by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should download the matching dark image to the correct image . notice that the assistant will notice the last dark image and automatically loads this in the next session .
the image and preview can help you correct within the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings . poor pixels are lifted in all areas .
select an area around the def@@ ective pixels on the preview and check the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the available filter :
thirst : an average of the neigh@@ bors is determined . the resulting colour is assigned to all def@@ ective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are moved to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are moved to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
Kub@@ isch : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less will be moved to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the broken pixel in the block .
below , you can see the hot@@ pixel correction on a colour photo taken from a faul@@ ty digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and a long exposure . the original picture has been increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture is below ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ plug comes ; Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fication correction is a tool to correct the Vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. exposed corners , one image .
wide angle lens , especially those in the middle and large photo format , can not equally illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ting quot ; ( shaded ) it reaches the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light to reach the sensor there . tel@@ e@@ objective also show these characteristics .
but it also has dis@@ advantages . many Center filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 at the aperture filter , which should not be impossible to keep the camera with hand . wide angle lens should also be used , even with center filter , a opening of f / 16 or small , otherwise un@@ shar@@ pen effects can be created by movement .
with the great exposure areas of today &apos;s fil@@ tering and film scanner , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a Cent@@ er@@ filter using a shell filter using a Cent@@ er@@ filter on an image . the algorithm is protected by John Walker .
with three shelves , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fication filter and control three additional exposure of the target .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light ampli@@ fication at the point of the largest density . the standard density is 2.0 , resulting in an optical filter with a aperture setting of 1 , or random to compens@@ ate a greater degree of vig@@ net@@ ting to compens@@ ate , reduce him to compens@@ ate a small degree .
Leu@@ ch@@ starch , contrast and gamma settings : the editing of a picture with the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fication correction reduces the lumin@@ osity of the pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target images with these options . the regulator do only have positive values , because you need to increase the settings .
if you want a fine tuning of the exposure of the target image , you let the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / Gamma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing from the menu color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fication correction to a picture . the original picture ( 1 ) shows the Vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the correct image . a leu@@ k@@ ampli@@ ke@@ - and contrast correction was also done in the picture with this tool .
the digi@@ plug comes ; Lin@@ king distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses an copyright protected algorithm by David Hod@@ son .
this tool is working with geomet@@ ric distortion . colour distortion can not be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree is treated with the general geomet@@ ric distortion of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
the coefficient of third volume has a similar effect , but fl@@ atten@@ ed on edges . this correction is not applied in the mold .
the coefficient of gravity corrected the distant corners to which the second ridge . if you combine these two , each geomet@@ ric distortion is virtually eliminated .
generally : this value controls the strength of the distortion second ridge . with negative values , tonn@@ age can be corrected and positive values .
corner : this value controls the thickness of the distortion . this value has stronger than in the center of the image . for most lenses the &apos; corners parameter has the pre @-@ returned pre @-@ sign of the parameter .
zoom : this value sc@@ aled the image size , resulting in a correction first gra@@ des by . negative values increase during positive the image .
brigh@@ ter : this value is adjusted in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase it .
to help you can find the best filter settings , illustrates the dialog box with a preview of the distortion . the values you use for your image are stored and the next start is used as default values .
the tonn@@ age and seasonal correction should be carried out in front of all the cutting or size changes . if you want to cut this correction as all first by . if you want to cut a picture and afterwards a tonn@@ ical correction would be the effect of the folding .
to help you can find the best correction to find you this tool is a vertical and a horizontal aid line . move it into an important place , such as the sea view or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button in order to fix lines at this spot . in the connection you can correct the tonn@@ age / k@@ is@@ sen@@ ular distortion with the help of the lines .
if you corrected a cold @-@ shaped distortion is the resulting image of black corners . you can remove this with the cutting tool into the menu , remove any of the image processing or via the zoom regulator of this dialog .
for most pictures , the next logical step is enough for some moti@@ fs such as photos from the front , frame and paintings , it &apos;s the perspective to correct the angle in the picture 90 degrees . note that when you keep the camera with the hand , you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective .
this is an example of the amount of tons @-@ shaped correction to a church in Norway . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to sim@@ ulate infrared film data . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( TM ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infr@@ ar@@ ot@@ film , see these URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window you can choose the area for preview . if you move the red rectangle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview you can sim@@ ulate two parameters of film gra@@ ins and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . activate the option to sim@@ ulate a highly sensitive film . the ISO kno@@ bs changes the amount of film gra@@ ins and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophyll in nature ) in the conversion . green meadows will white like snow !
since the filter colour channels re@@ produced to re@@ produce infrared film , especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos because the Far@@ bin@@ aries are missing .
this is an example of infrared cinem@@ atic film based on a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the working picture below ( 2 ) and the sensitivity of the film has been set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values produce a type of A@@ ura in the top lights .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter tra@@ ilers is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to re@@ produce film gra@@ ins on your pictures . this is known from classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ dak Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the movies , the manufacturer large silver gra@@ ins of the photo emul@@ sion .
the film effect gives you a certain mood or seems to move into the past . the treated picture gets rid of a tim@@ eless atmosphere release from everyday life . if you want to photograph this special , gallery , strings photography , gra@@ ined photos , so you have to use this filter .
with the kno@@ b the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the body . the default value is although higher values need to be adjusted to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more seeds , you can use the filter several times .
this is an example of the film gra@@ ined on a black / white picture . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and that worked ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting . it uses an ur@@ ber@@ ized algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance , like an oil painting . natural pictures and sty@@ li@@ ants are good for this effect .
there are two kno@@ bs to influence this effect . the upper one cho@@ oses the brush size between one and five . th@@ icker brush are better suited for large pictures . smoo@@ thing controls the smooth or , from the other hand , the Schar@@ fulness .
this is an example of the oil painting @-@ effect . the original picture is marked with the ( 1 ) and the editing pane is marked with ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixel image is 1 and smooth 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter charcoal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to produce a cab@@ bage box . the pictures whose gradient can vary slowly but are not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you would imagine what scene you would have chosen to sk@@ etch out . this would be good pictures to start with it .
there are two kno@@ bs with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper kno@@ b cho@@ oses the size and the lower adjusted the contrast ( smooth ) .
this is an example of the charcoal filter . the original picture ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ plug , filter engraving shaped your picture in 3 @-@ D , as if it was stamped in wax . it uses an copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ plug , filter engraving is a fast tool for giving your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works especially well in pictures with a simple structure , where color does not use the most important object . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey , mon@@ astic landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the fil@@ tering . a value of 30 corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the working picture ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of distortion effect . it uses the copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divi@@ des the picture in cells , and it can be seen as if it is seen through glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : analog@@ ous to the wave blocks 1 , the picture is dist@@ orted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects need a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the button Finish .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by un@@ shar@@ fe effects . it uses the copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom In@@ shar@@ fe : im@@ pregn@@ ated the image along the formal lines coming from a center . this sim@@ ulates the un@@ shar@@ pen of a zo@@ oming camera and thus produces a dynamic expression of often in sports photography .
radical im@@ plantation : caught the image by rotation of the pixels to a center . this sim@@ ulates the impres@@ ses of a turning camera .
distances : wi@@ ped the image to generate the effect of a non @-@ focused camera in@@ se . the object seems to occur in the background .
motion @-@ shar@@ pen : im@@ pregn@@ ated the image by horizontal movement of pixels . this sim@@ ulates the im@@ plantation of a linear movable , z : B : from a car or train photograph@@ ing , camera .
characteristic of soft@@ ness : wi@@ ped the image soft in the dark and strong in the brigh@@ ter tones . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ amour @-@ photos or to add a warm and sub@@ til@@ ting inc@@ and@@ ing .
Schüt@@ tel@@ un@@ shar@@ fe : wi@@ ped the image by random shi@@ fting of pixels and sim@@ ulates the un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ately moving camera .
intelligent Un@@ shar@@ fe : find the Far@@ add@@ ling pool in the picture and wi@@ ped out this without the rest .
mos@@ aic : shares the photo in rectangular cells and created it by filling with an average pixel size .
some effects need a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the button finish .
the rain@@ drops are a nice small tool to make rain drops onto your image . therefore , it gives natural your pictures a great look . it uses a Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n @-@ protected algorithm .
dri@@ pping size allowed to change the size of the drops . since the trop@@ ics size does not grow automatically with the size of the image , it is often necessary to reduce the size for small pictures . number changes the number and density of drops . fish @-@ gen changes the optical effect of drops on the image .
you can use the &amp; digi@@ plug ; im@@ aging a range of free from rain@@ drops . use the tool to select the area , e.g. a face , that should stay free . if you start the filter Reg@@ ent@@ drops , the area will remain free of rain drops .
this is an example of the reg@@ ent felt Fil@@ ters . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a calm sunset and the worked picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it by mirrors or turning into the right orientation . the tools can be found in the menu , turning and trans@@ forming mirrors .
photo infl@@ ates is definitely one of the most developed tools in order to enlarge a photo with a minimum loss of image quality .
a picture to smaller is simple . the big question is how you can find a picture of bub@@ bles and the details can be found here ? how can you find the missing information or guess ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm is used here , making it a good job . try it and you &apos;ll see it yourself .
if a photo is the wrong size you can change it to the desired size with the tool size . choose the size of the menu and enter the target values in the menu and enter the target values below .
the tool used to change a linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation method to increase the pixel error . if you want a small picture with better quality , then try the tool for bub@@ bles .
many image processing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine Inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . &amp; digi@@ plug is a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the GR@@ EC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you need to set the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available in tab new size and are listed below :
keeping the aspect ratio : if this setting is activated , the aspect ratio of the original size is retained at the input of the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects greater structures . the higher this value is needed , the more will be sm@@ ooth@@ ed , since then it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be higher than 3 .
buttons Save as well as loading can be used precisely . each photo file can be stored as a text file and later re@@ loaded .
photo infl@@ ates is very fast in which it makes , but it can still last long and a high CPU load after yourself . you can stop the calculation at any time with the button finish .
you can see an example for photo bub@@ bles by adding a small paint image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and enlarged picture ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard magni@@ fication compared to comparison .
the cutting of a photo is not only a frequently performed surgery but also a commonly used tool to assemble a photo . the mouse is simply just the rectangle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drag the rectangle , then you will see this rectangle during your mouse .
when you release the mouse button , the area of the photos will be cut off . thus you will get a good overview like your photo after cutting area . you can pull the size of the rectangle with the corners of the rectangle , simply create a new rectangle by clicking with the left mouse button .
as soon as you are satisfied with the assignment , use the push button of the image processing in the tool bar and the photo is tail@@ ored ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries to Save or File Save In the menu file to save the newly designed photo .
in the preview area you can change the size of the rectangle by move the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog stays .
in the tool , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or lateral format . in the portrait format , the larger value of the height and in the lateral format of the width is assigned .
the tool for aspect ratio is used to cut a good aspect ratio . this means that it is always equal , regardless of whether you are centi@@ metres , In@@ ch or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and its side ratio .
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to choose the selection automatically horizontal or vertical .
below in the dialog , you can use the Max . ratio button for cutting up to the maximum possible , depending on the selected ratio and orientation , set .
the tool adds to the aspect ratio depending on the image orientation ( Horizont@@ al or Ver@@ tical ) . if you are using the cutting tool , these settings are displayed as standard values depending on the orientation . the modified image dimensions are shown in the EX@@ IF tables so that the EX@@ IF data can be reflected and not the original image .
help the implementation of the implementation help allow to help advice , that you are better to put your pictures better . these help are :
harmon@@ ious triangle : harmon@@ ious particles based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ rule , harmon@@ ic triangles have a possibility to divide a rectangle in similar harmon@@ ic triangles .
golden center : the golden center is a split that is made up of different natural growth models , such as the spiral of a Naut@@ ilus shell , or the leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all possible things that we find as beautiful .
the golden pitch is the error number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and you &apos;ve already used to constru@@ ct your tem@@ ples and pyr@@ am@@ ids . artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your cre@@ ations a natural order and beauty .
the number is from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i Episode 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; from where every number is equal to 1 equal to the sum of their two adv@@ ances . the resulting particle is 1 : 1.6@@ 18 the golden middle . a composition that follows this rule is considered a visual harmon@@ ic .
the golden center provides liquid aid lines if you put an image . these help are shown below :
the Golden Spir@@ al will generate good results for your photos . compared to the third @-@ party gel , the golden spiral is a liquid line that can follow the eye through the eyes . this kind of composition leads along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual flow on this type .
another rule are the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . it should be something that the eye can be at the core of the composition . this may be a line that can be one line or different objects . this can simply be done without the eye , it will fulfil its task .
the golden triangles also lead from the above @-@ discussed golden spiral . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ic triangles , golden triangles no equ@@ il@@ ateral triangles . diagonal to the lines can be found a static object of dynamic .
if you use golden triangles to start your frame , create a effect of professional photo symmet@@ ry . try your image focus on one of the inter@@ sections and other visual information into the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can not reach any other .
the Options Horizont@@ al mirror and vertical mirror images can be used to mirror harmon@@ ious particles .
with the button color you can set the colour of the aid lines . if you have an image with many colors and a high contrast , the auxiliary lines can be invisible . on this way you can custom@@ ize the color of your current image .
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate a picture of any angle .
if you make a photo , then it happens easy to keep the camera not exactly vertical or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture where things to have an angle . you can select this with the &amp; digi@@ plug , image processing and the tool free rotation . choose this transformer and adjust the target angle .
turn your picture with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ der are specified in degrees . with the default settings you can reset the sli@@ der to 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown on the right above .
to help your help , the Module Free Rotation provides a horizontal and a vertical line . after moving it over a key point of the image , you can attach it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle like in the previous section .
after shot an image , you &apos;ll find un@@ wanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to repair this is the function trans@@ forming from the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is automatic cut . choose one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option fits a bit by rotation . however , please note the above warning .
all perc@@ ep@@ tive transform@@ ations are carried out by a fixation point to the so called reference point . this point is represented in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares in the corners of your image . the preview will then be re@@ comp@@ uted automatically . on the right side of the dialog box you will find some information which help you to change the perspective :
new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas that are created through the transformation , in pixels .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas that are created through the transformation , in pixels .
top left : shows the current angle in degrees on the upper left corner of the transformed area .
top right : shows the current angle in degree at the upper right corner of the transformed area .
at the bottom left : shows the current angle in degrees on the lower left corner of the transformed area .
below right : shows the current angle in degree at the bottom right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective the picture becomes a bit dirty . for a single adaptation this effect is small , but two modifications produce a double as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after getting the perspective , you get un@@ pleasant tri@@ angular holes at the corners . a way to ber@@ some is the picture with transform@@ ations from the image processing .
the shooting tool is used to move a part of the image into one direction and move the other part to the opposite . this is no rotation , the image will be dist@@ orted . in other words , a rectangle is transformed into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module via transform@@ ers@@ .
sc@@ iss@@ ors your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . if you press horizontal and vertical at the same time , you can adjust the angle to zero . a preview of the effectiveness will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target will appear on the right of the preview window .
to help your help , a vertical and a horizontal line will be embedded . move the mouse to an important point such as the lake , a wall of a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to attach the lines to adjust your image .
after having carried out the shooting , the picture becomes a bit wi@@ ped . for a single shot this effect is negli@@ gible , but two deposits generated twice as much as lost and therefore you should avoid this .
after the shooting , the image has tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a possibility to eliminate these is the image with transform@@ ations from the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write . those available formats are therefore possible from your system and , in some cases , from the way as these libraries , you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ plug .
due to this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to specify a list of all available file formats on this site , but you will always find JPEG and TIFF .
&amp; digi@@ plug , displays only files in formats . this is done using the file extension and a comparison of these with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , you can change this list of file extensions the &amp; digi@@ plug . in the configuration , you can find more information .
virtually all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allow you to select the format . a detailed description of this file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ plug , both formats are supported .
im@@ compression is the use of data compression procedures to digital pictures . so redund@@ ant information is reduced to save the image data to a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally there are better , gl@@ atter@@ ing results than JPEG in the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s version can also save loss when this is given in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the shell format , you can read more about Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can find raw format images in JPEG or TIFF with the Roh@@ ec@@ tical converter from &amp; digi@@ plug . in the configuration , you can find further information on the usage of modules with &amp; digi@@ plug ; .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; supported the shop of raw images only with the program d@@ c@@ w , which is contained in &amp; digi@@ plug . all support cameras can be seen at the bottom side of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats from &amp; digi@@ plug ; supported :
many digital cameras support the recording short films . these clips are often saved in Avi@@ o or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ plug , but is not a film editing program and comes with no built @-@ in options to view or modify . if you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ plug , the &amp; k@@ de ; Settings for playing films to start playing the program .

K@@ IP@@ I module is a series of images exported to a K@@ ML structure . K@@ ML files can be opened and displayed using Google Earth format .
if you s@@ wap the steps 4 and 5 what you can do well if the initial contrast was very good , then you can perform the first four steps with the module white .
many tools that require the photo processing are in &amp; digi@@ plug , included . their description follows here .
all image processing tools such as shar@@ pen@@ ing , soft@@ ness , noise suppression , un@@ bl@@ ur@@ red , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog box that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; texture user quot ; in this dialogue :
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter on the current picture . left from him allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the occurr@@ ences . these modes are :
vertically split without dup@@ lic@@ ate . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the right of the selected fo@@ ster area .
horizontal parts without dup@@ lic@@ ate . the upper area shows the original and the bottom shows the filter applied to the range below the selected pre@@ swing area .
vertically split . the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
horizontal parts . the upper area shows the original and lower compared to the effect of the filter .
&apos; mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that can turn off to display over@@ - and exposure . the used colors can be adapted in the general setup side .
( 3 ) : the frame to choose from a preview . you can also check this frame with the mouse within the picture and you can see on the part of the image you want to preview . the preview of the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all adjustment from the last use of the module will be noted .
the side@@ bar features displays the essential information on the selected image and is largely un@@ explained . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo features : displays a summary of the most important parameters on the shooting of the photos . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this rider features an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble @-@ Mini@@ program . press C@@ tr@@ l ; lin@@ ker mouse button to draw a square . all images within this coordinates will be filtered and displayed . this is of course ahead of the images of G@@ eo data .
&amp; col@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; is a editor for pall@@ ets files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and to choose from colors .
the pall@@ ets files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de ; can be installed either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case they are located in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; default settings and hot custom color and last used colors .
in the dialog pallet , you can select from a list of installed pall@@ ets or browse the folder to files .
the cur@@ sor is displayed in the pallet view as a line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a colour .
it shows on the color beside it . colour is described under the pallet view . here , the color name can also be changed .
it can also be used to choose . in order to create a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor position . then move your mouse over the left mouse button .
if the check box of the cur@@ sor is inserted under the button color , the color becomes inserted by the color plate at the cur@@ sor . the color becomes either inserted or transl@@ ates a different ; depending on whether the mode has been selected . this mode can be set by clicking the check box over@@ write at Bei@@ m cur@@ sor .
a selection that produces as described in the last section , can be used together with the actions copying , cutting and insert .
&amp; col@@ oring dit ; uses the following format for data in clip@@ board : for each color three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional paint name , followed by a line @-@ end characters , if a further color will follow , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; col@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; to be inserted .
colors in the palette and the output of the color selection can be drawn with the mouse .
select a colour somewhere on the screen and then select the colour on the left .
&amp; k@@ graph@@ s ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ s ; programs are free layout programs . graph@@ s are used in science , especially in computer science . so far , there was no modern &amp; GUI ; programs that include graphics &amp; graphical ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graph@@ s ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs by a modern and user @-@ friendly graphic surface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program to replace .
&amp; k@@ graph@@ s ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ s ; -@@ dot ; graphics . graphics &amp; graph@@ s ; shows graph@@ s with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; at . it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; Kate ; and &amp; cross @-@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of the graphics in &amp; Kate ; it calcul@@ ates the graphics and graph@@ s in &amp; k@@ graph@@ s ; )
menu to open the graph@@ s in &amp; Kate ; to open and open the graph@@ s in &amp; k@@ graph@@ s ; in a &amp; Kate ; component can be opened
download large graph@@ s ( currently there are problems with about 1000 no@@ des and a h@@ ack , to present more than those no@@ des )
additional required software : &amp; k@@ graph@@ s ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program , which the &amp; graph@@ s ; -@@ Tool &amp; dot ; for the presentation of the graphics is required .
the main window displays the open graphics , each in a very own window . initially , if you open &amp; k@@ graph@@ s . in this case , the tool@@ bar contains only the icon file and the ( empty ) list added files . click the first icon to open the dialog file .
once you have a or more &amp; dot ; files selected , the main window looks like in the bottom screen photo :
as you can see , an overview of the corner is displayed if the graph is bigger than the character surface . you can select a fixed position of this overview or select this position automatically with the context menu .
use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right with pressing &amp; Alt ; key ) ;
zoom in both directions is limited by a factor of 10 . below you can see the maximum reduction of a graph@@ s .
when the straight @-@ in &amp; graphic viewer ; loaded file changed from another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the Graph should be re@@ loaded or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graph@@ s , you can also change your choice later . if you want to change your choice later , you can use the menu settings for graph@@ s ; use , see also .
if you open a Graph@@ end@@ ei outside a current &amp; k@@ graph@@ s ; file , &amp; eg ; at the file browser or on the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graph@@ s ; read instance , or to inv@@ ent graph@@ s in a sub@@ window that already want to display the current instance .
as in the last option you can store your choice permanent , but this can also change with the dialog dialog .
at program start , you can open all the graphics of your last session again . again , you can save your choice as well as later .
you can also determine how the graph should be split into several sides . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be chosen freely .
if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graphics that go on a side are igno@@ red on this page . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out of the respective parts of the graphics .
side preview with one on several sides distributed graph@@ s without head@@ line and with another font
the site Er@@ ne@@ ut Lo@@ ading gives the ability to define the behaviour when a file changed on the hard drive , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can ignore a standard behaviour ( automatically re@@ load or modify the changes ) or the program every time .
the page opens the ability to define the behaviour of &amp; k@@ graph@@ s ; if a graph is opened outside a current session . you can open a default behavior for this case or determine the graphics in a new window or determine that each time is asked .
the page seat management provides the ability to set up the start @-@ up of &amp; k@@ graph@@ s . you can set up a standard behaviour ( the files of the last session or not ) or determine where to get asked for every start .
the context menu , which normally appears with one click on the main window with &amp; R@@ MB@@ n , opens further possibilities :
here you can choose among various &amp; graph@@ s ; -@@ lay@@ outs . the entries as they are described on the website of &amp; graph , are :

the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for un@@ sealed graphics . it produces represent@@ ations according to the j@@ umping model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is equivalent to statistical and multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; -@@ algorithm creates a diving @-@ spring model layout . it uses the fru@@ ition pure gold foil , and includes a g@@ itter@@ ing remote trigger for the treatment of large and tor@@ tured graphics .
the &amp; se@@ co ; algorithm uses the no@@ de in shape to the description of Six und Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and Kau@@ ff@@ man and meadow , 2002 . it is useful for certain graph@@ s of multiple cycli@@ c structures .
opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command . the command should accept the graphics file as parameters , and modify the calculated layout of the graphics after st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . using such layout command you can change &amp; eg ; modify the graphics with a filter before it is drawn .
determines the type of graph@@ s ( directed or prepared ) and turns the standard algorithm for the respective type ( red ; for directional , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for un@@ sealed graphics ) .

the K@@ IP@@ I module images include tools available to read new images and to transmit these images .
this module can be used to en@@ rol new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read pictures of a scanner which supported by the s@@ ane project or another source such as video streams . so that this works you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and s@@ ane installed .
if you open the menu entry images , a dialog which lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to pick the image . you can also set the standard source for the next time .
after this , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears to select your needs to select your image . see the preview and custom@@ ize your needs to read the image . the estimated file size is displayed in the right , lower corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information .
note that the window will be displayed completely , since some adjustments otherwise may not be displayed .
after scanning the button Scan you have to wait until the scan is completed and the window to specify the options of the image file . remember that the BMP does not comp@@ ress the compression and therefore very large files . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; choose or create the image automatically .
screen photos can be created after you select in the menu Imp@@ or@@ sible - &gt; screen photo ... selected . a window appears in which you can adjust the different screen screens :
select the complete Desktop , in order to read a single window under the mouse .
if all your own program window is selected , the call program will disappear , so that you can read other screens and windows . otherwise , you will read the entire work in mind if you read the entire work desk only under the mouse .
the delay determines how long screens will wait before it starts . if you have to switch to other work@@ places , you should select this delay in high enough to navigate the time to navigate there .
after the screenshot photo set out , the dialog options of the target image with the above described above .

the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization allows GPS coordinates to add and edit in the met@@ ad@@ ata of a picture and the geographical data will be stored in the EX@@ IF file and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization provides tools for geograph@@ ically in the spher@@ ical coordination system that is used by GPS and Galileo will be used to loc@@ alize . height , length and lat@@ itud@@ inal values are used .
in order to cor@@ dial your pictures with geographical data , you need a GPS trace as XML file in the GP@@ X format . g@@ p@@ sb@@ abel and g@@ p@@ sman allows you to download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ograph@@ ical loc@@ alization Cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can result in a number of selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . the above @-@ looking dialog appears to invite you to download a possible correlation with GP@@ X file . this file contains of course the data collected at the same time as the images of your camera .
if the file is loaded , there is a automatic correlation , which shows the coordinates in red . GPS trace data are recorded in GMT time and therefore must be converted to GMT . this can be done with time zone . please place your camera zone .
setting for the maximum time deviation is a maximum deviation for GPS time and camera weight . the deviation is below . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you have no trace data from one place for images you can manually edit the GP@@ X file and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then be cor@@ related all images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ate and difference in min. can be used if you don &apos;t know any matching data . if you know that in reality a location in a large time difference between camera and GPS , you can set this bound@@ aries here and then press the button .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have a number of photos at the same place . since the dialog box will need to use the button OK to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found with the shown map and enlarge it . in addition , select the relevant region and enlarge you . the height must always be selected manually . the card can always be selected manually . the card can be exchanged between card mode , satellite images and mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are ways to hang the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool uses to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums to a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.0@@ 1 . you can select the albums in HTML pages and enter the parameters for the HTML page . the character set is encoded as UTF @-@ 8 encoding an order international@@ ization .
the module has four riders in which the settings can be adjusted . you need to select all albums after HTML . you will need to select this albums . with the three buttons on the right side you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , the alp@@ habet and text of the HTML page will appear on the right side .
the rider appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each side . this rider is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . if you click on a picture , a new page is opened on the picture . otherwise , the picture will appear directly with your standard viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show , displayed
the rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery shall be stored with all your corresponding images . choose a folder from which you have write permission . a sub @-@ folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export , which contains everything will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information can also be stored in the new pictures .
with other colour depth , you can change the standard color depth . the size of course also influences the file size . all other settings are declared themselves .
the rider &apos;s rider allows you to view some of the settings from the album rider for the preview pictures , that are small pictures showing the gallery displayed in the gallery .
a progress window displays the user how far the action is . press off to break off the process .
if the module produces the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore check the programs automatically during the creation . the web browser is automatically launched at the end to view the preview of the gallery . press closing the module to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer allows you to view a selection of pictures and to perform basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming , or shift . the viewer can be used with short @-@ commands and re @-@ use . it has been developed for quick overview and quick access to his functions .
after the start , a picture will be displayed as standard in screen mode . this can be changed into window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG L@@ oss@@ less module is a tool to change images without sacrific@@ ing your quality .
this module allows to save images in JPEG format below , without the usual losses of quality and met@@ ad@@ ata .
the consequence of los@@ s@@ less storage is that the file size increases , since no compression of the color information is taking place . this can also be found in PNG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool to connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module is currently no documentation . if you are interested in writing , please contact the ma@@ iling list of K@@ IP@@ I teams under k@@ de @-@ im@@ aging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g . attention : the participants of this list speak English .

with the import function of met@@ ad@@ ata module , you can copy data from one image to another . then select the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the image file , so the image to which you want to copy the met@@ ad@@ ata . the data will be copied to the button OK .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere but not to write in any target format . JPEG is written in writing . please refer to iv@@ 2 to see what formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG encoding module is a tool to convert a series of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide Show .
the MPEG encoding module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video with a defined length . this module uses the packages of M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick . between the individual images you can add a base image file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of Di@@ asch@@ au .
all images will be sc@@ aled automatically to the correct size for the selected video format . in addition , you can choose the formats DVD / X@@ VCD / SV@@ CD / VCD for your DVD players . to burn the media you can only use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you must first choose the images that will be packed into the m@@ peg t@@ asch@@ au . after that , you can create the module via ex@@ tras MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au .
the images selected by you are then below picture files in the portfolio . there you can also change the photos or contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should select the other settings . the video format can choose from various formats , DVD , X@@ VCD , SV@@ CD and VCD . if you plan to select the file on a TV , you must default the corresponding TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pre@@ set and most probably the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds . the speed of the image will be specified below . a lower value generated very sudden , a high brightness is very smooth .
the background color can be set as next . in doubt you should set them black . the name and path of the created file can be found under name of the MPEG @-@ output file . keep the extension mp@@ g as possible .
if you have an audio file in the name of the audio source file , then you can begin with the button . after all the settings of your computer , you can quickly drink the production of your computer . depending on the speed of your computer you can quickly and enjoy a coffee in all the rest when you return back .
if a hint appears that Ko@@ cher or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick packages to the right below .
the print assistant allows several pictures to print together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.g. a sense to improve or print out with the Gim@@ p module for direct expression .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import your images stored in the RAW format in one of three formats to JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ c@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original box of Him is : expect of d@@ cra@@ w not that it creates the same results as the software from your camera manufacturers . sometimes you get better results with d@@ c@@ w better results ! .
first , select the raw file that will be converted to and launch the module . the R@@ aw image window appears then in mode for a single picture . with the button preview you can preview the effect of your current settings .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conver@@ sions process . the first option decides , whether the camera settings can be used for the white @-@ equal values . however , the basic parameters such as Gamma , brightness and Red / blue amplifier can be adjusted . if the result isn &apos;t optimal , you can further edit the picture later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected to use the contrast information . if your camera operates in RGB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switch has no effect .
as soon as you are satisfied with the preview , you can select one of the three output formats and the conversion result is equal to and only the extension is adapted accordingly . JPEG uses a reliable algorithm and produces the smallest file size .
the tagged image format , TIFF , ret@@ ains all information about your image and uses the loss free L@@ Z@@ W compression .
if you are frequently asked to edit your images or later , you should not select the JPEG format , since it is only a limited number of operations before the image quality deterior@@ ated . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you are using JPEG format , the met@@ ad@@ ata that are contained in the raw file are stored in the JPEG file in the EX@@ IF .
if you have adapted your settings , you can start the conversion button . if you want to break this process , you can stop it off .
the st@@ acker processing mode allows you to convert various pictures at one time . therefore , use this mode if you are sure , for example , by testing on a single picture which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for single pictures . however , this is helpful if these were produced in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all pictures in an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ aming all images of a album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the file .
this module can be used to change the size of several images from a image collection . it uses the image program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can reduced the image or enlarge it into four types of image changes :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is automatically selected depending on the image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 ) : size change in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option to adapt your image to screen size .
not proportional : proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio will be changed in this option .
print preparation : preparing the picture for the photo print . the user can set the printing resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target picture , including background size , mar@@ g@@ size and background color , is accordingly adapted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your favorite e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the connected images in advance . further images can go on the list of linked images and place there .
after which you started the module , the pictures window with the displayed images displayed . on the button images you can add more images to a file selection dialog . for the most recently selected image will preview a preview of the right page .
you can also drag the images to the picture list and add it to the list of the p@@ ic p@@ ics you list .
with the button pictures , you will remove the selected pictures from the list below the p@@ ic pictures .
once you have selected all the photos , you can open the new message of your e @-@ mail clients . you only have to add the addresses and subject to the subject . the images are attached to you as an app@@ endix .
do not pay attention to many pictures at once . most email accounts have restrictions on the size of the e @-@ mails . it is possibly a good idea to send several mails if you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the pictures . their configuration is stored and every time you will change until you change it .
select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you have to specify the right path for your installation .
if you use the Google Mail service , you must install previously the GM@@ ail@@ agent on your computer . you can download this here .
after the selection of comments in an attached file the comments are added to the images in a text file and added the mail .
the PNG format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo@@ files , but it is best adapted under the los@@ s@@ less formats like TIFF . you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality is not changed . otherwise we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG pictures file format and the original files are added in JPEG format , then the original exit data will be added to the connected images .
when the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically so that you can view the status messages when searching for errors , but your e @-@ mail program will automatically start at the end . with the button closure , you can sch@@ lie this window ? EN .
after starting the Modul@@ s advanced Di@@ asch@@ au , a window with questions like you want to see your Di@@ asch@@ au . you can select between the selected and all images of the album .
the Open@@ GL @-@ Transmission option in the presentation will use very elegant image trans@@ itions by Open@@ GL . however , you have to own a corresponding graphics card since otherwise the Di@@ asch@@ au will be very slow .
the option file names ensures that the fil@@ en@@ ame of pictures in the left lower corner during the presentation is displayed .
the loop loop ensures that the presentation in a final loop is displayed . you can then take it manually with Es@@ c .
the option images random@@ ly chose the images displayed in random sequence . so it is not used the sequence of pictures in the album .
in delay between the images can be set between the individual images . 1500 mill@@ ise@@ con@@ ds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effects . you should always be able to show your friends !
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly cho@@ oses a different transition between the images .
during the slide show you can access a tool@@ bar at the upper left screen edge . move the mouse in this corner to switch off .
with this tool bar , you can start presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the sealing .
on the left bottom of the screen you can see the current file names , the position of the current image and the total number of images displayed in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; dates are currently no documentation . if you are interested in writing , please contact the ma@@ iling list of K@@ IP@@ I teams under k@@ de @-@ im@@ aging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g . attention : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module is a tool to set a picture as a background for the working surface .
this module sets up the current picture , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu as background for your K@@ DE work@@ surface .
once you have provided your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations , you can see with &amp; Live album ; through this brow@@ sen , see picture . as you can see by comparison with the picture , you are in any group , thus in persons , places and in the group &apos;s keywords .
in the browser window you can see the categories you have entered when you have entered your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in addition there are entries to look at the EX@@ IF @-@ based information , and of course the current images to look at . in the following will be described for itself .
if you press the mouse on the entry , change the browser &apos;s view . see picture .
if you select a further person to select only the pictures are displayed on which both persons are visible . through this selection method you can restri@@ ct the number of the displayed images of a few thousand images on a few individual pictures .
if you have selected all the persons , places and other settings , you can view images with preview images to view the images of your workplace .
in the picture , each person has the same icon in front of its name . however , you can save and save his own album ; however , it is also true for any person , keywords and other categories you have defined themselves . see this picture .
to view images next to the name , select the button that you want to adjust right outside on the tool@@ bar . please note that you can view the view for each category . this has the advantage that you can view the view for each category ( if you have a list of key@@ words with pictures of people and simultaneously ) .
however , you must set ourselves that image can be displayed for each individual person . in order to do this , you will need to select the picture @-@ saf@@ ts window ( in closer ) and select the image editor to suit your desired person . in the box window , you can choose the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and therefore choose which portion of the image is displayed or cut off .
if you are searching for searching for searching , a dialog will appear , which is very similar to the dialog for the fixed of the image characteristics . this dialog can view it once again .
if you enter a character sequence to the box type or description , the label will be searched for this text . if you want , you can also be a Date , i.e. , for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window you can search for all images according to specific names , as you can see in the picture . here , on pictures , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted .
this is the User &apos;s book for &amp; Live album ; if you don &apos;t like to read hand@@ books but rather just try to test functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the Homepage of &amp; Live Album ; and watch the quick entry , the screen photos and introduc@@ tory videos .
start &amp; boot album ; and select the demo , in the first dialog , and choose the menu entry to the menu entry , or choose the menu entry into the menu entry . then some sample images are loaded and you can test the features of &amp; col@@ der album ; try out .
if you prefer to print out this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; Live Album ; as a related HTML document to download .
at the bottom edge of the main window of &amp; none album ; you see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this vest you see here : . as the name suggests , this l@@ ste shows you date @-@ statistics on the pictures in your database .
the time bar can display several different time units . each Lei@@ ste shows a different unit . you can switch between the units of years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by making the bar only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the time bar can be used on the following ways : you can change the displayed preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image will be displayed in preview ) and also shows the current date of the currently displayed images , if you navigate in preview view .
you can also select a range of time bar by pressing the mouse button and select the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , so the time data will be displayed in preview view only images of this period . you can pick up the selection by clicking on a bar of the time bar .
&amp; Xen@@ ical album ; presents two options available to create HTML pages with your pictures . it is integrated in &amp; k@@ ina album ; integrated and the other than module is available ( see ) . in the following part of the user interface , integrated version can be created using the file HTML ... instantly .
before HTML pages you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas contents , layout and target . in the following , any area will be accurate .
first enter the title of the review and a description which should contain the HTML file later . on the whole album ; HTML example pages see an example of this settings .
next , you choose whether a &amp; no album ; -@@ export file is to be displayed on the view page . ferry information about Export files you can find in .
last you can choose which information can be displayed on the HTML pages . for example , you can avoid that information is obvious . for example , you can &apos;t use all pictures of a party . note that &amp; none of the pictures are exported . you can therefore not use this setting to hide specific images from specific viewing lights .
in this area you can determine how the HTML pages should look like . most influ@@ encing options are clearly , which is not to be made specifically for this .
at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . this enables those to watch your website and supports a monitor using the maximum resolution of 800x600 , for example , for example , a resolution of 1600@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer can change your page at any time . it can therefore change your images with low resolution , resulting in a lower transmission time , browse . if he wants to get a picture larger , he changes to higher resolution .
in this setting range , place the different folders and URL where your website is stored .
most of your HTML files select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new sub @-@ folder for each subsequent set .
first you need to select the main folder where all your images are stored . this folder will be stored and automatically adds to the storage location for all future pictures . here you can select either a folder or a file by K@@ DE supported protocol , for example :
after you have created your pictures , you can check this really all for viewer values . if you have created a web browser after the pages have been created , the URL you should set up here should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser should start in the wrong folder .
if the files created by you are not in the final destination file , you have to copy them manually . so the import function will then need to specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub @-@ folder of the current files , but the basic file in which all sub @-@ folders are located .
the currently described positions have been related to all three of the base folders or UR@@ Ls . in these , a sub @-@ folder created , whose name is specified in the output folder .
if you &apos;re looking forward to a family party , a conference or somewhere else , with other users from &amp; k@@ not@@ ch , you may have to put up your pictures with these pictures . if you &apos;re already looking for a much time to viewing the images . if you &apos;re already very much time , you &apos;ll have to reach the pictures , recording location , etc . , then you have to do with &amp; # 1 album ; this job will not be done once again .
with &amp; Xen@@ ical album ; you can export a copy of your pictures into a .@@ k@@ im file . you can import them to your database . the images are imported with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . you distinguish themselves , whether the images can be stored in the file or whether they can easily pass all pictures in the file , so that you can keep all pictures in the file , but the file size is obvious , however , the file size is obvious .
you can export a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the menu file ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with a HTML file , this will create an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file is looking for the pictures on two times . first sear@@ ches the images taken in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . the images of the URL that you have stated when creating the HTML files , this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export .
the following will be described in the dialog for Export images , which you exp@@ orting the menu file ...
the most important option of this dialog box is whether to act internal or external .@@ k@@ im files , the following three selection options are available :
with the Manu@@ ally option to copy the .@@ k@@ im file , you have to copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with this option , configur@@ ing the .@@ k@@ im file , copied &amp; Xen@@ ical album ; the images are automatically deleted for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . because most pictures have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is normally not to comp@@ ress the files . if you want this , simply select the Export File .
the last option of this page is maximum image size limit . if you send to your friends p@@ ics , you would like to limit the images not very large . here you can limit the size that each image should say that each picture should be 800 pixels high and wide .
if you want to select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file Import ... select &amp; C Album ; the exported database as described in described .
the assistant to import@@ ing consists of four steps . first you need to select which images you want to import them , then , in which folders they will be copied to import images .
it may be that you are the category people of the imported file pers@@ oner ( if you are a sw@@ ans ) , while this category is asked for your database persons . therefore , you will be asked to imported the categories of imported file in the third dialog box and to what are these categories in your database .
in the fourth step you can compare the categories of the imported file with the categories of your current database . for example , please see on the picture .
it simply needs to be nice to browse pictures and view : if you see images often , you want to view images of your Italy vacation , and you would like to discover pictures of your Italy vacation , and you might want to see all pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this hand@@ book you will find the different steps from ( 1 ) finding the information about your pictures , via ( 2 ) viewing and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and adjustment options .
K@@ Phot@@ o@@ album was created as a program for managing your pictures . but it was expanded and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this hand@@ book it has been spoken about pictures , but often also closed videos with one .
&amp; Xen@@ ical album ; stores all its information in the inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml file in the top file of their images . it is a simple XML file that you can copy with a program of your choice , e.g. Normal backup tools , to backup to a floppy or re@@ visions in the CV@@ S , where you want .
&amp; Har@@ is Album ; re@@ members the folder where your pictures are stored automatically and uses this when you want to start your pictures . if you want to start another folder with pictures , you can start &amp; browse the album ; with the -@@ c option . as an example : new album -@@ c ~ / company / Picture / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
read more about the menu entry with a photo album ; you can access to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ not album ; in the following section of the user you will be explained in the following section options .
on the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can call on the options and options for the viewer . for each setup , a detailed help is available , which you can call the F1 key to the F1 key and click on the desired option .
it was described as you can set different properties for each picture , e.g. people , places and tags . you can also create your own groups such as items , animals or albums .
on see the dialog that is used to process already existing groups . for any existing group you can select a label and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories were mentioned already . in the dialog options you can setup complete membership groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a half @-@ member as explained in .
in view the setup possibilities you can select to the list of the member groups . with the top choices list , select the category you want to configure . in the left window there is a list of current categories and in the right below a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; Xen@@ ical album ; spl@@ its his modular system with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ K@@ am and g@@ wen@@ view . this modular system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image plug@@ in Interface . can be found on the homepage of K@@ ip@@ i .
the modules can be called via the menu modules . the modules can &apos;t be described in this manual , since they are not part of &amp; none album ; however , most modules have a help side , which you can call via the modules .
since the modules of several applications can be used together , it can be that the modules have been tested together with the demo database , before you can call it on your own pictures . demo @-@ database can you call either via the command line with the command &gt; button &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu help . don &apos;t say , I would not have been warned !
the applications that use the modules about K@@ IP@@ I , are very different , so it can be that some modules with &amp; col@@ der album ; not work . this is the dis@@ advantage if you divide functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; compact album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications can use their images in albums . even if &amp; no album ; this type of order is not supported , it sim@@ ulates the order for some modules , so that you can use the functions with &amp; Xen@@ ical album .
sim@@ ulates &amp; compact album ; the current album that is easy to monitor the current screen , so all photos that show you the picture preview now .
besides the current album &amp; col@@ li@@ c album ; the modules are also handed over a list of albums . here you can find &amp; Xen@@ ical album ; as follows :
if &amp; no album ; s browser indicates the contents of a category , for example , all persons , then each record presents a record for the module .
or it will be the category that you have set up in the dialog for virtual albums . for example , if you &apos;re using the category people , &amp; do the album ; so , if you would have selected people to view and proceed to the module .
since some modules with &amp; B album ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the setup dialog and select the modules installed which modules are loaded .
on the picture you can see an example for a start screen , as soon as you start &amp; talk with your own pictures .
as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you can see the menu and a tool@@ bar . at the moment you can see the window that you have entered your image . in this section we will not appear on this window , and now click on the entry pictures , which shows you an overview with all existing pictures .
one of the main features of &amp; none album ; is the opportunity to see each picture with remarks , where the image has been recorded , where the image has been recorded individually or for a bigger number of images certain notes simultaneously . if for example , on all images of Jes@@ per and all pictures were recorded in Copenhagen .
all these comments may be used for searching and Brow@@ sen , as you can read in the section . if you want to see these notes when you use the built @-@ in viewer .
in view , you can see three lists with a text box by choosing persons , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; col@@ der album ; because you will always use them again if you enter any more information about your p@@ ics .
the following idea is to move the pictures within the list : if you are looking for example a family party and see on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 people , you can see that the names are shifted upward , which can be found faster and arrange them .
if you prefer to get an alphabetical list of the list , click on the icon for s@@ orting to date below the list .
if you have selected notes for each image , you would like to edit all the selected pictures and have these pictures with remarks . in this case simply click on the right and back buttons that are located under the preview of the image below .
if you have several pictures , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to select all of these pictures and to use the menu item added entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California .
on the picture you can see a browser window that shows the USA as an over@@ group . to view it is a special icon will be displayed on the picture .
in the context menu of the viewer dial@@ ogs it is possible to add an entry to an existing or sub@@ category . additionally , you can also set a record to make this entry into a category . attention , this assumes that you are now alphabet@@ ically sorted your categories .
you can move the individual elements of the feature dial@@ ogs by making the l@@ ath that form the upper edge of the frame , click and move . you can also make a separate window by moving it outside the window .
if you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs , that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the button options ... , which offers you the opportunity to save the current structure and appearance of the window .
you can also release a frame in a frame . if you want to see this window later , use the button options ... and then window a / off . this process can be seen in the picture .
if you select the entry images in the browser , select an overview with preview images of the currently selected pictures , or all images you have no filter . for example , click here . you can configure the size of the images with the middle mouse button , configure . try it simply by simply .
if you use a picture on the background of your desktop , this picture will set up the background for your desktop .
if you have once click on a picture , this image viewer will be displayed . if you have not open a window with a picture viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can easily delete pictures in the picture preview . simply select the corresponding pictures you want to delete or select either the remove button or select the menu icon . now , you will see the window that you can see in the picture .
&amp; Xen@@ ical album , you can use a solution . you can also use &amp; delicious album ; namely images can also use them stored on the hard disk . of course you have to record the images anywhere you can &apos;t have the photos stored in the database . in the picture you can view the view of &amp; Xen@@ ical album ; if not all the required images can be loaded from hard disk .
images , where the right corner is cut , are not stored on the hard disk . for example , the pictures 5 @-@ 9 are available , but you can see the preview pictures ; you can view the preview of these pictures . you can &apos;t view these pictures with the image viewer .
as you can see this function you need to copy files from the folders and to copy it again . if you would like trouble to avoid the question of the relevant CD now , please buy a larger hard drive to store all pictures on it .
in the menu Images you can find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to open a little more privacy , you want to view out the images that you want to see other un@@ accessible menu . alternatively , you can also see all pictures that can see your little sister , and select the menu entry everything except the current view .
thus you have set out what images should be hidden in case of your little sister , simply select the menu entry for your little sister , so select all the pictures you have blocked off . if you want to get the pictures again , click on Sper@@ re .
it is also possible to define a password which must be entered into the lock . in order to create this password , select password change in the menu privacy .
please consider that this image protection must not be sure that you can read all pictures on the hard disk and to the other one can read or delete the password as un@@ coded text or delete . this type of password protection is only used for those who are with &amp; B album ; not very familiar to re@@ ject the view of private pictures .
the reason why you spend all your pictures with &amp; Xen@@ ical album ; manage and check it for hours over time , of course you want to look at some point . from this reason you can view it sometime . from this reason you can view it from the preview , as described in .
the viewer can be seen in . it shows the picture , but additional all the information you have about the image , such as who is on the picture when and where it was done , etc .
if the info box on the upper part of the picture you want to see and anywhere else . you can also configure , which information can be displayed and be displayed at all . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer . the context menu can be seen below .
some words in the Info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here the browser , see , matching entries to this . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you were interested in the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene would have chosen .
if you have several pictures at the viewer , you can jump between them and go back by using the keys image high and picture . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions can also be reached from the context menu .
if several pictures are charged in the viewer , you can run these as Di@@ asch@@ au . &amp; no album ; then load a new image after a few seconds . as often a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l button and plus Min@@ us . started and stopped by the buttons C@@ tr@@ l ; S .
a very useful ability of the viewer &apos;s viewer is used to switch and back in full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer can use the complete square on the screen . simply use the input key to change in full screen mode and back .
if you use the viewer you can simply drag in the image and zoom into the image . with the Min@@ us key you can play back up the Plus button in the middle of the picture . shows how a zoom rectangle is marked and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
using the point button you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the mouse button , the zo@@ oms set the zo@@ oms , so that every pixel corresponds to a pixel of the image .
note that the only zoom operations that work on videos that come in and zo@@ oming with the Plus@@ - and Min@@ ec@@ aste .
with the turning features from the context menu you can rotate the image . you can &apos;t work with videos . you can make remarks on the current image with the menu item notes from the context menu .
if you can view images you can find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture . at the moment you can view the open and configuration dialog of the image to enter this name . however , they will simply drag the picture and consider further images .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures on paper . to see what photos you want to start with images and select it as good or bad you will see one after another .
for the two examples above , the viewer will give you the opportunity to view images with characteristics while you can view it . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature that you push the corresponding letters . in view a picture where the features A , B and C are set .
once you have provided features on your pictures , you can easily print , print , or whatever you have selected , so simply add all of them with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this is described in . thereafter you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or what you want to make .
categories and special features can be displayed in the preview view . if you can view categories in DR@@ E preview view , then you can easily add characteristics to the pictures by simply select the letter for the feature , after the image has been selected . you can see here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case you can draw &amp; free album ; on the picture to paint .
the ground is not saved with the picture but in the database . on the way you can get your roof later .
in you , you can see a picture on the painted site . in order to activate the painting mode of &amp; col@@ der album ; then turn on the picture from the context menu . to stop the painting please press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; you have to have the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; do not have to rule completely , but documentation about &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you be read and understood .
in the slide tree you can choose individual objects . then , their properties in the object properties are displayed and the object is depicted in the wire model views yellow .
you can also select several objects at the same time , but not the subject of an already selected object , since all accommodation are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object in the object @-@ tree , select the position when you want to insert the object , and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu entry .
if there are multiply possible positions , the following hing@@ es can be integrated , so that you can choose the right position :
you can select select selected objects from the scene using the menu bar either from the menu bar or from the context menu of the right mouse button .
if you have changed properties , click to use to use these changes . if you have entered the update , a message with an error description is displayed . then you can re@@ ject the input errors and re@@ ject the changes with it .
if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; please enter the user documentation in the dialog dialog , you can call &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
if you edit a texture or a part of a texture , you can see a preview of the private @-@ list view .
press the overall texture view and a small example of the scene will be selected with the chosen texture . if you want to select an inserted element , even if you want to select a portion of texture ( for example a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , cross the locally .
the screen photo shows the control points of the camera . you can draw these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is chosen , marks the control points and it becomes a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the centre for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shi@@ fts . you can change the shift by pulling with the mouse inside the window .
each object has a visible level of visible object . you can specify this value relative to the visible level of the above object or as an absolute value . objects will be displayed only if they are selected or their visibility level lower or equal to the visual level of the scene .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views are shown on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the default window order , or if you need a different arrangement , you can easily set them anywhere . you can also store multiple windows arrangements and can easily change between different orders .
to em@@ it a window over or below a view , drag the beginner to the upper or bottom edge of a view . a rectangle below shows the new position .
to create a new column , draw the beginner to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then en@@ shr@@ ined on the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you want to arrange several opinions on each other , you draw the beginner to another view . you can then switch between the views through clicking on the card card slot above in the sight .
the last possible shut@@ dow@@ ment are floating views : views , which are not an@@ cho@@ red in the main window . to solve a view out of the anchor , draw the beginner to the desktop or click on the little left at the beginning above left arrow .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the Anf@@ al Bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between arrow and cross .
you can add additional views into the main window . in the menu View , you can find entries for any type of views . new views are floating , you can attach it to any place .
the current window view can store you with view window arrangement ... save . it is displayed a dialog where you can store the window order under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can ren@@ ders . &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; uses &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to ren@@ dering this program was right installed . when this manual was written , it was &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to render the current scene , click on the icon ren@@ dering the icon ren@@ ders in the tool@@ bar or select the menu entry for scene ren@@ ders .
an R@@ ender mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s IN@@ I files . it determines the image size and quality of the ren@@ dering . if you want to insert a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can easily add many R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview of up to full @-@ images in the highest quality .
if you click on the Symbol The R@@ ender settings in the tool@@ bar or in the menu View R@@ ender mode ... select the following dialog :
each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it is a name who can recognize the properties tab for this mode .
in the map size you can present the width and height of the roasted image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the check box below and enter the image section to the input fields .
in the combination field quality , you can choose the features that are using &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; for ren@@ ders . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ use reflection @-@ lighting . an extensive description of the R@@ ender features can be found in the user manual &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
if a picture is rendered by only one pixel per pixel . these pictures often have a mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or tier effects in curves and lines , and they are sometimes not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to decrease the influence of this error . generally , images are better from this feature .
if you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; the second method is adapted @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively , because each pixel is still sub@@ divided and adapted because of the calculations of the calculated color values .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray pursu@@ es a beam per pixel . if the difference between color values would be set out , then both pixels will be adjusted by the persecution of a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you calculate the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 is calculated additionally , with a depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
diff ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays each . if the difference between color values exceeds the pre@@ defined threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixel , which can be controlled individually and on further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of records can be set with the depth value .
another way to decrease the ali@@ asing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process , called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you turn off J@@ itter@@ ing , change &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays of a tiny amount to avoid frequent samples .
the last setting for quality of the ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this is the diff@@ use light reflection . it takes a long to comp@@ ute a scene with this property .
on this map card you can adjust whether the alpha channels are to be calculated using POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the small beams had no object .
opens a new window for displaying &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly , you can find the reason here .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; scene to import , select the menu entry file import@@ ing ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently , &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; yet not the full command @-@ catch of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . when import@@ ing error messages or warning , a dialog window displays a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler , please write this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ end .
you can also draw objects from the object tree into the editor to import the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; to import objects into the editor , select the source text in the editor and draw him in the slide tree .
with copying and insertion in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; and in your Editor you can add source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also included .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called , if &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this p@@ ov@@ ray or x @-@ p@@ ov@@ ray .
if you click on the help in their own @-@ based view , &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . set the path to your documentation and the version . it supports versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; search for external files ( for example height mil@@ king data ) in the path to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you enter files not in the folder of the scene , you have to present the path to these files here . if a file specified in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the colour of the rectangle for the view field in the camera view and in the windows type label .
you can set the object &apos;s object in the context menu of the open context menu . you can set the grid separately for shi@@ fts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations .
larger values give you a more accurate wire model and therefore a better stress for the displayed objects , but require more time to ren@@ dering . for some objects like the sphere , you can adjust the detail level for two directions .
if you cross high detailed proj@@ ections for extended proj@@ ections , all wire views are further divided , when the camera uses an extended projection , with exceptions from perspective and vertical proj@@ ections . this property makes a better rap@@ proch@@ ement for the proj@@ ections , but requires more time to ren@@ dering .
when you cross a wall , a wall is placed behind the objects . the wall is displayed in a box pattern with two adjustable colors .
when you cross the floor , a bottom is placed below the objects . the floor is displayed in a box pattern with two adjustable colors .
when you cross the edge of edge , non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used . the values for depth and sw@@ elling can be set . more precise information on the parameters can be found in the R@@ ender mode .
on this site you can change or replace new window arrangements . in the window arrangements , it will explain how you can use window arrangements .
the Combin@@ ation field Standard Window System : shows all existing window arrangements . &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; the chosen window is used during the start of the program .
the Mis@@ cellaneous window displays shows all existing window arrangements . a new arrangement allows you to add and delete a selected arrangement with the button .
any type of window is identified by the name . the name must be clear and cannot be empty .
the list below the name shows all views for the chosen Window . new views can add to the button add and remove selected views with the button .
the position of the new window . with the new column you create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with un@@ lock windows , you will receive a map card view together with the previous view and suspended the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you have just &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; installed and now you would like to follow without more precise knowledge of both programs . if you follow all steps in this tutorial , you should make the ultimate race very popular : one ball on a plane .
but you should keep following warning messages before you compl@@ ain about that you can get as a result only a black screen . if you use a 3D program , you should note these important rules :
if you don &apos;t adjust the camera , no rules can be applied to the ren@@ dering , as a result , get a black p@@ ic .
if you do not include light sources , your whole scene lies in the dark and you will receive only a black picture .
if you have any Error @-@ free , see the first start from &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; the following pre @-@ installed window scheme :
take a little time to get the menus and the existing symbols of the tool bar . read the documentation to allow you to get a reasonable presentation of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols to be frequently used , so you should notice the menus and symbols and their applications .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; starts with a simple scene . in order to follow these steps , you need to remove all objects from the slide tree . select the scene and then select the menu entry . thus you have a scene without objects .
the wire Model View shows how the camera shows the whole scene what you generate . in particular note that in the fourth wireless model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the view@@ point of the camera . this is the result of the ren@@ dering of the scene .
the slide tree now contains a new entry containing the name camera . if they click on it , check the contents of view object properties , where the various parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation on &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; find further details .
do not change anything to the basic settings of the camera , but note that you can change the camera in view control points , with which you can change the target point of the camera . just click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired position .
if you press the button user or the input , change the wire @-@ level views and the slide tree immediately after this settings . as a result , they see here the scene from the view@@ point of the camera .
there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . you might set a qu@@ ader ( insertion body qu@@ ader ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a controversi@@ al method for the solution of this task .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; actually offers a simpler option . you can use an infinite plane as a floor :
a good advice : select the plain in the object tree , change the name and press the button user or the intervention . in the slide tree , the new name is now displayed immediately .
the Wireless Adapter view now shows the level even though at the moment only as a limited level . if you render the scene , the plane stretches out to the horizon .
if you can view the object tree exactly , you &apos;ll notice that you can click on the icon + before the object . in this case you will find only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . choose one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of object properties .
in this scene , you should move the soil to exercise a unit under the horizontal line , just in order to know some of these parameters . select shi@@ fting and set the values as follows :
first choose the floor to set up its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose a bit Easy at the moment .
in both cases , a dialog where you can choose to choose how the object should be inserted . please choose the name in the property view ( name = soil pigment ) , with one click on the button preview , like the pigment now looks .
of course , the preview of pigments just shows a matt black material because you can check the appearance of materials anytime from any time with a click on preview . also there are plenty of options now , but you can now take the easiest way .
if you don &apos;t see a color on Qu@@ ader and ball , click on the button to push the button and then call the preview .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you hit your image now with one click on the icon , you should get the following result :
of course you don &apos;t have the colour ben@@ ches . in the color list you have to enter two new attributes . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this also more frequently , but the Schach@@ brett @-@ color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the slides , select the colors in the slides and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
you should already simply execute this step since you have already understood the basic work of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; the ball can be just as simple as the floor :
in the view of object properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( don &apos;t forget to push the input button or the button to press ) , so the sphere is floating on the ground as you shifted the bottom to bottom .
of course , the ren@@ dering now gives a sel@@ enium result : as already before , the pu@@ ffer appears like a matt black material . set in the following step an appropriate material .
if you have chosen the ball , you can now assign a material now . as already on the floor , enter the sphere of a pigment as color :
choose an object subject and change the name for example in sphere of pigments . click on the sphere of pigments , select one color and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve even more interesting effects if you take time to adjust some finish properties :
change the values as in the following screen photos and click on user or press the input button .
the settings of shine @-@ effect and reflection have already shown good visual effects , perfect for glass or chromium @-@ plated surfaces , even if met@@ ic : not even selected :
you should now have a good impression of it which offers you &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler . hop@@ efully you have already learned as much as you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ ing is a R@@ ender approach to generate a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
if you ra@@ ke a scene of hypo@@ thet@@ ical rays from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that reflected the scenes ) through each pixel by the objects , the visual effects of light sources reflected in the scene and how atmospheric effects can result in such as an atmospheric effects of m@@ ist . this will be the scene of pixels for pixels .
as you can imagine , you will not see without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you see the scene . without a light source , you see nothing , the picture is simply black . obviously , any scene need to be taken , some light sources and at least one camera .
in usual file dialog you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
open a file . in default file dialog you can select a file that you have previously created with &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ;
whenever you open a new model or create , the file is inserted into this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you are already saved the model , it will be saved under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and disk space .
represents the scene recovered in the last stored version . all changes since the last storage is rejected .
you can only choose this menu entry only if you have not saved saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last command . repeat this menu entry only if you use it on the paths .
stores the current window conditions and opens a dialog where you can type a name for a new configuration or over@@ write an existing arrangement .
in this menu , you can find options for setting &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; , here you can change the appearance , the keyboard cut and the default behavior .
opens a dialog for changing the keyboard short@@ age . you can change or add new commands to this option for &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler with this option .
opens up a dialog for setting up the tool . you can add and remove any tool symbols for &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler with this option .
a B@@ ump @-@ Map is a way to provide rough surfaces without changing any hi@@ ves on the surface without changing without the geomet@@ ric shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file both for a B@@ ump @-@ map as well as for a texture map .
basic body are simple geomet@@ ric shapes that you can use as blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens of or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then further processed to give them a realistic appearance .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object colour based on pixel basis , using an image file as a colour card .
&amp; ku@@ d show ; is a comfortable picture viewer and browser . the application features a file browser where you can select pictures for display .

the D@@ COP @-@ interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions that are mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and should describe the D@@ COP functions of collection , context @-@ browser , player , playlist , playlist , playlist and scripts . a sample call for the D@@ COP @-@ function could cause &amp; z@@ b ; look like :
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; Amar@@ ok still has some own command line options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script may not run because of a lack of depen@@ dency . please check in your script if all the required modules are present and use k@@ dialog , so the user does not running a script .
Beg@@ in require &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE Bin@@ dings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings V@@ 3.4 is -@@ for this script . &apos; the dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit
in the scripts / templates you can find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use it as a basis for your own scripts , or simply expand the required functions . you &apos;ll quickly find that the script is relatively easy .
with the help of D@@ COP , your scripts can be exchanged with Amar@@ ok and Amar@@ ok . the sim@@ pl@@ est way is the use of command d@@ co@@ p ; whereby each K@@ DE installation should be carried out .
most scripts said the result of external programmes and commands . this way , the function ex@@ ec ( ) is used . this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easy . here &apos;s an example in Python :
&amp; am@@ arok ; sends messages to all current scripts . for this reason strings are written to the standard entry of the script . for this reason , scripts might want to monitor its standard entry and react correspon@@ d@@ ingly to events . of course , a script can also ignore the events if it does not use it .
configure the script to display the dialog dialog . in order to save and loading the setup data , Amar@@ ok will start the working folder on the folder where all data should be stored .
track@@ Change that a new piece is played . the script could now be &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ COP @-@ features you can query further information about the new piece ( for example the met@@ ad@@ ata or the unit length ) .
volume change new@@ volume signals a change of the volume . the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ ise Men@@ u@@ cli@@ cked : Sub@@ st@@ it@@ em@@ Title : contains the path to select the selected menu entry , if a custom menu entry can also be handed out . in order to add an own entry , you can use the D@@ COP @-@ function d@@ co@@ p am@@ arok script add@@ alena Men@@ u@@ Item ( Sub@@ st@@ it@@ em@@ edia ) . to remove one entry you can use d@@ co@@ p am@@ arok script - e@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Item ( Sub@@ st@@ it@@ em@@ Title ) .
before &amp; am@@ arok branches ; or if the user stops a script , sends &amp; am@@ arok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed , for example , storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ oks Script administration can also install script pack@@ ets , which can also be compressed using b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ t@@ ar ) , which can optionally be identified with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , so that the user can clearly recognize the archive as a Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; am@@ arok ; 1.3 will accept only script pack@@ ets with the wid@@ get amar@@ voc@@ al script . for this reason , you should ren@@ ame your script packages equal to correctly .
the main thing must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining memory modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter to obtain the file &apos;s right :
if your script package is ready , you can upload it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and put the link to the Wik@@ i scripts page of &amp; am@@ arok ; put on your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category am@@ arok ; scripts .

if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa @-@ S@@ ink , the device must use a bl@@ ender . a bl@@ ender allows for several applications to use the device at the same time and via the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software mixer ) . take a look at the Help D@@ mix for AL@@ SA .
the output of this command should help you with the problem of problems and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you need to specify a different sink . ( for example flat sink ) .
doing &amp; am@@ arok ; already . don &apos;t forget that media must first de@@ coded . you can only find a white noise . G@@ stre@@ amer is ideal for most people the best choice if you read a dec@@ or with little overhead . G@@ stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ coded them and sends the PCM data to AL@@ SA . exactly like X@@ M@@ MS .
even X@@ M@@ MS de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer may output directly to AL@@ SA as well as x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer Dri@@ vers ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open your sound server with highest possible priority ( real @-@ time pri@@ or@@ ity ) and increase the size of sound buffer ( warning , see the next point of the FAQ ! ) . ensure that art@@ is@@ hi@@ ps SU@@ ID is set to :
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia Code@@ cs , which may cause the sound reproduction . read this error report . the Enlarge of the sound buffer file in your AL@@ SA entry file .@@ as@@ oun@@ dr@@ c can also help well .
either use the Arts drivers but instead of G@@ stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia complete to get the faster Arts co@@ de@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably use the Arts driver . use a different driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buff@@ ers in the control centre and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less mot@@ ions react to the visu@@ al@@ izations . yes , this is an error , please help us to fix it .
G@@ stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to change to G@@ stre@@ amer driver , crash@@ es &amp; am@@ arok branches ; why ?
after installation of G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all components . run G@@ ST register to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask in the I@@ RC channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
try this ( termin@@ ate am@@ aro@@ K previously ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg files , comp@@ ile and install it . then you will find the G@@ ST register now as a system administrator , and once you can use G@@ ST folder ( you will find the module folder with G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ amer @-@ config ) and run G@@ ST regi@@ sters . launch now &amp; am@@ arok ; .

now I have &amp; am@@ arok ; new installed , but the output modules appear still not yet . and now ?
probably , use a distribution to install the development files from the actual program installed . although G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , the necessary developers must install . the same applies to x@@ ine , you must install x@@ ine @-@ dev@@ el . after that you have to re @-@ comp@@ ile and install it again .

I have a second sound@@ card and use AL@@ SA . how can use am@@ aro@@ K use the second sound card ?
set the device under Settings ... Audio Output to set up the device . typically , HW : 0 for the standard sound card and HW : 1 for the second .
here you can see an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ oun@@ dr@@ c on a machine with a onboard AC@@ 97 codec and a USB audio device :

enter the setup dialog of x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio , and the output takes place on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib takes care of the conversion of sampling rates , channels , and so on .
if you want to use a virtual mix @-@ mix , activate the tick with sound card .

V@@ CD@@ Im@@ ager : one of the functional scope of fully equipped car system to edit , dis@@ assembling and analyze video CDs and super video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool will be useful for adjusting the volume of music files to a standard stage . this can be useful for creating a mixed CD &apos;s and Mp3 collections ; without normal@@ ize , the different recording of the various albums can lead to the un@@ beautiful effect that the music pieces can be recovered differently .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : here it is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically playback any videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way , recently opened projects again . the associated sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click brings up the project .
stores the current project . if the project was already saved once , the previously created file will be asked , otherwise it is asked after a new file name .
stores the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ames . K@@ DE &apos;s Dialog Save under is displayed , with which you can choose folders and file name for the repository .
stores all open projects . this is the same as you would save for each individual project file .
closes the current project . if a project has changed and not yet saved , asks &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after what should happen . you can then take between Save and Chang@@ es . in addition , you can also break down and keep the project so open .
includes all open projects . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for any stored project , what should happen that , just as would you have called for each project file .
includes all open projects and ends &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for any stored project will be asked , as if you have called file closing .
if you call this entry , you can select via the publication dialog for Adding the Project . that &apos;s the same effect when you come out the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the so added files will appear in the base folder of the CD .
opens the dialog box for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the properties dialog for the Project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for burning the media , it can only be opened when the project does already contain data .
opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project settings . every project type has different possible settings , most of them are described ? help ( reachable via the right mouse button ) .
this entry appears only in an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this is useful if you &apos;re not used for a multi@@ multi@@ session CD . the data of the previous session will always be used , even if this function is not used , so that you can see the files available on the medium already existing files and folders .
this entry appears only in an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function removed no files from the medium , it &apos;s only the previously imported files from imported files .
opens the CD Copy dialog . this also allows you to create a CD from a CD on a different medium . alternatively , you can also copy only a copy of a CD , which you would also prefer to copy it later . you should also prefer Cl@@ one if you want to copy CDs with def@@ ective sectors or video CDs .
opens the DVD copying dialog . this also allows you to create a copy of a DVD on a different medium . alternatively , you can also only support a copy of a DVD with the help of copying dialogue . therefore , there is also that destination media must be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source media in the original form .
opens the dialog for del@@ eting a CD @-@ RW . thus you can delete all contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
opens the dialog for the form@@ att@@ ing of a DVD . with this dialogue , you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) format , which the contents will be completely deleted . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; you can choose between the typ@@ ho@@ odes over@@ write and incre@@ ment@@ ell .
bur@@ ns a previously created CD image . the dialog asks for a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source that can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you need to use other tools such as Nr@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
bur@@ ns a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks for a * .@@ is@@ o file as a data source , which can be burned immediately by pressing the burning button .
a previously used DVD video may be converted . this dialog window will usually appear after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used extensively . it contains information about the le@@ aded video , code settings and even possibilities to change the size and cut black edges .
displays information about the inserted medium . these information are displayed in the content view and include properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
displays a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; when one entry is crossed , the tool bar is presently visible in the main window .
when this is crossed , a small l@@ ath at the bottom of the window will be displayed . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is b@@ lown up .
when the folder view is a or off . the folder view includes an overview of your folder and CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , their content is displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with features such as media information , lock and lock of the drive or throw out of the medium .
the site view switches or off . the content view allows to select and pulling the files into the project view . the content can also be selected to read audio or video CDs if a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD was chosen in the folder view .
the head rests in the project view a or from . the head is a narrow area that contains only visible when the project has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the remaining views .
this will open a dialog for changing the key@@ boards for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part you can adjust the key order down below .
this will start K@@ 3@@ b ; integration assist@@ ants . thus , the correct per@@ missions can be set to burn CDs and DVDs . instead , system administrator privileg@@ es need to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) .
opens the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; here you can do general program settings . almost all the functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; should work on An@@ h@@ ie@@ b . this dialogue is intended for personal@@ ize and fine tuning of the program .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is how many other &amp; k@@ art ; applications are also equipped with a &amp; D@@ COP ; interface equipped . using this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a Sh@@ ell@@ scriptions .
to use &amp; D@@ COP ; -@@ functions can use , you can either use the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or the somewhat more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in functional scope , therefore rather your taste and the type of your task is crucial , which of the programs you will give notice .
in this chapter , we assume that you can use the command line program d@@ co@@ p . in order to use &amp; D@@ COP ; you need to make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b is started ; then enter something like the following on the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ COP ; -@@ functions that have all &amp; k@@ de ; the program supports , supports &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two parts which are described below .
the Standard D@@ COP @-@ interface of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; features features like cop@@ y@@ CD , format DVD and other functions for creating new projects .
D@@ COP@@ Sóller cre@@ at@@ e@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Audio CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Vide@@ vi@@ x@@ DVD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Vide@@ vi@@ x@@ DVD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Vide@@ vi@@ x@@ DVD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Video DVD@@ Project ( ) . cop@@ y@@ C@@ d ( ) . cop@@ y@@ C@@ d ( ) . cop@@ y@@ D@@ vd ( ) , @-@ format D@@ vd ( ) , mis@@ n@@ C@@ d image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) -@@ bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ at@@ e@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you can create a D@@ COP @-@ reference to the newly created project : # K@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project can be obtained via the # d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project . using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ ject@@ interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the top @-@ listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ ject@@ interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Pro@@ ject@@ interface that can only be used on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name ) , cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name , Q@@ String Par@@ ent ) -@@ add@@ ur@@ l ( K@@ URL : : List UR@@ Ls , Q@@ String Par@@ ent ) check@@ box Item ( Q@@ String Quart@@ et , Q@@ String Par@@ ent ) .
so it is possible to fill out a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then add files into the new folder :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b interface , d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT bet@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT bet@@ at@@ e@@ fol@@ p / / fil@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; is an audio CD ; is an audio CD ; it can be read and saved in MP3 or OGG files . other formats are possible , depending on the encoder that installed on the computer .
&amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data files in WAV files on hard drive ) and by many codi@@ les that are encoded for O@@ G@@ Gs and FLA@@ C ( This co@@ ders must still be installed from the Linux distribution ) . further co@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first the title of the &amp; CD ; read out and compressed in WAV files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step this WAV files ( usually one per title ) comp@@ resses into the MP@@ 3- or OGG format or other formats such as los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading &amp; CD ; it is used by &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia uses . almost any distribution has been compiled a pre @-@ compiled package , if this is not installed , it must now be done now .
for the second step , lame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for OGG ) or other Ko@@ eng . all these programs are usually installed for any Linux distri@@ butions , but only the code packages are installed , which will not need to be used . if for example FLA@@ C cannot be used , the installation is not necessary .
what Ko@@ di@@ zer / file format is to be used ? this is a small introduction on Ko@@ di@@ erer , audio quality and quality factors .
a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , uses &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for reading audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not possible to avoid any protected audio CD ; it is not possible to avoid any protected audio CD ; even do not avoid the mechanisms of copying protection . avoid the purchase of copy protected audio CD ; s !
while the setup must be performed only once ( the setup dialog can be called up until a suitable configuration ) , the daily handling of a &amp; CD . this leads to the hard drive . this leads to the slim approach of the user interface , which you will be able to stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert multiple formats - depending on which encoding programs are installed ( MP3 , OGG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b or can work completely without any network , whereby everything is driven manually .
this is just a short list of commands from the main window . on the page step by step , you will find further information about how this program is used as well as screens with descriptions of regi@@ sters for the configuration of the program .
the CD@@ DB file is based on the CD data according to the device CD@@ DB . ( this may be locally or online , in the latter case must first be made to the Internet . )
start reading and - if a encoder is configured in tab settings that was configured in the setup dialog for encoding .
a sub @-@ menu opens with a list of the available Encoder so that the selection with another encoder can be read as default . it is necessary to note that previously the encoder is configured in tab dialog for dialog settings .
opens the file manager so that an already selected file is selected to en@@ code a full &amp; CD ; read and en@@ code your file .
opens the dialog dialog to configure the type of al@@ er@@ ts ( such as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ tics ) for program@@ mers ( as read the &amp; CD ; terminated ) .
opens the main setup dialog for &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; with different cart@@ oning cards ( such as Encoder , to set the En@@ co@@ ders ) . you must go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes sound quality , co@@ axial and compression ratios and helps you to choose from the right code .
if no audio information is lost , there will be a los@@ s@@ less audio format . besides FLA@@ C , there are other like &apos; hormone &apos; or &apos; Monkey &apos; which may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices to play these files .
among the audio formats , the information transmitted via data compression according to their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and OGG are the most common . OGG may have a slight advantage against MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) but above that bit@@ rate the differences are less important , as both co@@ ders will generate very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , lame is still supplied with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license questions
+ high to very high sound quality ( high rates ) but compared with OGG slightly lower quality at lower bit@@ rates .
OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG files is present .
MP3 - If music is also part of other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special car stereo systems . today - initially 2009 - support these devices usually only the MP3 format .
a short list of parameters for the audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; lame &apos; ( MP@@ 3s ) ( see &apos; lame --@@ help &apos; for other parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set medium &apos; = This setting makes good transparency for most people and most of music
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer to most people and most music pieces acceptable transparency , and has quite high quality . good enough for stereo stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; = 224 up to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for stereo stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate approximately 5.5 . needs always 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need c@@ BR@@ s . good enough for stereo stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate about 11 . 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good gen@@ ug to music by young people , portable devices and auto @-@ test@@ ers . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated for most of the people and most of the environments without any back@@ drop to the file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information , which are entered manually or by the program automatically from fre@@ ed@@ b over the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can be delivered / used with &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; and the code program to generate the folder and file names and the characteristics of music files .
in connection with coding programs , there are often a combination of program settings for the encoding and these parameters here . the manual or assistance to the codes explain the switch for these programs .
for example to add the &amp; CD ; title to the key@@ word ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3s with lame are encoded , the switch -@@ tt of lame and the Title Parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; the result looks as follows : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; parameters , which can be used ( = button name in the assistant ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database that can download the information up and enter the information , so that all the other information can be able to enter into the machine : &amp; CD ; Title , Artist , names of the pieces &amp; etc . , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I am not attor@@ ney . however , nobody can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; more or less valuable , thus neither the artist nor the music companies can be added to the music company . all the information can be saved in a B@@ um@@ mel by a &amp; CD ; business , physically or virtualization .
in &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; is active a check box . for use by fre@@ ed@@ b , it can be used with another ( counter@@ f@@ eit ) address when the server is not used . in this type of configuration , it seems , the e @-@ mail address is not used to retri@@ eve the server ( this can only know the programmer that has the code . )
there are many countries copies of the main database . if &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the geographical on the next mirror server is needed . this saves bandwidth in the network and compar@@ es the load between the machines .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ .@@ org delivers a current list of mirror ser@@ ver@@ n for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information while reading a &amp; CD ; . alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually recorded monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which is a reading program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; to store WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to be more precise , search in source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; see note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package has to be installed from the appropriate distribution first if this is not yet done .
to save the read WAV files , the code file can be selected and thus select the file format . during the first opening there are pre@@ defined entries for lame ( MP@@ 3s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab card . other co@@ ders can be added on this tab .
the codi@@ le package needs to be installed from the corresponding Linux distribution prior to the code required . this is also necessary for pre @-@ defined codi@@ le . more information about co@@ ders are in the chapter of Wel@@ cher code .
after installing a codi@@ le you can obtain further information on his switches as lame -@@ help or lame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . thereby &apos; lame &apos; will be replaced by the name of the installed Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers .
that can have many causes . check the device of the device label of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the write and read@@ just@@ ly of your choice ( lame for MP@@ 3s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) . try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal . that could indicate what is wrong .
check if you do not want to read a copy protected audio CD ; check out the shell &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this tips can be specified as you must proceed .
have you read the complete manual , but they are still un@@ certain what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ for @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to establish those ranges that want to make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time to create everything and our first &amp; CD ; we &apos;ll be lame &apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 up to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 key@@ words ( tags ) .
there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and lame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre@@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution as it is considered not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files , which you can always do .
please ensure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and you have write permission to own ( eg ; try to copy with the quer@@ or something into it ) .
the first section covers the basic integration of &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; , something is thought to be done only once and
the second section describes the preview for trig@@ gers a &amp; CD ; which must be repeated for every CD &amp; CD .
here we determine the compression co@@ ders for compression of the music ( lame ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pre@@ set extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 up to 256 k@@ bps ) . since we are la@@ zy to use the program to use the fre@@ ed@@ b to download the &amp; CD ; data from the internet .
even though we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not be able to read any &amp; CD if you &apos;ve found the matching settings .
the device name is handed over to the feedback program to read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces can be read .
frequently is / dev / c@@ drom a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive . if this is not working or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive can also be accessed , so a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the entries available on the device records for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the card card General Settings . here you are not much to do here . here it can be defined as an additional conversion . in our example , everything will be checked / entered as shown in screen photo .
only in case of incomplete information , you will be informed when information regarding the creation of key@@ words ( tags ) are missing .
the cartridge card CD ; default settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the calcul@@ ator must be connected during the release of the &amp; CD ; to be connected to the Internet in order to access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second selection box is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry is found immediately , if you are dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / file names or file names , can be changed easily . the directory or file name is changed using conv@@ ocation - &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , dem &amp; k@@ de ; tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , if you want to enter all manually , activate the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b is not used . however , these more than 620 MB large , consider this twice whether this is worthwhile . in order to use fre@@ ed@@ b in the offset mode , the two selection fields must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following box card .
CD@@ DB is for us fre@@ ed@@ b . these are settings for the data subject , for the call &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data will get the CD ? read the section on fre@@ ed@@ b . set everything as shown in screen photo .
mode : we don &apos;t have downloaded the database , we only want to work with remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ .@@ org and look at a mirror server nearby . on this way the load is distributed between the machines . this setting will however function as the first attempt .
both operate the same as the server , as many Fire@@ walls will boot the protocol 88@@ 80 standard , there may be more luck with the protocol 80 , as the &amp; HTTP ; protocol usually open to surf at the internet .
in this example , we don &apos;t want to transmit any &amp; CD ; data to fre@@ ed@@ b Server . the first check box should be enough .
just take the settings of screen photo . ( make sure the folder / tmp is on your computer )
number of simultaneously equi@@ pping pieces : exc@@ use , there is why more than one at the same time when using existing drive ? parallel reading and en@@ code ? the author doesn &apos;t know , therefore try to try .
CD ; after reading the last piece : cross this to the &amp; CD ; take out at the end of the trial .
user @-@ defined file for temporary files : if you can cross this folder , then the path / folders can be specified . if the box is not enabled , the files will be created in the private folder . don &apos;t forget this folder when you want to make something with the WAV files .
all in such way as it is on the screen photo . the command is somewhat long , under circumstances must see anything according to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3s . as already mentioned before , it is sufficient for very good audio quality , even for very good stereo audio systems . the resulting rate is approximately 224 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the restriction of production of tags on version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1 &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can be used when needed . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of subsequent modification of the tags . % f and % o are internal variables available for the name of the input ( including the complete path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest like in screenshot . some comments for future use outside this sample :
number of simultaneously to codi@@ le WAV files : with a Du@@ al@@ core or Quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried to en@@ code more than a WAV file simultaneously .
that &apos;s it , we &apos;ve just finished the basic setup of &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; this configuration is used as standard for each read of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organis@@ ational structure of your music you never need to change it again .
in this section is described as the process of expression of the &amp; CD ; we will create MP3 files . first , the file structure is set up and set up . first , a connection to the internet is set up , since we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the fre@@ ed@@ b is described , must be repeated for any type &amp; CD ; repeated in this section .
since we are a &amp; CD , which is not yet contained in fre@@ ed@@ b , see the screen photos a bit differently than those for a &amp; CD ; so you will learn the &amp; CD ; you will learn the data manually , instead of them from the internet . comments are pointing to the differences .
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
if this has not yet come to happen , the &amp; CD is now , in the drive that has been defined in the main window .
after a short moment , the pieces and its length should be listed in the window , as in screen photo . this only if the &amp; CD ; as audio CD ; could be identified and by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia can be read .
if this is not done , then look for the questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section concerning the default settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD has been successfully picked away from the fre@@ ed@@ b , all title of the songs are already filled out , and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed .
in case there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; there will be a window embedded in , and you can select the database entry , which your opinion is best on your &amp; CD .
if you don &apos;t have the check box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the site &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for Settings ) you can also purchase this manually by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you have no local database , you will need the connection to the Internet .
E 1.2 Step 02 : the CD Editor - Input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
specify the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen photo one . title of the piece in the first line of the &apos; Update title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; album &apos; .
the artist must not be entered into the &apos; Re@@ eller Title &apos; , unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
the lower commentary box can be used for the individual comments ini@@ di@@ j@@ ell per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments which apply to all the pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful recall of the data from fre@@ ed@@ b , the CD editor is not empty . however , it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD @-@ editor ( e.g. if all words begin with grand@@ letters or not ... ) but also to check if there are any un@@ wanted notes .
note : in this example , we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags for the artist , album and title of a piece and at only 28 characters for the comment range . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have set unlimited field length , at least on the code card code settings ; take a look at option &apos; basic settings &apos; .
you can change the tag information of the created files later with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags will not be supported by all codes or file formats , and you can see in the help of a co@@ ater to obtain more information .
simply select an entry that is obvious to the style of the conc@@ ise CD ; this example is not important because we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; for more information on the website of fre@@ ed@@ .@@ org and read the information about the categories . pop or R@@ ap for example are available under Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . just click on line with the second piece .
the window of the CD @-@ Ed@@ itors will be back and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we have recorded for the first piece . just enter the entries for the fields of the actual product . the title of the piece is definitely and other information you wish .
click on the next line in the main window and process the same way until you have entered all the title data from the &amp; CD .
attention : this window appears not when you have downloaded the data from fre@@ ed@@ b . it is sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool bar . note that the artist and the album will be displayed on the piece list .
note that there is a check @-@ sign before each line of a piece . only the titles are selected . make sure that all the pieces are selected , or informed the button All pieces at the bottom edge of the screen to choose all the pieces at one time .
when clicking on the button select the outlet process , this window appears to be confirmation . click OK , and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track up what expi@@ res .
click on the riders tab for switching on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool bar .
this is the window to control the com@@ missions . the first piece is just read on the disk drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window .
this error message you see if you are trying to work with a body if you haven &apos;t installed . pieces that were not successfully encoded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the tmp file and the target file are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked the write access to the folder for temporary files and target folders ? ; - )
now it &apos;s clear why the error occurred right after the end of the first piece .
the task 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the coding of pieces 1 into the format MP3 . thus , read out and coding in parallel . note the status in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has found no configuration attitude to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only difference being configurable is the result of parallel processes to read and en@@ code . the use calcul@@ ator with a AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem when simultaneously read and coding ( from however two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read , while another piece is coded , and a third order is encoded in the qu@@ eu@@ e of the Ko@@ di@@ zer . after the last piece is coded , a small window will be built with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; , you will need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x. or 4.x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG , you will need the code of your choice .
&amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; if you &apos;re talking about CV@@ S , you can download an anonymous copy here . most distri@@ butions are already a pre @-@ compiled package , da &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ art ; package . install the package including media from your distribution . if you read it , you probably have already done it ...
this section is aimed at individuals , compiled by source files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for assistance to help your needs can be adjusted once it is running , then the following is true for you :
a program that calls many different programs on settings . best read the step by step example to learn the options and settings . it shows screen photos of the different card maps of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
hello , still alive ? even if only use the menu after the first start starting date , it should pass away from this somehow to empty screen ( especially when it is located at the time of program start no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ?
why is it ? who reads that , probably already started the program . it should look something like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author can &apos;t listen to this manual . it is thought as first version for a manual of &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; who also wants to add anything else or change anything else after contact with the author . and if you read it , he has to leave this section and therefore agree with this suggest@@ ion .
strange if it has managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N you do not need these information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and kar@@ a@@ oke player from &amp; k@@ de ; . besides other , he did not have some features with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ a@@ oke real @-@ emphasis on texts , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; k@@ mid ; also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ asound project driver , which is required for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; shows the lyrics in the screen with changing color , so it is easy to follow the piece .
graphic representation of the activity of each MIDI channel through high@@ lighting of the pressing buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can walk in &amp; k@@ de ; every MIDI file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window to go on K@@ Mid .
supports both existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( post @-@ set@@ ups or tex@@ tures ) . K@@ Mid automatically det@@ ects the procedures .
seat support . if you finish &amp; k@@ des ; during the playing of a song , K@@ Mid starts again with the same song again .
support external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first you can choose ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog with which you can select the desired song .
you can also let a file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window will drop . this also works with multiple songs simultaneously .
to play a piece of music , open it and read the button shut@@ down in the tool bar , select the entry of play from the menu , or informed the Le@@ ert@@ aste .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts once you go to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window . ( at several pieces they will be added to a collection and then play after each other . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece plays , you can jump to any position by using the middle mouse button and drive on the regulator .
if you find that a song can be played quickly or too slow , you can click on the arrows on the left and right of the template . to get the original pace , double click on Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the Le@@ ert@@ aste has two tasks : when one piece is played , a pressure on the empty string works as a pressure on the button pause , or selecting the menu entry in the menu , thus breaking down the reproduction . if you want to play the void button during no piece , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; the reproduction .
song lyrics can be stored on two types in a piece of music . some pieces use tex@@ tures , others use lyrics and again other both . some pieces have no text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can adjust what events are supposed to be displayed automatically and even better : the event type is automatically determined by selecting a song , so you will automatically adjust the Kara@@ oke text automatically . but you still have the opportunity to change this if you want the other way you want .
if you want to set a type of event , select from the menu settings the entries tex@@ tures / post @-@ set@@ ups . the same function also have the buttons 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files which you summar@@ ize . these will be played in the series . in this section it stands as you can efficiently ut@@ ili@@ ze collections .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager first . find out in the menu collection under the point of organizing .... Click on New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy a existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs like the original .
if you have more than one collection , you can set up the desired collection .
in the temporary collection all songs you want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application , this collection will not be stored . act if you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song by adding a song . it appears again the file dialog with which you can select the desired song .
a second method to add a song depends on the setup automation software .
when Automatic Adding to the collection is enabled , a piece when opening ( using file or drag &amp; drop ) will be added automatically to the active collection .
when Automatic window is not enabled , the collection will be activated and emp@@ tied . this collection will then be added to open pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click on removing .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the sequence from the sub @-@ menu sequence of the menu collections , the songs are played in the order , as they were added to the collection .
if you add songs or remove any random sequence in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager or use the selection list above the kar@@ a@@ oke text .
to navigate a song , select the Next song , next song from the pop @-@ up menu or press the arrow to the right .
to jump back a song to jump back the button , select the previous piece from the menu or press the arrow to the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection and click on the button .
the temporary collection can not be cleared . however , that doesn &apos;t matter , since it is not saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; not stored .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thes@@ izers , which are not general @-@ MIDI capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI events will be translated into events that under@@ stands syn@@ thesizer .
for example , you can create a MIDI map , which change all events of Change patch patch to B@@ right piano in events of Change Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et , thus making a trumpet sound when originally a piano should play .
if you have only one sound@@ card , you don &apos;t need MIDI @-@ Map because all sound cards are GM compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices , and so on ) .
unfortunately , there is no programs to create MIDI maps , so you have to edit the corresponding file by hand ( with your favorite folder ) .
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that all required requirements for playing a piece of play .
each section may appear only once , except for the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section , which may appear so often as desired . for this , however , that each appearance has different text ID ( see below ) .
define P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D define KE@@ Y@@ MAP &quot; Name of Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D define CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D options ... EN@@ D options ... EN@@ D
you see that it is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for options ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as email , so I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can offer devices that are not general @-@ MIDI compatible .
in this section it is specified as the patches from General MIDI to your specific keyboard . the general use looks as follows :
please note that the left side of the equality sign is igno@@ red . it is believed that the GM patches are in the right order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order , and no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional all@@ key@@ s@@ To M is used to put all sounds that this instrument does not need to put the sound with the number M . if your keyboard supports the sound ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can use a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which is similar to a def@@ en@@ dow@@ er . for this purpose , you can toler@@ ate the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section :
so if now a MIDI file should play a note with Patch 127 ( def@@ ective ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is located in the MIDI file .
please note that with the term Drum patch the patch is meant that each sound is another perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ary instrument ( drum , bas@@ ins , Mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and is not the one that means the sound height of the always same drum ( as some key@@ boards have the same drum ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section is used to specify how sounds are shown on a specific channel or instrument . the use is :
as in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as their presence . you must create 128 entries .
you can define several key@@ boards for each channel and each instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
key@@ boards are mainly used to form tones on the Persian channel . take a look at the key@@ word .
this section can be used to transfer some channels to others . if you want to replace the first and second channel , make it simply the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards which have the percussion on a certain channel ( General MIDI to Channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , according to the following pattern :
N is the channel that is depicted on the channel N . if you use the key@@ map option to use the name name for this channel . if you are using the For@@ ce@@ patch option , all events will ignore the patch on this channel . in this case there will always be patch x used .
the For@@ ce@@ patch option can be useful for example to always use the perc@@ us@@ sions patch on the per@@ kus@@ sions channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ ben@@ ch@@ ratio should be multiplied in which ratio of the pitch test events should be multiplied by the value n , this will be re@@ directed to the formula n * ( r / 4096 ) and then only re@@ directed . the value 4096 is used , so that in the Map file does not stand dec@@ imal number ) .
this setting is used because GM proposes that a keyboard , that should play a pitch test event with the value 4096 to play a sound higher . unfortunately , try some key@@ boards for two sounds up to a octave higher . in order to find the right value on your keyboard , you have to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; .
to use a MIDI map , simply open the dialog for MIDI Settings . this can be found in the menu under settings , point MIDI settings
the channel view is a window with a whole range of keyboard ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on this keyboard , you can only see which sounds are played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you have changed an instrument , the button doesn &apos;t turn green but red , to indicate that no more the original instrument is used .
the channel view ( until now ) has two different views to display the installed sounds . the view can be chosen in the menu settings under the point se@@ wer view : settings
the pace @-@ LCD displays the speed when the song is played . the higher the number , the bigger the speed .
you can change the pace of a song . for example , if you find a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the pace , use the arrows left and right from the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece must be played . it contains the notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; . thus , the same MIDI file can lead to two different devices with very different results , just as two different musicians can play the same banknotes in very different ways .
good , I can do not use , &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while a mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc ; you have control over all .
that can happen if you have a bin@@ ds ( rpm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support compiled . to eliminate the problem , you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example of k@@ mid ; &apos;s homepage )
I want to add a whole file to a collection , but I have no desire to add all files individually .
agree , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; D@@ rag &amp; Drop . open the folder you want to add in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window .
before necessarily , enable Automatic Adding to the collection . otherwise , the files are added to a temporary collection .
you can select the arrow move to the left from Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . in order to restore the standard temp@@ o you can click on the LCD .
I have on a &amp; k@@ art ; -@@ Desktop with my MIDI files and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I want to play a kar@@ a@@ oke file ) or attached ( if I want to play a kar@@ a@@ oke file or I want to play a file , only in the &amp; @-@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window to change and drag the file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ; .
if you want to listen to a file quickly , without having to add them directly to a collection , turn the setup Autom@@ atically adding to the collection , and the new ; file is added to a temporary collection .
let &apos;s suppose you have MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ d. if you want to play the first file . so , set Automatic Adding to Collection and Open A.@@ mi@@ des your temporary collection then contains a MIDI file .
and then , join the B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid play and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! if I see these songs or see postcard , animated me , next to &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Anton@@ i@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez , from Ma@@ ths ; Lag@@ a . at the moment I am in the third year , so I &apos;m trying to take a lot of time for my ho@@ b@@ bies , but I try to collect some time . as Hob@@ bies I have programming , MIDI files , music make and phr@@ ases prove .
if you want to know where they want to download MIDI / kar@@ a@@ oke files , if you want a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you simply want to make me happy , write an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es
you really make a huge joy@@ ful thinking , if you send me a postcard from your residence or a MID@@ I@@ - / kar@@ a@@ oke file from a local group . if you want to send a postcard from &amp; k@@ mid ; if you want to receive a MIDI file , you should contact me when I &apos;ve got the file .

a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , because the sound quality is considerably influenced by your sound card . it is not the same if you use a FM device or a AW@@ E card .
if you have no sound card , you have to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DEM@@ O _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL , it will run as if you could have a sound card , except that you cannot hear any music .
if problems occur , please contact a &amp; k@@ de ; mail boxes , or send an error messages directly to me .
&amp; k@@ m@@ Player ; is a simple interface for M@@ player , Phon@@ o and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is used to play video files that supported by M@@ Player or phon@@ on supported formats , as well as to play DVD &apos;s , VCD or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet completed as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
for additional help , check the page The K@@ DE website to new releases , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; user ma@@ iling list .
the application window is formed from so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the top view . alternatively , there is a window with the playlist . and finally there is a information window that will only appear when you are subject to it .
it is possible to choose the preferred connections under the menu book@@ marks , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries , you should use the category Permanent playlist .
of course you can add groups to groups to get an additional hier@@ arch@@ est@@ u@@ fe . if you copy a record , his group and all its sub @-@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback begins with the associated entry .
the categories &apos; current pieces &apos; , television and thum@@ b playlist can also be changed via an editor , but also through the application itself . in addition , the various files can choose from the menu list , but also through the application itself . in addition , the XML content will select only the XML content of this partition .
after changing XML files , the menu must be selected with playlist , or select either the edit mode , or select another category .
all changes are lost when working mode leave or select another group without the playlist .
due to the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ Player ; some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files ..
the animation at starting and finish can be de@@ activated through the editing of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and change by &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be inserted simply .
it is also possible to activate any other animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ Player / share / k@@ m@@ player / € .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / k@@ m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation at start does not need to be short , it will automatically termin@@ ate through the opening of another source . this would be anno@@ ying with the end @-@ animation , the user may termin@@ ate the application an second time .
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be up to a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; body@@ work ; &amp; lt ; IM@@ G = &quot; Me@@ et &quot; / / / home / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; Me@@ et ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ ooth@@ ills ; In list tests tests / some examples of S@@ MIL the von &amp; k@@ m@@ Player ; are supported .
there is a rider to configure M@@ player in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ Player ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the Inter@@ est memory of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for trou@@ bl@@ esho@@ oting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool bar of k@@ m@@ player . here is the issue of m@@ player clearly .
there is no rider for this playback device in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ Player ; . everything must be configured by manual processing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c , such as the setting of the back@@ end by m@@ im@@ et@@ ype . here is an example of a &apos; flash &apos; with the sw@@ add@@ it@@ ant Mozilla module :
&apos; Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; m@@ player ; it can even be inserted the special box em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
so that the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; can play in HTML pages , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module as a service provider for the M@@ ime type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the setup dialog for orders of K@@ DE .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or &amp; k@@ m@@ Player ; is used in any consoles application to browse the library &apos;s library . if there is no error occur , the backup issue is within &amp; k@@ m@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
in order to use a pre@@ defined back@@ end for a certain M@@ ime type ( of course only if this was also determined ) , it must be done by manual changing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example phon@@ on all og@@ g files are used :
&amp; k@@ m@@ Player ; can play by TV tickets , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs c@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be seen , the scanner will be used on the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually .
for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( Video data Records ) settings in the c@@ player , the dialog can be detected in the settings - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there should ports be detected , which is intended to be found . the encoding must be found ( e.g. , it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably included a DVB .
since the V@@ DR can only use X@@ Video to work only X@@ Video ( probably this kind of play@@ site does not work on Linux ) . this is why the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux expansion must also be used for the X server . for the XFree86 server , this is therefore not included in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .
internally they are used by KM@@ Player for sources of different names . at the time of creating this documentation , this d@@ v@@ d@@ n@@ av@@ source , d@@ v@@ d@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ r@@ source . if they are activated , they start playing the playlist .
are there indications like I can do my CD@@ ROM drive , if I play from him ( not from the VCD : / / ) ?
yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ e 8 / dev / c@@ drom game can be run as user root after adjusting the device . it is absolutely safe to adjust / dev / c@@ drom on the CD@@ ROM drive .
X@@ ine starts only slowly , why do I have to test my CPU on their performance every time ?
note : the answer is over@@ taking . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player needs automatically the last stored value , only the first time will check x@@ ine the CPU .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + to create graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ ile ; needed .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional character set application . under Unix and such systems it is probably used on the package &amp; tex@@ as ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be used in the used &amp; Linux ; Distribution Distribution included . for installation the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD will be used .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; project includes some compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for various distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the c@@ ile ; web site included .
this manual is for everyone - independently of the experiences with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ J ; , &amp; c@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users must hardly read these manual . however , all proposals for the documentation is taken into account . if the support is required for this project or its documentation , the contact information should be created via the k@@ ile ; website .
any questions on or to comp@@ ile of &amp; c@@ ile ; on or are extensions , this should be addressed to the ma@@ iling list k@@ ile @-@ dev@@ el @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; k@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ environment for &amp; de ; - Desktop . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; functions in an graphic surface and within this simple , direct and customized access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; otherwise , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; lat@@ ex , reference and powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and its possibilities to experience the manual should be attracted to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can take place directly by reading the chapter by the Editor &amp; Kate .
for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the right exit : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . it is difficult to use , can also use a La@@ ie ( English L@@ ay ) &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ Mak@@ ros . a less challenging but more realistic replacement is that it is derived from the post name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
to be here only a good view to &amp; lat@@ ex ; it is not the ultimate book to have it . by &amp; lat@@ ex ; properly @-@ rule , for example H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. Dal@@ y , A Guide to &amp; Lat@@ ex ; : Document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 d@@ af@@ Ã ¼ r .
just like other identification languages , &amp; lat@@ ex ; a introduction , with which the gener@@ alized properties like paper format , side number@@ ing and text file will be defined as well as a body with the command \ \ master class , and must be closed with the command \ \ Beg@@ in { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ master { document } .
the fast @-@ level assistant of &amp; k@@ ile ; is an excellent function for the rapid creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; . the selection of the assistant ( Men@@ Ã ¼ ) offers some options for creating the document . it can also be made to document the document @-@ related settings .
docum@@ ent@@ aries : this will be the type of creating a document : article &#91; article &#93; , letter &#91; PDF &#93; , report &#91; ... &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ ut@@ pr@@ t &#93; , Code ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ ut@@ pr@@ t &#93; , Code ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ ut@@ pr@@ t &#93; , fo@@ ils &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or Custom &#93; .
coding : this is set to be used for encoding the system . modern systems should use the UTF @-@ 8 encoding than standard . if necessary , UTF @-@ 8x should be used as default . if necessary , UTF @-@ 8x should be used ( correct processing the &amp; lat@@ ex processing ) .
this list contains the most common add @-@ packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the integration they are only covered in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . you should always find use in creating German texts .
new users don &apos;t worry , there is only a brief description of functions and more information about this will be presented in the section .
&amp; c@@ ile ; offers - just like other sources of source editors - the high@@ lighting of the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . by &amp; k@@ ile ; it is still noticed by a modest appearance of output file . however , it will still be replaced by the modest appearance of output file . however , you will save you through the high@@ lighting time and follow @-@ up .
with automatic adjustment of the environments is generated by entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ Beg@@ in { command } ) of &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically creates a space line ( for input of the text ) and the next line is activated ( e.g. \ \ \ { command } ) . this function can be de@@ activated in the menu settings ... La@@ Te@@ X orders disabled .
all documents are normally divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; the document &apos;s sub@@ division into the following elements ( part is the most common and sub@@ ordin@@ ated element ) :
in view of the document in the structural view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a single click on the respective screen .
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful when a DVI , jumps &amp; k@@ ile ; due to a click with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; viewer on the corresponding line in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information about the font collection of &amp; tex ; or &amp; Lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools for view , converting and to print DVI ; -@@ files for different systems and quality .
when using the follow @-@ up search , the elements of the DVI ; file with the editor are cli@@ cked and once upon a element in the DVI ; file is cli@@ cked , the exact opposite is the exact opposite . once on a section in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text is cli@@ cked on the corresponding site in the DVI ; viewer indication .
Master @-@ document : this function is used in working with multiple files . using a master document the work is simplified using other embedded .@@ tex files . using a project a project document can be set out over project project settings .
quick construction : the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if no error occurred in the source code ) .
file attach@@ ments : in this mode , the DVI , file is displayed on the opposite reference â -@@ file it is no call by &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after quick construction .
for viewing the processing tool bar , the three large selection box should be found out . the first selection box is designed for quick connection to the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The ver@@ able &amp; Lat@@ ex document ; commands for the sub@@ division are :
the selection box Further is to be used in articles such as tags , Fu@@ Ã ¼ notes , or references . those are available :
name : using this command , a name is designed for a section , a picture or different element .
reference : is used for reference to a fixed designation ( choose a selection box ) .
when using quot@@ ation , a selection list with literary entries is shown . for &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are appropriate editors . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; - files can also be written in &amp; k@@ ile ; by hand it will be written .
the last selection box with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ . e is used for defin@@ ing the fonts for the main text , the fox notes etc. set . it is available for the following fonts :
when the call of &amp; k@@ ile ; two selection criteria are available : 1 . the assistant for creating a new document by selecting the document type and fixed legend . 2 . document can be written by reason with hand .
brackets for the command \ \ cycle class contain the settings for the command . the font set &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; specifies the fonts . the font is not fixed at the beginning , this can also be done in the text .
once the above source code was entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex code must be compiled . the sim@@ pl@@ est way for this is the use of the menu of building or the button quick construction .
the source code must be stored in front of the comp@@ iling . &amp; c@@ ile ; for storing the storage automatically .
the comp@@ iling of the document should be searched for errors according to errors , should be started automatically when using quick construction &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; this is not the case , also the protocol changes should also be considered .
a environment ( English environment ) is a text that is described differently than the remaining document . for example , a report with the font is created . for example , the svn \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ Documents ( English ) is to be seen .
the changes are only covered within the environment ( from \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ ) .
there are many mut@@ ations for the threat of read@@ ability and us@@ ability of the document . for example , certain fonts , grease printing , cran@@ ial pressure , sub@@ sub@@ missions , etc. added to the end of the environment . these commands are either complete with the command \ \ or automatically at the end of its surroundings .
\ \ Beg@@ in { em@@ ph } : this command is for the cran@@ ial pressure and is as long as long as long as it is closed until it is closed with a \ \ by { em@@ ph } or another environment . a single word in a set can be displayed with \ \ em@@ ph { word } curve .
\ \ Qu@@ ote : created a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ Beg@@ in { Qu@@ ote } and ends with \ \ as { Qu@@ ote } .
after the background to write the source text by &amp; lat@@ ex , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; k@@ ile is followed by step @-@ by @-@ step guide .
as soon as soon as an assistant was entered into a bit text , a few adjustments for the better reading of the document should be completed . this should be min@@ ated , a few places in the fat and cur@@ sive impression and a po@@ em to application to see the differences of these commands .
as soon as the document has been viewed , can be returned to the editor by Editor @-@ View or C@@ tr@@ l E ( on the internal panel ) . at an external viewer , the window must be closed .
once the DVI ; file has been created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; PDF file . simply try and fun .
DVI ; is a high @-@ quality file format ( English . D V V ice I n@@ d. ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; Lat@@ ex ; for the reading of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output like printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file converter or computer screens .
for printing a &amp; DVI ; file are the same steps as for creating the document ( see ) . after clicking on DVI , you can print the document using file print ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool bar enables the conversion of DVI ; file in other formats . once the DVI ; file created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code was created , the conversion in some other formats can begin with buttons in the tool@@ bar .
the occurr@@ ence seek direct jump from the editor to the inside common position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; c@@ ile ; provides an appropriate setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Bin@@ ding files . only Modern under Settings ... Tools must be included ...
to search for the occurr@@ ences , the mouse indicator has to be positioned in a line of the source text and close to pre@@ conditions . the jump to the corresponding site in the DVI ; panel viewer will then be stored .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with one click of the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ document by &amp; k@@ ile ; ge@@ ared and to the appropriate line . for this purpose &amp; k@@ ile ; as text editor will be defined as text editor ... Editor )
if using quick construction of the &amp; DVI ; viewer will not be possible , an error can be found in the protocol file or in the message window .
the log file converted the error source in source code . in the Editor then the buttons can always be used between errors . the log file is always displayed on the error in the error . to view the faul@@ ty line , the error code must be cli@@ cked on the error in the log file and / c@@ ile ; jumps to the incorrect line .
once the button in the tool bar will be cli@@ cked , a window will appear on the selection of the displayed template for the document . the default shows are :
with a selection of empty document , a document may be written either by the reason or the assistant to the rapid creation of a new document . further information is included in the section .
H@@ Ã ¤ rated users by &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates for virtually all documents . templates created , stored and up@@ loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , it must be created either a current &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file the file can be created or create a new file . &amp; k@@ ile ; can create a new template using document document and choose from file template ... create .
when creating a new document , a document of a new document will be replaced by some character strings due to other data ( e.g. name or string coding ) . these variables can be set up in settings ... settings can be set .
when creating the own template , it is therefore necessary to know what variables are replaced by the variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ M@@ ENT@@ CLASS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ : this string will be replaced by the input in documentation class . typically , they will be used as follows : \ \ standard class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ M@@ ENT@@ CLASS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { article } .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to create a template is the use of the assistant and the result of the prec@@ epts in the editor . once the document was created in this way , the following steps will be completed :
when creating a new document , the own template can be selected rather than the standard .
a template may be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; a simple way to create a template should be sought after one on the Internet and through the steps below .
&amp; Kate ; used &amp; Kate ; used as an internal editor . &amp; Kate . is a text editor for program@@ mers with the possibility of reading and high@@ lighting of many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . lots of settings for &amp; Kate . can be made directly from &amp; k@@ ile ; they can be made out .
to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and you will learn to discover the manual of Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; users can also start with reading the chapter by &amp; Kate .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command line , which can be called for the menu La@@ Te@@ X Reference . it contains nearly all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use and their syntax .
a double @-@ click with inver@@ ted string button to increase the &amp; tex ; meaning that in this way , when clicking on \ \ par of \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p is only \ \ par .
when shooting the text with ad@@ joining left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to clip@@ board .
when using the arrow keys , you can be fully covered in the source text of the source text in the editorial window .
&amp; c@@ ile ; has the ability to browse the most diverse types of source texts to browse these elements . for example , the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; commands from normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ulas can be distinguished by another colour .
many assist@@ ants will be able to sign a special type of book@@ marks inside the text . the menu entry jumps , or the corresponding key ¼ r@@ zel , this jumps is highlighted , so that it will automatically be taken during the first input of a drawing .
the editing is probably one of the main aspect of using a program such as &amp; k@@ ile ; . although &amp; Kate . already excellent features for the writing of a &amp; lat@@ ex ; special features for their selection . under editing options , the following commands are included in the text selection :
if there is a complete he@@ x ( group of lines that contain on both sides a blank line ) . this expanded importance as@@ cri@@ es to tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands and all other lines of the source code . the only be@@ ating thing in &amp; k@@ ile ; is that the actual thing is separated by two blank lines .
if the word is from the current cur@@ sor position . this selection also has an extended meaning as this command is also &amp; lat@@ ex ; command commands with a covered star ( \ \ ) and a wide star ( * ) at the end .
to become a document of the document , you may be removed this first . &amp; Kate . offers the key ¼ r@@ zel C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the entire line will be removed . &amp; c@@ ile ; offers its own commands this for a faster result . under editing , the following commands are included in the text of the text :
remov@@ es a complete paragraph . the definition for a sub@@ section in &amp; k@@ ile ; is contained in the description to do pane sheet .
it has been clear that environments offers a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore it offers &amp; k@@ ile ; for more commands under editing environment for a fully functional easy work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
with this command , at the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to open the surrounding area .
with this command , at the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to close the neighbourhood .
if the cur@@ sor is before or within the command \ \ Beg@@ in { Environment } is located at the end of the surrounding area ( or vice versa ) .
in the input of many tigh@@ ten ambient commands can be lost quickly . this command as@@ cri@@ es the last sum@@ mon@@ ed surrounding area , so that the shifted ambient structure cannot be over@@ thrown .
&amp; k@@ ile ; also special commands for the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ groups that are determined by brackets { ... } . under editing Te@@ X Group are a few important commands to which are used in editing environment .
with this command , at the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the welded cl@@ amps .
with this command , at the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the welded cl@@ amps .
when the cur@@ sor is before or behind the welded cl@@ amps of a &amp; tex ; Group # is located to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
during the input of many f@@ ooth@@ ed groups @-@ cl@@ amps can be lost fast the possibility . this command as@@ cri@@ es the most recently ordered group , so that the station@@ ed structure of the &amp; tex won &apos;t match the groups .
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; we are used to use two simple beginner signs . for this purpose , the character is used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the sign &quot; will be used for two easy replacement . &amp; k@@ ile ; knows this case and for two closing stages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one .
this automatic insertion of the double course number can be setup and switched on settings ... La@@ Te@@ X .
it can also be used to process specific settings ( e.g. n@@ bs or French ) and therefore German or French beginner course . there are also many other languages available .
in the Dr@@ illing of Shift ; Inclu@@ ding &amp; k@@ ile ; an intelligent line breaks . if the current position is located within a list -@@ environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , do not only take a line breaks , but also the command \ \ item .
inside a tables -@@ environment close -@@ t &amp; k@@ ile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with an an@@ ked line breaks off .
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ installed &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom environments . you can add to the settings ... La@@ Te@@ X .
some users have to arrange the columns in tables -@@ environments and all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) among themselves . &amp; k@@ ile ; tries to ex@@ propri@@ ate this line . although this tab@@ ulator does not be the da@@ zz@@ led table ; although this tab@@ ulator does not be the da@@ zz@@ led . although this tab@@ ulator does not be the da@@ zz@@ led , does &amp; k@@ ile ; a few spaces for the columns is added to the current table .
although &amp; Kate ; already has a good source code , it has been expanded into &amp; k@@ ile ; for special commands ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) . there are three different modes installed . these are three according to your requirements and the other two are available for automatic transmission . all these modes can be set with settings ...
in the beginning a new environment using the command \ \ Beg@@ in { Environment } is &amp; c@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ &apos; to an empty line ( for the text ) after an empty row ( for the text ) .
when pressing the R@@ Ã ¼ ck@@ button , the last character of the input is removed , and it is possible to disc@@ ern the compreh@@ en@@ ary list . on the other hand , the list can also be sc@@ aled by entering a further letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions are removed with selection of a command . alternatively , jumps to these positions will be possible , so that a simple jump to these positions by editing the ski jumps is possible and the only parameters will be spot@@ ted then .
under settings c@@ ile ; setting ... c@@ ile ; compreh@@ en@@ sively settings are made to these lists . it can be used for different colors for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; orders as well as honey@@ s of general language used .
the command mode is not suitable for the integration of environments . there are always a few letters with \ \ Beg@@ in , and the call of the fully operational mode will be a rough list with ambient conditions . on the other hand , the environments are so often used , that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for the realisation of environments is needed .
when selecting the fully @-@ to @-@ talk mode of the menu Alt + Shift to press , the order will automatically be moved automatically and it appears to \ \ Beg@@ in . after that , the ambient temperature can be continued in a simple way and can be un@@ finished by pressing the input .
after this is accomplished the environment will automatically be closed automatically . once &amp; k@@ ile ; recognis@@ ing that there is a lists of environment , it is even a first \ \ item command .
under settings c@@ ile ; setting ... c@@ ile ; compreh@@ en@@ sively settings are made to these lists . this mode uses the possibility of reference mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands .
&amp; c@@ ile ; customized lists of ab@@ out@@ ings that will be replaced immediately through l@@ ump strings . the lists can be fully furnished with settings ... as an example of a selection list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , the letter L is entered and the word @-@ term mode of the menu can be replaced , the letter L is replaced by the character L \ La@@ Te@@ X by the character string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
great experience are not helpful . however , it was found that many whales are written in a document more than once . it offers &amp; k@@ ile ; all rights are written .
this mode can be set up in the settings of K@@ ile ... K@@ ile Ver@@ don &apos;t be completed . here , the threshold value for the ad placement can be specified .
the fully @-@ quality files can be installed in the sub @-@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / mode / k@@ ile / Complete / mode / from the Persian home @-@ folder . mode is available for down@@ time ( decre@@ asing ) , Dictionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ nal ) or tex .
the dialog Prin@@ ts presents the entry of graphics as easy as possible . to view the fundam@@ entals of the graphics formats , sections and sections should be considered .
PS files are not so known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for changes and new orders of pages . will be re@@ arranged to the pages with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools new and then converted with p@@ s@@ 2@@ pdf to a PDF file .
in order to make the result of the work has to be compiled . all the construction tools are group@@ ed into the menu &apos;s creation , creating converting and creating views .

the version 3.2 of &amp; quantitative inform@@ us ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; quantitative ; . all these tools are unique in their integration as a surface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt . the combination yields quick , efficient , complete and productive tools .
everyone who worked with &amp; k@@ de ; this documentation has been realized , think it &apos;s still a piece , we give it a graphic surface ! not more on a terminal block , simply click the icon for the XML processor and ready !
this application is expected to be inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is located in a non@@ violent working folder , then you can remove the current working folder . if not , then remove it the selection of current working folder and enter the desired folder in the field of other folders .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files will be deleted once every time .
as already said that every one on the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation already worked , knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; quantitative Analytics ; there is now a great graphic surface .
if the straight opened file inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is , then they simply let the current working folder . if not , then choose the current working folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is to be found .
if it comes to an issue on screen , its file is incorrect . please check the reported errors and try it again .
if the file is already marked in &amp; quantitative file it is already marked in &amp; quantitative file ; then you can simply delete the current file simply . if not , delete them at current file the tick and select the file that can select file by other file - file selection .
if you only want to know if the well @-@ established file is well @-@ formed , you will find the well @-@ established viewing selection .

specify the name of the file as the result should have . the file is normally stored in its home folder .
the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; quantitative form , have you to do with &amp; quantitative inform@@ us ; even you may benefit from the additional functionality immediately . you can &apos;t wait until som@@ eb@@ ody is able to get the desired in &amp; quantitative ; the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; they can find out more below .
to install a plug@@ in or a K@@ part , we begin the menu @-@ ins menu . this will open the following dialog :
this dialog allows to manage all plug@@ ins and add new plug@@ ins . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ element to :
here you can type the search engine . when adding plug @-@ ins without a storage location &amp; quantitative information ; this path leads to the search of plug@@ ins .
often working on a project several people work in a kind of hier@@ arch@@ ical relationship . &amp; quantitative information ; supports team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties Project Properties dialog .
the name and email records are self explan@@ atory . N@@ ick@@ name is the nick@@ name of user and serves for unique identification .
one member can have several roles in the project , such as team leader as well as Sub@@ project leader .
the user can choose from the list of te@@ amm@@ ates , who is it . this happens when he is ex@@ presses the team member from the list and press the button . the current member ( its identification ) appears to be fat after you are : text .
top names and setting of its own identity are important for messages and notes . see for further information about remarks .
in addition to an overview of your team there is another advantage through the number of members of the team : it can be an event going to the team manager if something is done . see for further information .
event actions are actions that are executed if a certain specific project is happening . one example would be the record of opening and closing of the project , so that later , if a file is secured , or a script that plays a file in CV@@ S , once they will be added to the project , etc ;
at the side event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Settings dial@@ og@@ es can be created , edited and deleted .
an e @-@ mail is sent to the address selected in the recipi@@ ent list . the address can be a team or sub @-@ project leader . see , we@@ i such ladder can be set up .
notes are special comments in documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
note remarks is simple . it may either be selected using the editor @-@ context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key@@ word in a commentary area followed by an@@ gu@@ ext text .
ann@@ ot@@ ations can be sent to a particular member of the team . in this case , the syntax called @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( top name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , whereby the nick@@ name of the project leader Sub@@ project leader In addition to the range and sub@@ project leaders should be given the appropriate range or sub@@ project names , as in the examples below .
top names and rolls @-@ names are independent of large or small in@@ scriptions , but space characters for the cl@@ amps and the : make the note inv@@ alid .
&amp; Pro@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for script and form@@ att@@ ing languages , the DT@@ D @-@ ag@@ nost@@ ic is supported and web @-@ based form@@ att@@ ing and scripts .
the settings are reachable via the Settings menu . here only about &amp; quantitative address ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in .
the settings can be called Qu@@ anta ... the settings can be called . this dialogue extends over a few pages that will be treated with one another .
the behavior of &amp; quantitative information ; regarding tags , vehicle completion can thus be changed . the entries are :
large / Classi@@ fication of tags : large / Classi@@ fied Tags : size / Classi@@ fication means of automatically added tags : tags will be inserted so as they are described in tag@@ .@@ XML files .
large / Classi@@ fication of At@@ tri@@ bu@@ cks : large / Classi@@ fication of Autom@@ ated At@@ tri@@ bu@@ cks . regular Groß / Classi@@ fication means , the attributes are added so as they are described in tag@@ .@@ XML files .
optional tags automatically shut : if any act will be charged for tags , for which the closing day is optional , this immediately after getting &amp; gt ; inserted .
not optional tags : like above for all other tags with the exception of simple tags .
start and finish day automatically update : if enabled , the corresponding day will be carried away and vice versa .
automatic replacement of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acute characters in corresponding coding during use .
M@@ ime types : m@@ im@@ et@@ yp@@ es for detection of different types of files . by using the standard , standard pre @-@ set can be recovered .
standard string coding : the coding of newly created or in other way to open files ( where the encoding of the file can be addressed ) . however , this setting is out@@ sour@@ ced from the same in the project features , if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not recognized . this setting can be read from the same in the repository if a project is loaded .
create a backup copy : &amp; quantitative method : created on a regular backup of a power failure or crash when the next start of the program can be recovered from this backup . it is not the same as the saving of the file . even for the stored documents , a backup file is created , according to the set time , created .
the preview and documentation can either be displayed in the editorial area or a private view ( or documentation in a cart@@ il@@ it@@ iter ) , which makes it possible to view the documentation , preview and source text at the same time .
set the default settings to the standard back at the next start is useful if the user interface has come through the MDI modes and and@@ o@@ cken / depending on sight . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters .
the warning messages area serves to the tax of the possibility to dis@@ able the display of war@@ nings by no more questions .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can be changed instead of scripts , as well as the synchron@@ ization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and source text box can be specified in divided mode . as regards different modes see .
here , the par@@ ser and the structural tree , representing the diagram of the Par@@ ser no@@ des in the document , is set to details .
in the context of mouse click on the structural tree , the following action is possible to am@@ end the action by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse button .
in the area of structural tree settings , the Vis@@ ibility of the tree can be opened automatically when changing the tree tree into the editing and how deep when changing the structure tree will be adjusted automatically . empty no@@ des are the empty areas in the text , whereas empty groups are such that no element has been found in the current document .
the range for fixed ab@@ brevi@@ ation of ab@@ brevi@@ ations ( a type of templates ) can be un@@ folded in groups , each can be applied to multiple &amp; DT@@ EP ; s valid , it may be a valid group for PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ c ab@@ brevi@@ ation is valid as in a group valid for Javascript .
here the plug @-@ ins are managed . plug@@ ins are of the third page that can be used by each K@@ part @-@ enabled application , most well @-@ known &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug must be indicated :
address : the path to plug @-@ in if there is not in a standard place such as $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / lib .
input : this information is handed to the plug@@ in at the Start , so it can open the current file , the associated folders ( path of current file ) or the repository folder .
specify the component in &quot; Only @-@ read &quot; mode : check if the plug@@ in may refuse to store . only L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts refuse to load the load when this option is not chosen .
check the plug @-@ in : is this enabled , then test@@ et &amp; quantitative information ; if the entered information is right . please select the saving of the entry even if the plug@@ in at the moment is not available , but it will be installed later .
for Pro@@ c@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from version 3.3 , the trou@@ bl@@ esho@@ oting has been completely redesigned . the support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead , the support for the D@@ BG deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead , a deb@@ ug@@ ger plug @-@ in concept has been implemented that allows different implem@@ ent@@ ations over plug@@ ins .
currently only a plug @-@ in is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; in@@ quantitative address .
use of the deb@@ ug@@ ger for a project starts with the selection of a matching Deb@@ ug@@ ger plug@@ ins in the repository settings . using the button options , next to the deb@@ ug@@ ger plug @-@ in selection box , specific settings can be changed .
if a deb@@ ug@@ ger is activated , some additional elements appear in the &amp; quantitative method ; user interface :
a view that is displayed in the content of monitored variables is usually displayed in the left dock .
a view , where all the holding points , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower dock .
a view that is shown in the issue ( as in HTML ) of the deb@@ ug@@ ger . usually appears in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the deb@@ ug@@ gers , everything is available or part of the following functionality .
with this promotion , the connection to the deb@@ ug@@ ger , if necessary , or it divi@@ des the plug@@ in with , on de@@ bug requirements . this promotion will be called by default , which must be a deb@@ ug@@ ger that will not be kept in normal case .
the opposite to deb@@ ug@@ ging session starts the session . closes the connection to deb@@ ug@@ ger or end the l@@ ute to meet requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to initi@@ ate a deb@@ ug request . this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document . the issue of this requirement is shown in the view of the Deb@@ ug@@ ger issue .
refers to the deb@@ ug@@ ger , to begin the execution of the script and to send the line through the out@@ going variables as well as the currently completed line . if this happens , the version is continued , before a deb@@ ug@@ ging request starts , the script will start with the request .
refers to the deb@@ ug@@ ger to begin with the execution of the script without inform@@ ing information and the current line number . if this happens if a script was done , the version runs after a deb@@ ug@@ ging request starts , when a request is made .
the deb@@ ug@@ ger leads the next statement in the script without entering the functions or include .
the deb@@ ug@@ ger leads the next statement in the script , whereby if possible in functions and include settings .

this chapter describes how to custom@@ ize &amp; quantitative information ; to adapt to your needs and how to help you &amp; quantitative information ; help to be better .
document type E@@ ditions packages ( DT@@ EP ; s ) are used in &amp; quantitative languages ; used to give support for mark@@ up@@ - and scripts . their simp@@ licity and flexibility makes use of &amp; quantitative spaces ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web@@ developer , easy to use and productive .
&amp; DT@@ EP ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and / or CSS ; . &amp; DT@@ EP ; s are made of two parts , the tag file and the tool@@ bars . tag file are handy , symbol@@ ism dead@@ lines of picture buttons ( above the editing window ) , the text and instructions qu@@ icker into a document when a user may each .
&amp; DT@@ EP ; s can be established manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see for details about converting .
this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . shortly , an &amp; DT@@ EP ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ day ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the Fe@@ at@@ u@@ res@@ dial@@ og@@ es , the &amp; quantitative information ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; DT@@ EP ; even . tool aff@@ ord provide a fast insertion of tags in a document without a risk of writing .
tag folder are nothing as a folder . they contain only the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder bear the name of the writing language and version , so there . ( for example , html @-@ 4.0@@ 1 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML on and clear whether they are necessary , or not . although not all are necessary , it is advis@@ able to use as many as possible to allow other users a better viewing and more information on working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and bound@@ aries will be explained in simple way .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can contain only once in a document . it may contain the definition of many tags , but it can only contain anything about itself .
the Tags of the tags is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of function . ( only family 2 )
valid for the class type class . the name of the basic class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the Type Method . returns the name of the class to where this method is heard . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has a common attri@@ bute group and the attributes inside this tags can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 )
requires a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; -@@ day . that &apos;s a single @-@ element type element .
describes a attri@@ bute of a tags . this element can only occur once for each attri@@ bute . it sets the name and type of the attri@@ bute . additionally , it contains further tags that will describe how this attri@@ bute is supposed to be displayed , etc . this is an only element type element .
gives the source texts used for the attributes in the day of editorial dialog and attri@@ bute tree to the attributes .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; quantitative information ; is used to reach the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the names of an interface . d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; quantitative method is used to achieve the source of data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an interface and method name . the arguments that are handed to the method . can be empty , or % day name , which means the name of the current tags .
a tank @-@ tag that group@@ ed together the elements of a list . it can only occur for an attri@@ bute description only once . it is an element type element .
specifies the position of the attri@@ bute a tags within a dialog box . this day can only occur for each attri@@ bute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the element is empty .
returns the position and size of a field in the dialog . this day should be present for every field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this element is empty .
specifies a list of elements that may occur within the defined tags . this element is only an element type .
there is a list of elements that end a day . this element is a single @-@ element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; -@@ De@@ ad@@ ation start : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be ne@@ qu@@ ered and closed .
spaces may affect nothing but do not affect &amp; b &amp; lt ; characters . these should be by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will be replaced , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the tools dialog is to start at the top &amp; quantitative and check the Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . to choose . another dialog will appear to follow its simple follow @-@ up .
this function is currently not available . currently , check only when charging the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; quantitative information .
in the following an example of a family 1 @-@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; Element from the &amp; W@@ 3C ; &amp; XML ; sch@@ ema . the file name for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following an example of a working family 2 @-@ XML file . this file is described by a &amp; PHP ; Trans@@ charge function is described . the file name of this Tag@@ XML file is intended to be over@@ loaded .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &apos; over@@ load type = &apos; class &quot; &gt; &amp; lt ; att@@ r name = &apos; class &quot; status = &apos; string &apos; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt;
the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just quite simple and there is an editor that can be achieved via DT@@ D edit DT@@ D settings . it can be processed by a list of selectable &amp; DT@@ EP ; for a newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; a simple &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c should be created with the following entries :
&#91; General &#93; version = used de 1 for &amp; quantitative inform@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = DT@@ D indication . ( / / DT@@ D HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional ) . if not stated , the name is used as n@@ ick name .
a action can set up action with Settings ... . click on new action to the same dialog :
this action is assigned to a button . with clicking the button , button 1 can be assigned to the button . the current keyboard cut is aw@@ less .
the easiest actions . it can be entered into the detail settings and in version of the action , this text can be inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this promotion , you can change external applications ( or parts of the document ) , but it is not limited to the document ( or parts of the document ) , the quick@@ set up dialog or the different see in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ EPs .
first , the name of the script and interpre@@ ter must be given . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scri@@ pt@@ .@@ sh .
though qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scri@@ pt@@ you variable in the command line such as sh % scri@@ pt@@ dir . by the script file : $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / quantitative / Notes / quantitative / Notes / quantitative / Notes / quantitative file : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we replaced with the URL of the current documentation . in case of a local document file , file : / from the document name .
% pi@@ d : is replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; quantitative method ; when the text is running , the text can be changed to the P@@ ID number . this is useful if D@@ COP is used to control &amp; quantitative information ; the external script is used .
the parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document or the path to project file .
in addition to the mentioned methods , a script input from &amp; quantitative information can be accepted by default . in the selection box input , input can be determined , which is to be sent to the standard entry . options are :
selected text : the selected range of documentation is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only accessible with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two ways of issue : normal output , to the standard issue written ; error messages can be done with which to the standard issue written by clicking the default value output :
if there are many tags in the market @-@ up language , it is recommended to do the tags in logical groups . in the case there are not too many , therefore you can create a tool bar with the name of the market .
once a tool bar is added , you must add actions and configure their settings .
the parts of this window are rather self explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom end of the window will start scanning mode .
fill out all the required fields and add them to the matching tool bar .
complete all and if the day attri@@ bute has and you planning their use , activate the dialog &quot; tag &quot; when available to use one input when using the action .
Ig@@ itt ! is this a ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this icon ? replace it before we have trouble .
to create a symbol that the action is better , we will use &amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; choose from the &amp; k@@ menu ; , graphic more programs ( or where else it is located in its distribution ) .
&amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 Pixel , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select editing size others .
please note that the created icon does not only helps you notice that the action does , but also all other users of the &amp; DT@@ EP ; .
in regard to that the day start , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . due to the use of green ( green is usually interpreted as los , rigid , further interpreted ) , or should select at least to select a message to the user that clicking this symbol .
after creating the symbol , it must still be connected to the action . this is done by the menu with Settings ... ( in &amp; quantitative information ; ) and selection of the required action . in addition to the text box is a button , press him .
choose the folder where the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the user button and continue with other tags , so it gives or confirm to complete with OK .
suppose you want to supplement some usual &amp; quantitative information ; functions to the tool@@ bar or it should set this to better overview by some tr@@ ner in multiple groups . open the tool@@ bars set up with Settings tool . make sure the required tool@@ bar is selected .
I want to choose the separ@@ ator ( quite left ) for my tool bar . after selecting the element , the tool bar is to be added , press the arrow button to the right . this add the element to the tool@@ bar .
for example , I want to add a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar .
please note how to support the group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my tool bar can believe that the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button on the opposite of the start button .
the new tool bar must be tested by test all symbols to ensure that everything works .
ins@@ ure you in the right folder . after re@@ e@@ XML it does not exist , it will be saved in the proper folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the proper file . please adjust your tool@@ bar ( s ) if a file is opened by the appropriate type .
perhaps the chosen extension of &amp; quantitative enlargement of &amp; quantitative information ; for the normal user is the option to add documentation for the script language or the formation of the script which you like a &amp; PHP ; -@@ document tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you could check the &amp; quantitative repository ; Rep@@ os@@ itory if anyone has done this for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to create an existing documentation for the form@@ att@@ ing / script / etc ; -@@ language . then you have to leave the do@@ cr@@ c file . we &apos;ll have to leave the first part we deal with you the second .
# K@@ DE Configuration File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c Do@@ c = Sec@@ 2.@@ 3.@@ html section 2 = Section 1.@@ html section 2 = Sec@@ 1.@@ html section 2 = 0.@@ 1.@@ html @-@ 1 = 0.@@ 2.@@ html @-@ 1 = 0.@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 3.@@ html
section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the document tree . for example , see in &amp; PHP ; documentation so something :
# K@@ DE config file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c You = php@@ 42 / # top level Elements top element = PHP 4.2 Open = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x@@ .@@ html transmission = HTML ... Language Reference = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = pol@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ taxes .@@ html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this shows that it is a sub @-@ folder in tree with its own contents . there is no known border for chess boards ( except through the Re@@ ason ) m@@ d@@ ash , but try it out .
note that the table of contents directly reference to a file is refer@@ enced ( and consistent , at the upper end of the building view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folders will be displayed ! ) .
spaces may affect nothing but do not affect &amp; b &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; quantitative information ; Res@@ our@@ c@@ end@@ at@@ ry can be replaced .
the section of section is the range of do@@ cr@@ c file , which is to be rendered to the design of the context @-@ sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; the documentation of the m@@ ys@@ q@@ l _ fet@@ ch _ array function would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file connections .
a simple list of showing separate context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can easily save your file do@@ cr@@ c and if you are using $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc / DOC / quantitative / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc / DOC / quantitative / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc / DOC / quantitative / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc / DOC / quantitative / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc / DOC / quantitative / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc / DOC / quantitative / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc / DOC / quantitative / doc or copy / quantitative / doc or copy your HTML documentation in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation .
if you are sure that these good and it &apos;s worth to be divided , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. what documentation were used to the &amp; quantitative method ; -@@ Community . they will not be rich , but proud to have been working with the best web development platform .
with &amp; quantitative information ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the separ@@ ator resources ( DT@@ EP packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent via email to friends , partners or else . at different places there is a email @-@ sending menu like DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( DT@@ EP ) with email , tool@@ bar tool@@ bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts .
the resources can be up@@ loaded into our main archive from where all the other &amp; quantitative information ; users can download it , if our team needs them correct and useful for the release . in order to sign a usable contribution , why it guarantees a G@@ PG / P@@ GP keys . this means the source of resources is ensured , both for our team as well as for the later users .
when up@@ loading , you &apos;re asking for their private G@@ PG keys ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not stored ) , or in the case that you have multiple keys , you can fill out a dialog box ( URL preview can remain empty ) and with clicking the OK upload .
the up@@ loading can be up@@ loading from the menu DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( DT@@ EP ) , tool tool@@ bar up@@ loading , and can be started in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts .
after downloading a resource , even before the installation , was examined &amp; quantitative information ; the integrity of the resource could be warned . if the integrity is given and it can be broken down . if the integrity is given and the resource is properly signed , a message appears with the speci@@ fying of the origin@@ ator of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML languages which is currently not being created by &amp; quantitative information ; it can be used to work by a DT@@ EP package . the construction can be time consuming because hundreds of day files can be required in tag@@ .@@ It is easier to change a DT@@ D package into a DT@@ EP package .
converting a DT@@ D menu and converting a DT@@ D menu . select the .@@ d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description which should be used . afterwards , the following dialog appears :
destination name : the newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; is written with this name into the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / quantitative / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! DO@@ C@@ TY@@ PE Defin@@ ed parts : the drawing chain that appear in the ! DO@@ C@@ TY@@ PE tag such as HTML PU@@ BL@@ IC - / / W@@ 3C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional / / DT@@ D HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional / / DT@@ D HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional / / DT@@ D HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional / / DT@@ D HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional .
fine adjustment of DT@@ EP after conversion : if enabled , brings &amp; quantitative information ; after conversion the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; quantitative information ; there are some key concepts . to understand these and full use of &amp; quantitative determin@@ us ; this chapter must first bring to them exactly these concepts , without their understanding &amp; quantitative ; little use .
in &amp; quantitative information ; the working area is divided into three areas : global , locally and projection area . these differentiation concerns a number of components in &amp; quantitative information ; .
global elements are for each , the &amp; quantitative information ; uses , available . from tool@@ bars over actions , everything that is marked globally is stored in the common folder of administrators , actions and patterns in the global tree , which will then be available to each user in a multi @-@ user environment at the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development agent for a single user . that &apos;s custom patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
the project complex elements are available only within a specific project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; patterns up to tool@@ bars with special actions especially for the files of a specific project . simply said this is the most limited size . all elements are stored in the folder &apos;s folder . all elements are em@@ itted by all employees within the project .
the IC@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; MDI ; consists of some main areas : the Edit@@ or@@ window , the construction views , the ant@@ il@@ ions , with information and tool@@ bars . please propose to information and information about these areas .
you can click the mouse button with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current documentation , re @-@ charge , delete or upload the document , jump to an book@@ marks or version of CV@@ S commands to the current document .
legal action in the Edit@@ or@@ zone lead to a further context menu concerning the mach@@ ined tags , using basic processing steps ( copy / copy / insert ) , editing the mouse poin@@ ter or opening the file if the string is described under the mouse poin@@ ter .
at the upper end of the Edit@@ or@@ sters , the tool@@ bars of the Ed@@ itors . currently , &amp; HTML ; 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional files as standard , for which a set of tool can be displayed . in the course of further expansion of &amp; quantitative information ; the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and thus connected correctly needs .
the use of tool aff@@ ord is really easy . if they want to insert a single day , then click the symbol that represents the day . now , you should add the data for this just entered day . if you want to add several attributes ( such as anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog to fill different fields .
the building prospects ( Q@@ IT ; ) allows you to open and navigate in the information about &amp; quantitative inform@@ us ; in the diagram showing cart@@ il@@ it@@ ers are available for files , project , sample templates , docum@@ ent@@ aries , scripts , attributes and documentation .
project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; quantitative inform@@ al . this view shows all the files in the project and allows you to manage files in the project via right mouse click . promotions such as Adding , removing , upload , upload files from the memory medium can be done with which then displayed context menu .
another option of &amp; quantitative information ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : images , program parts , all web page &amp; etc ; There are all possibilities available .
templates can be divided into three categories , depending on the connection they are used . the category is based on &amp; quantitative radius . global templates are always available , local templates only for the respective user and templates in projects are available only in the project . more on templates are available .
here you can find information about the available scripts . the concept of re@@ integration in Global , Lok@@ al and Project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button you can retri@@ eve the available information to a script . via the right mouse button , you can send another functions like the script , edit or send an email .
with this view , shows the internal structure of the active document . the cur@@ sor in the document is set to the position of the element . due to the right @-@ click of an element , the cur@@ sor will open a list of commands to navigation and navigation of the tree .
this tree will appear under the other building prospects . with it , lack of attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces can change . that allows the modification of all available attributes with a few clicks .
here is the documentation of the web technology for your development . it can be downloaded from the quantitative documentation for &amp; quantitative information ; the document site can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be edited , edited and viewed .
by default , &amp; quantitative information ; two cart@@ il@@ it@@ ers at the bottom of the window can be reached via the use@@ able information : the news window and the problem window .
this cardboard box shows information about any in Qu@@ anta running script . for example , the specified DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to the DT@@ D displayed .
this cardboard box shows all the errors in the check @-@ up of the current document . &amp; quantitative scripts that are executed , give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the Fo@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show on a icon and they get the corresponding command . the chocolate set of the tool is the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in &amp; quantitative determination .
a further function of &amp; quantitative information ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with email . &amp; quantitative information ; sends the tool@@ bar as a compressed T@@ ar @-@ Archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if you receive a tool@@ bar in an e @-@ mail , they can secure them in &amp; quantitative information ; how any other backup and load !
it is reasonable when you want to custom@@ ize the location of &amp; quantitative information ; to configure files on your system . in order to get a complete list of all options , enter . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed here .
if you have problems with start of &amp; quantitative inform@@ us ; you should check if your path contains &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folders . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in P@@ AT@@ H in front of her bin folders . same goes for &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; Pro@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; quantitative information ; it was optimized for rapid web development and combines a combined development environment with a variety of powerful features .
during effort , the best &amp; HTML ; Editor began to employ the developers of &amp; quantitative ideas ; what would be if &amp; quantitative inform@@ us ; a stand@@ alone , extended market @-@ up languages ? well , this would make it an absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer on pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; quantitative information ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . together : if you can define it into &amp; XML , then you should be a quantitative &amp; IDE ; for this it is necessary .
now , to the af@@ ore@@ mentioned claim must be noted that &amp; quantitative information is based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ art ; development community is based on the idea of why . thanks to &amp; k@@ de ; rum@@ or is not only this everything possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; quantitative information ; such as they need it for their need .
&amp; Pro@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; allows developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( MDI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool aff@@ ord is possible . by the program comp@@ iling , they can expand &amp; quantitative determination . through the program comp@@ ress it may be able to meet without any scripts . ( more about them find in . )
&amp; quantitative ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been conceived for fast web development and has been quickly developed to a sophisticated editor with many powerful features .
&amp; quantitative ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; quantitative ; the original developers left the GPL @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
for details of the documentation is with help : / quantitative ( either this URL in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; enter or help help : / quantitative ) .
&amp; quantitative ; is currently developing and supported by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon sequences @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access List of files that you have opened . this list changes every time you cannot open a file , which is not included on it , whereby the oldest entry is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . read in the section on templates . should you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template &apos;s template , only an error is reported .
converted into inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board there is special characters to &amp; HTML ; -@@ A@@ ger@@ ation so that they are correct and not understood from browser as form@@ att@@ ing instructions .
converts the text from the clip@@ board in &amp; URL ; -@@ A@@ ger@@ ation , which is the correct way to insert special signs and space characters in &amp; URL ; s . in first line to add &amp; URL ; s are used in the anch@@ ors day .
switches the block selection and off . it allows you to select text blocks with the help of the &amp; Shift .
go directly to a line number . that &apos;s very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; script error messages are out !
sear@@ ches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a type gre@@ p or SE@@ D with GUI and pre@@ defined expres@@ sions to help you .
displays the message window at or not . this is the window where you can see the display of scripts and deb@@ ug@@ ger .
push and en@@ ching of the problem @-@ por@@ ters at the lower edge of the &amp; quantitative ; main window . the problem re@@ porter is activated once you changes to the structural tree .
displays the symbolic link from the main window . this column allows you to insert the wire Bookmark with a mouse click .
when there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu together with entries previous or Next , depending on the cur@@ sor position .
book@@ marks from other open documents appear in the menu group@@ ed according to the file names of the other documents .
opens a existing project from hard disk . &amp; quantitative information ; -@@ projects are stored with the extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
sear@@ ches the project directory after new files that could be there . that allows you to copy graphics files into your project folder or sub @-@ folder and add them to the project .
loads the files in your project on the server . the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; from and if you have downloaded any additional input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings , such as &amp; quantitative information ; the project is managed . chapter &amp; quantitative information ; - Projects find the details .
invites a project tool bar . these are kept in project you / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu when you assign it to this project .
a dialog to store your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : locally or project .
opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this creates only the name . actions need to be added to the machine &apos;s actions . tool can be stored via tool tool@@ bars or you will be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bars .
remov@@ es a tool@@ bar from the field of field . it does not delete them from hard disk . if you have not saved the tool bar , you will be asked if you want to do it .
you can send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; quantitative information ; team , so the tool@@ bar is available in the next release ) . the menu entry will open a new email message with the tool@@ bar as app@@ endix .
allows the up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server wherever each other can access . see in .
loading one &amp; DT@@ D ; you can do or convert any other and convert into the &amp; quantitative form ; own sound format .
download / ref@@ res@@ h the re@@ alities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it is meaning@@ ful if the de@@ form@@ ations from the &amp; DT@@ EP ; to renew it . if this global system is not present and a write permission in the global K@@ DE file is not present , the shop is f@@ eit@@ ed .
this menu contains a list of tags that are loaded into the currently loaded tool@@ bar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current tag dialog dialog when there is one . this entry is always available in the Tags Tags , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific signatures .
activ@@ ates the intelligent insertion of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent insertion means that &amp; quantitative method ; the insertion of the tool is ref@@ using , if this day contra@@ di@@ ct the rules on this place .
plug@@ ins are listed in the plug@@ ins in the menu menu . click on the menu option . click on the menu button . click on the activated plug @-@ ins disabled .
select the syn@@ taxes navig@@ ating mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schem@@ es depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; version from .
sel@@ ects the type of line identification . very useful if you know people running the other OS platforms to the development . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
checks the syntax of the current document , using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; by using the T@@ id@@ y external application .
immediate switching between the various types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , the change@@ over can cause or un@@ nice graphics . it is recommended to the default settings , or the default settings that is the display in &amp; quantitative mode ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu contains an entry for every open window . the corresponding window will be activated .
the display of the status bar stops at the bottom edge of the &amp; quantitative Mar@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window at or from .
the changes in this dialog will include any application that use the K@@ HTML Part , including &amp; Cont@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Web@@ codes .
the behavior of the editors is displayed . in the documentation of &amp; Kate ; you can find details .
a dialog appears in which you can delete entries from the tool@@ bars or change the sequences .
that should generate an help in the mouse poin@@ ter , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; Pro@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a qualit@@ atively high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use assistance . if they want to support &amp; quantitative form ; development in financial support they will find the way here .
the fields are self explan@@ atory and should be filled at the top of the project , since e.g. after filling the project name , the whole directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed automatically with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project features can be set later .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . at the input of name , file is filled automatically .
that is the name of the &amp; quantitative document ; project file . by default it has the name of the project in lower@@ case and without spaces with extension web@@ pr@@ j ( eg . f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can access the machine address of the machine that you want to access local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ example .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 ) are possible .
using this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol may be used . depending on the setting of the remote computer an adjustment could be necessary .
this is the folder where the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a shared collection of files for different projects should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder where the tool@@ bars can be stored for the project . it &apos;s a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a shared collection of files for different projects should be set instead of the standard .
this allows to insert files from the local file system into the project . several files or whole folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you want to download and change static web content you want to download and change . with ser@@ ver@@ able scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc . ) you need to proceed differently .
then , when files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project , are to be mounted . if a project is started from the ground , not hook @-@ hook .
with this option , all files and folders will be displayed within the main folder and you can make a precise choice of good .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files through An@@ h@@ acks or select from the project using the check box .
the latest screen of the new project assist@@ ants contains three settings that can simpli@@ fy your work . these settings can be up@@ loading with Project Properties in the menu section in the menu Line Profile or with the scanning angle Shift ; F@@ 7 can be changed .
some adjustments correspond to those in the project assist@@ ants and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholder is possible ) , which will be re@@ igno@@ red during the project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
complem@@ entary option to top , also files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project .
the project view , which will be loaded during opening the project . in May , more about project views can be re @-@ read .
therefore , the deb@@ ug@@ ger can be chosen . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information on G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plug@@ in can be set with the button options . in addition , trou@@ bl@@ esho@@ oting is described .
in the lower window profiles , high @-@ loading profiles ( see in ) can be adjusted as well as the display of a building view for the content of the server for each profile by poin@@ ter a separate building view for each profile .
in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited , or deleted as well as a ma@@ iling list . see details .
in the sub@@ window event configuration , you can change event actions , change or delete these actions , change or delete . event actions are executed if a previously defined event will occur as about the back@@ ing of a file . see the details .
by default , the Pro@@ ap@@ l@@ us will open ; the last project which was opened . this behavior is currently not influence .
to open another project , select Open Project .... from the menu project or the icon project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog Project is displayed and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as expansion .
if &amp; D@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; closed , the repository is automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving the file if &amp; quantitative files ; changed files . same happens when you load a new project .
the project management provides free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
file behavior is also likewise , but are missing the entries opening and open with ... in the right mouse button on the context menu :
here you can find various profiles . the profile contains information on the place of the up@@ loaded files . see .
allows removing the current profile . if only a profile is present , the button is b@@ lown down to prevent removing the removing .
the password is kept in the core memory and keep in program . this option is useful if common use of files necessary and save the rather un@@ certain password on the disk -@@ option does not come into question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your opinion before up@@ loading .
a lot of high @-@ loading profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be up@@ loaded to different servers . when processing or creating a profile , this dialog will appear :
this is the server name that should be copied to the files . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the Transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and installed K@@ IO slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( locally ) and NFS .
the port for transfer . normally it needs to be changed , except the network administrator runs a service on the usual port .
depending on your anxi@@ ety , this is either a tim@@ es@@ aving function or a danger . use it after your discretion . the password is stored on the plate , so it cannot be read , but each with programming languages can easily see in the plain text .
a project view is only a set of files and tool@@ bars . it can be put into a project many views , i.e. by simply di@@ ver@@ ing the view can be loaded several files and tool@@ bars and replace the currently open files and tool@@ bars .
views can be opened in the menu Project or the Project tool@@ bar , reachable via Settings Machine tool@@ bar , open or deleted .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; quantitative information ; with which one has most to do . this helps not only increase productivity but also allows the adaptation of &amp; quantitative information ; to its own work .
as already mentioned above are tool@@ bars in &amp; quantitative ; best by the menu tool@@ bars . use and adding . Adding tool@@ bars is treated below in the section add tool@@ bars .
the tool@@ bars and the symbols can be set either through the context menu ( right click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which the new tool bar can be set , there can be other actions such as tool@@ bar , tool bar , ren@@ aming , can be specified in the dialogue , where the actions can be visible on this or other tool@@ bars .
by calling the context menus for a tool ( icon ) on a tool bar , additionally the entries will be removed and action @-@ processed , that are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool aff@@ ord and the actions on them can set up in the menu with Settings tool ... and set up settings ..
templates are shown in basic documentation , code @-@ cut@@ el and files for lin@@ king . &amp; quantitative NAS ; uses templates basically as a usual fil@@ esystem with advanced organization and interfaces . you can copy , post@@ p@@ one or any one on the existing folder in the template @-@ tree . templates have templates &amp; quantitative inform@@ ation@@ . in about the restrictions you can set up for the file system .
some articles with &amp; quantitative information ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions at the beginning of any template before use .
binary is all that is not pure text . it can be inserted any file except text , i.e. images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc . binary templates are usually inserted in documents by means of short@@ cuts ( e.g. pictures with IM@@ G sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples are available in the template under global templates . further information about templates are available .
documents can be created from any text documentation . based on this templates , new documents can be created . normally , a simple sc@@ aff@@ le for the purpose and organis@@ es the work in a proper way to be efficiently . some examples may be found in the template under global templates . see for more information about templates .
this type of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area should always be inserted into the documents . you can find everything from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl basis . some examples include templates under global templates . see for more information about templates .
as the name suggests , these templates are available for whole websites as templates . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a file structure , together in a compressed t@@ ar @-@ Archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; quantitative information ; .
transform a document structure to exposure ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and select File As Tem@@ plate , save as local template ....
as soon as it is done , note that ( even if it was stored as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . check out in the fig tree under repository .
select text in your document and click the template to store selection as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can easily be drawn with pulling and finish on the template templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be used in a template @-@ folder . for example , all file management functions can be used , so about pulling and transfer or insert via the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can select in the file tree or in the project files building view to a folder right and backup site template to ensure a name for the template and secure . by default , it will be stored in the repository , but of course it can be used as local or global template .
project templates allow a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can create head@@ lines and foot@@ lines or dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; it can easily add files or linked with them . in addition , you can keep some things when using templates into projects very pro@@ found in eye .
the template &apos;s structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files stored in $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / validation and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / quantitative / apps / quantitative / apps / quantitative / apps / quantitative / apps / quantitative / apps . each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers , as stated above .
in order to define the behavior of a folder with the right mouse button , click on the folder and select the context menu properties . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is hidden as soon as el@@ ong@@ ated attributes can be attached .
this is re@@ activated by default and fits everything except the stem folders . if a stem file would be set there , there would be templates that appear in this path , except they would be explicitly enabled . in case of normal folder , the bl@@ ah would appear with something like Text Bau@@ stein . if nothing appears , it is likely to be in a stem file .
allowed or displayed text for templates in this file . this may be general head@@ lines or foot@@ lines for a particular project and allows to equi@@ p a file with special head@@ lines / foot@@ lines a whole presentation already with the matching head@@ lines / foot lines .
in addition , we have a context menu ( shown on the right mouse button ) via a complete command file for adding folders or copy and insert templates from one place to another .
&amp; quantitative inform@@ us ; provides two modes : V@@ PL ; Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor that can be reached by the menu View . the first mode replaces the source text editor in two parts : source text editor and V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it invites a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and cur@@ sor will appear . then you can edit and select when needed for source code editor , in which the implemented changes in V@@ PL ; editor are visible in source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor on a document that contains &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit these directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; editor , it is not necessary to edit the source editor . there is no plans to change this behavi@@ our@@ al code .
the second mode operates exactly like the first , except for simultaneously running the changes in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor synchron@@ ously running . using F9 , this mode is already active , the scanning pressure is activated from a window to the others , whereby the position is retained in the document .
the synchron@@ isation distance between the V@@ PL ; Editor and the source text editor can be adjusted via settings Qu@@ anta .... by selecting V@@ PL ; -@@ View can be set between synchron@@ ization after a click or automatically . in general , the recommendation can be adjusted automatically . basically , the recommendation is : a small pot for fast calcul@@ ator and a large sp@@ range for slow .
suppose you want to change the title of the website , so it is possible to choose from un@@ visible tags when working with the V@@ PL ; Editor is also called once a new document with the V@@ PL ; editor is also being created . this is the user to change the suspension system .
met@@ a @-@ tags allows the storage of information about the document itself e.g. drums for Internet search engines . met@@ a @-@ elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons on the bottom , e.g. key words in column names and key@@ word key@@ word Key@@ word Key@@ word Key .
CSS rules are the new way to design the design of pages in browser . you can add CSS rules with the buttons under the list or delete . a change over the list is possible exactly as with the met@@ a elements . the editing of CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to insert a external CSS style system by clicking on the file button and select the corresponding file .
the cur@@ sor of cur@@ sor is like in a text processing due to the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances , the cur@@ sor resi@@ des itself . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted by entering and by pressing a button button .
the insertion of tags will be made in the same way via the tool@@ bars , as in the source text editor . it is necessary to note that the insertion of tags will not be removed before@@ hand , e.g. an anchor @-@ day , sur@@ round with text , must any other ambient anch@@ ors are removed .
some tool@@ bars such as the Tab@@ les @-@ assistant or the lists are disabled . you will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; you will need to work tables or lists tool@@ bars later in this release .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the examination of sty@@ list@@ eners . in contrast to other programmes for sty@@ list@@ eners , the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of sty@@ li@@ aison can be tra@@ cked .

on systems with installed Re@@ ad@@ line library you can send the following commands to / from the exp@@ iry of the previously done commands .
several commands require more than an argument . contact signs can be used to put together expres@@ sions as an argument . &amp; eg ; : using the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BAR _ @ quot ; &quot; as an argument , a holding point in a file with the name &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BAR _ @ quot ; . &quot;
template _ Name : a valid name of a template that exists only from the ASCII character 0x@@ 00 up to 0x@@ 7@@ F . this name can be a fully qualified name like &quot; X@@ SL : tem@@ plat@@ e@@ Name . &quot;

there are many graphic tools to compare . why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain shortly I have written .
the merger was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors had made many changes and at the same time was changed to many places . another programmer had changed much text in the same file . the result were numerous conflicts in the merge .
the program used by me showed me only the modified lines , but I could not see what had changed within these lines . and there were no evidence on the passages where perhaps only the entry was changed . the merge of these changes was a small night@@ mare .
that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; detected differences in line and amendments to white characters . later , any amount of more useful features were added .
if you would like to compare it fast text , copy it simply into the clip@@ board and insert it in one of the comparative window .
a function done much work was the comparison and merge of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost in a full file browser .
also 3 @-@ way mer@@ ging is fully supported . this is useful if two persons can work independently of one piece of co@@ de and changes the original file . in this editor you can even edit the outcome . in this editor you can even edit the result . the screen photo shows three Qu@@ ell files when conducting :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; helps you also perform the same and merge folder . this screen photo shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; at the folder mer@@ ging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and en@@ dow@@ els the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you often have co@@ de , you will like this function .
differences in white signs and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed visible . if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters you can see at a glance at the summary in the column on the left @-@ hand side . ( no trouble changes if any one changes the in@@ wards . )
if a file is equal , and the other distingu@@ ishes itself in one line , then the color indicate that the file is different . red color means that both of them differ .
if all files have the same name , but in different folders , you can make sure the ti@@ pp@@ work will make you complete the fil@@ en@@ ames of the first file . example :
diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 1 folder , diff@@ 3 folder , diff@@ 3 folder , folder , folder , folder , type 2 folder , folder , folder , folder
the opening dialog allows manual mounting of fil@@ en@@ ames , select the selection of file names . the opening dialog will notice itself your selection and displays it at the next time . if you leave the entry for C empty it will be the analysis of the differences with two files .
over the button file ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the same or merge files will be selected , for B and C , however , uses a folder , then uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; file names from A in both other folders .
if mer@@ ging is crossed , the input field is active for the objective . however , it is not necessary to define a output file immediately after saving .
the setup button brings a dialog with Settings . here you can set options before you start with the same / merge .
sometimes one would like to compare all the file but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparative window . the comparison starts immediately . in opening dialog , you don &apos;t need to select files , you can simply close the dialog with the retri@@ eve button .
you can also use gyp@@ sum and shut@@ down : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from a editor and let it fall on a comparative window .
what thought is behind this ? sometimes , a file contains several similar functions . if you want to figure out what these functions are , it would have to put two corresponding files , they would like to copy and compare these relevant sections . now , you can easily copy and compare the relevant sections .
note : currently you can pull out nothing out of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the feeling of text in a comparative window is supported .
warning : some editors interpreted the pulling and transfer text into another program as slic@@ ing and insert ( instead of copying and insertion ) . in such a case , your original data could perish .
in the upper part of each text window is the info line . the info line contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ames and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window is optional . ) Any info line has different colour . ( if the path turns to a file , leave the mouse over the line . then a small relief window will display the full name . )
the three spring star are assigned the letters A , B and C . A has the color blue , B the colour green and C is mag@@ enta . ( this default settings can be changed via the settings menu . )
if a difference is recognized , you can see on the color , which file is different . if both files are different , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the colour scheme is especially useful if you compare three files . that &apos;s good in the next section ( merge ) .
left next to the text is the inter@@ locking column . when differences were found , the column displays the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + , e.g. white characters only relevant in character sets and comments , for the pre@@ processing and in few , rare cases relevant . )
the vertical line that separates the summary column from the text , is interrupted at the places where the respective source file is not activated . if the line breaks is activated , the line will be displayed on broken lines .
the result window ( below the comparison window ) has also a info @-@ line with the inscription issue : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; Ge@@ changes &#93; if you have handled the result . usually , it contains the automatic merge text , but often also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts have been dissolved , the store is de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use the buttons to the next dissolved / un@@ solved conflict in order to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparative windows are used , each difference must be lo@@ osed in the same time a conflict that must be manually dissolved .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows the group is displayed in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed . ( this will also be a jump from the position in the windows where the first group is otherwise visible . ) This group will be highlighted by the color background color for current section and on the left shows a black bars .
sometimes it remains below the automatic merge or by manual processing no further line more in the group ; there is only a plac@@ eholder for the case that you can change your opinion , and perhaps to select another source . this text does not appear in the final stored file , still in a marking which you might have to copy and anywhere else .
the text &amp; lt ; assembling times ; but appears in the clip@@ board if you copy the text from the output window . go out carefully with this function .
note : if the sources check the options are igno@@ red or igno@@ res C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are treated like white characters .
this will navigate mainly with the picture sequence and mouse , but you can also use the arrow keys to the left , right , down , down , side down , side down , C@@ tr@@ l @-@ beginning and C@@ tr@@ l @-@ end , Si@@ w as well as you can also use it from other programs . the excess columns can also be used to navigate to the navigation system .
in the eye window , you can also use the other buttons to the edit menu . with the insertion button you can switch between plug @-@ in and sli@@ deshow mode . ( default is the insertion mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the inter@@ connection columns is synchron@@ ized to view all windows at the beginning of the respective group ( as already in the merge and the ed@@ itable output window ) .
the tool bar contains seven buttons to the navigation with which you can jump to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture shooting down / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture down@@ ward ) or to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture messages ) or to the next / previous conflict is still considered conflict . hence , the conflict has to be distinguished between sol@@ uble and un@@ solved conflicts .
in order to copy the markings to clip@@ board , you need to copy the copying button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l @-@ insert ) . if this option is enabled , you will automatically select the clip@@ board automatically and automatically copy the manual copying . if this option is carefully selected , because you might have the contents of the clip@@ board .
Z@@ eil@@ ing are stored according to the underlying operating system . UNIX variants are using a Z@@ eil@@ en@@ c@@ ub @-@ sign \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not ret@@ ains the c@@ row ending of the source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also do not use bin@@ aries on bin@@ aries .
the options and list of the most recently used files will be stored automatically and re @-@ produced at the next start . ( menu Inclu@@ sion &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... )
choose a font with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog also provides scriptures with variable width to choose from , you should not use it . )
if you activate this option , differences in cur@@ sive writing will not be displayed . if the selected font doesn &apos;t support this representation nothing happens .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in its pure form , but would be displayed automatically . in these systems the button pres@@ ets automatically an od@@ d color .
when this option is activated , pressing the button button , the corresponding number of spaces inserted will be inserted . otherwise , a tab @-@ character will be inserted .
if you press input or return , the insertion of the front row will automatically be used for the next line .
when this option is enabled , any selection will automatically be copied to clip@@ board . manual copying into the clip@@ board then .
you can choose which Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ende type you prefer to store . the default value is the common option on the used operating system .
while the same of files tries &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first to find all full identical lines in the source files . just during this first step , white characters can not be igno@@ red . in this step , white characters are not igno@@ red . in this step the white character will not be igno@@ red .
some editors ( on some systems ) store a car re@@ sign &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a row , but then they could only save a line @-@ side comparison , although they are different . if this option is enabled , car return marks are visible , however , like a white sign . during the merge , this option must be de@@ activated . in the default , this option is de@@ activated .
the default is de@@ activated . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated signs ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; -@@ &apos; ) are igno@@ red , but the differences are still indicated , but they are treated like white characters .
the default option is de@@ activated . changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters .
intensiv after even smaller differences . the option is activated in the pres@@ et@@ ting . it is effective for complicated and large files , but slowly at very large files .
in the Autom@@ atically @-@ Jump mode , this setting , how long the results of the selection will be displayed before the next un@@ loaded conflict is passed .
trig@@ gers automatic all conflicts in white characters by selecting the chosen file as a source . ( default , manual selection . ) This is useful if white characters occur in many files . note that the automatic selection also causes conflicts to numbers or comments if the options are igno@@ red or igno@@ res C / C + + comments .
these options are treated in the chapter of scanning of folders and runs through a merge . look for details on documentation on the directory comparison and merge .
if a file is stored and already an older version exists , then the original version of Suff@@ ix . if already an such backup file with the suff@@ ix .@@ original exists , this will be deleted without any additional backup .
adap@@ ts the language of the user interface . this option does not change the current program . you must finish &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; stop and rest@@ art to change the change . ( this option is not available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; because the language is set globally through the control centre . )
the following code settings can be adjusted separately for each entry . if using this option , the top settings are used for all entries .
about the selection fields for coding the coding is a short notice that is the local coding . ( this may not be changed , and have it purely inform@@ al character . )
adjust the file encoding for source files . this is how special characters can be treated and interpreted , as the encoding for each file can be adjusted individually , even files with different coding can be compared and merged .
if you have processed a file , you can determine which coding is to be used .
if you define pre @-@ processed commands , they could not work with your codec . ( for example , your files can operate 16 @-@ bit Unicode , but the pre@@ processing command can only establish with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can determine the coding of the output commands .
turn this off to supp@@ ress the emphasis of changes in white characters in text or overview . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are igno@@ red or igno@@ res C / C + + comments . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences in a color coded over@@ clock column are displayed . but sometimes you might only see the differences between two of three files ; B , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C will be displayed next to the normal yet a second excess column with the required information .
sometimes one would prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply enter the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
the comparison takes place next to each other or to each other . this can also be useful for ads of long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes , look at the differences and decide to merge the files . a simple click starts to merge the merge menu and uses the file names of the last source file as the default name for output file . ( if this function is used to rest@@ art the file , then the name of the most recently used output file is retained . )
when reading a file it is visible first to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor , which corresponds to your requirements . you can use this function for example , or to correct the deposit .
when reading a file it is given first to this external command . if also a standard pre @-@ processing command is given ( see above ) , then the output of the command is used only . you can write your own pre@@ processor , which corresponds to your requirements . each input line must have an associated issue line .
the thought behind it is to allow users more flexibility when setting the sealing results . however , an external program is needed , and most users would like to program that . good news is , however , that in most cases SE@@ D or per@@ l is completely sufficient .
use this pre@@ processing command for line compensation to the input in upper@@ case letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ U \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ &apos; s text in the first character string . the \ \ U converts the found text in upper@@ case .
for example , CV@@ S and other ver@@ sion@@ ing systems use some keywords in automatically generated character strings ( info : / c@@ vs / key@@ word \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you experiment with SE@@ D , you might get to understand it and perhaps you may also like this regular expres@@ sions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
this igno@@ red by numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of a further pre@@ processing command for Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ab@@ o . SE@@ D &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a suitable matches , and any hits will be replaced by nothing , so virtually extingu@@ ished .
sometimes you might want to perform several stories at once . then you can use the Sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the translations of each other . example :
instead SE@@ D you can also use anything other such as per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ G@@ EX@@ P / replacement / switches &apos; allergi@@ dings are needed in per@@ l some details different where SE@@ D \ \ ( and \ \ ) requires per@@ l only ( and ) without the four \ \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor will maintain for display and merge . the other operations change only the data that the line @-@ off @-@ al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus can change .
note : in rare cases if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the line @-@ off @-@ pre@@ processor provides the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the processor commands are very useful but as with each function that changes the text or differences , you can &apos;t notice certain differences , and destroy important data in the worst case .
often , programmer need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders recur@@ sively compare and merge .
... makes for each object a proposal for merge ; you can custom@@ ize the proposal before starting ,
... can sim@@ ulate the merge and show the sim@@ ulated changes to do without it ,
... brings the selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) or only with the selected objects ( F6 @-@ key ) ,
this is the same and merge of single files very similar . you only need to open folder on the command line or dialog file .
if three folders are joined , folder 1 is used as base . if no target folder was specified , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folder .
note that only the comparison of the folders will not start , do not start the merge . to select the menu item , select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( further details follow )
while reading the folder you will be informed of a small message window over the current progress . if you remove the scanning of the folder , only those files are listed , which were compared until then .
if the scanning of the folder is finished , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a listing window with the results on the left , ...
any file and folder created during the scan , click here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the file structure is normally folded . you can fold a folder , by clicking on the + / - click on the object or by clicking the arrow keys for the left / right . the directory menu contains two functions all sub@@ directories inside and fold all sub @-@ directories with which you can open all folders or fold .
if you double click on a file , the file expi@@ res and it appears a comparative window .
the icon in the column Name reflects the type of file type in the first file ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the type of file is different in the other folders , then it is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detailed window to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action can not automatically be chosen . if the merger will start , you will be informed of the problems of this type .
as shown in the above picture , columns A / B / C are red , green , yellow and black .
in identical entries , the color is identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folder are considered as identical , if you are all the content is identical . then the folder also have same color . at folders the age is ir@@ relevant for its color .
the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . the colours reflect the colors of a sheet , which is only green , then yellow becomes and later when it is old , red .
... A and C is identical but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C does not have the same file type ( e.g. if A folder and B is a file ) : errors : contra@@ dic@@ tory file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects cannot be started .
... A and B does not have the same file type ( e.g. if A folder and B is a file ) : errors : contra@@ dic@@ tory file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects cannot be started .
the mode to synchron@@ ize mode is active if only two folders and no explic@@ it target folder were enabled , and if the option directories are synchron@@ ized . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action therefore are identical , so that both folders are identical . if necessary ...
... A and B exist but not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees the visible file name for the output file only B ; directly after the merge &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
if two folders are assembled and select the option of new file instead of inter@@ connection . if the files are different , but the same date are different , but the same date is identical , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange such error cannot be removed , the merge of the folders can &apos;t be started .
while bringing a file after the inter@@ connection , you will show a file after the interaction where the merge has been successful , and according to other messages when a result is un@@ expect@@ edly , you should make a final review and see if the status is OK .
when selecting the file method , the diff@@ 3 file method is selected , K@@ diff@@ 3 is selected further columns . these contain the number of coun@@ ters , sol@@ uble , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for sol@@ dered conflicts will be displayed only if three folders are compared or assembled . )
you can either perform the just selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all inter@@ ro@@ dent actions ( also in all subjects ) you can start the merge .
please note : if you have no target folder , then in the three @-@ folder merge mode C is used as a target , in the two @-@ folder sequence B is chosen as target and synchron@@ ize A and / or B as target .
if you have selected a target folder , please check whether all entries should be displayed in the target folder , even in the file size , there may be some options due to specific entries . check these options for un@@ pleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : select directory entry / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the scanning root ) . to add just the current entry , select action of the current element or press F6 .
if due to contra@@ dic@@ tory file types still exist , a message appears to be printed on the def@@ ective items . you can then select a valid promotion for them .
if you merge all entries , a dialog window will appear with the options that sim@@ ulate and break sim@@ ulations .
choose Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen , without changing the really changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all the actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then certain actions with all the entries needed . if a manual procedure is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window will open ( please note the screenshot ) .
if you are ready to start with a file , select directory @-@ merge or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t yet saved , a corresponding dialog appears . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 will continue its work with the next entry .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on an error , message appears and detailed status information . at the end of the list you will see some error messages which you should help to ski@@ p the cause of problem . so you have the option to select another promotion for the entry , or to solve the problem in any way before using the merge .
if some entries were merged individually , please note &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries are not yet recorded in the current session . even if it has been taken up , these entries will be considered . only if you do not change the merge action , these entries will be merged again .
the settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called directory interaction with these options :
only files that are displayed on the displayed pattern are displayed in the element tree . separate the samples with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default file is not equal to this pattern .
files and folders corresponding to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered into the element tree , use the Sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a separ@@ ator sign . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . pre@@ set is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O .
files and folders corresponding to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered into the element tree , use the Sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a separ@@ ator sign . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . pre@@ set is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O .
igno@@ red files that are also igno@@ red by CV@@ S . many aut@@ mat@@ ory produced files are igno@@ red by CV@@ S . the big advantage is that this folder can be set with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see below info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ signals . )
in some file system files have a leading point . in other file systems selected a leading point . this option lets you decide whether these files are displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in the default component .
links to files : if the option is switched , symbolic short@@ cuts are compared . if the option is turned on , the files will be compared to which the links are de@@ activated . this is de@@ activated in the pres@@ et@@ ting .
links to folder : if the option is switched , the links are compared to normal folders . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; please note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; please note to a folder of a link itself would lead to an end loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; crash@@ es off . ) This option is shut down in the pres@@ et@@ ting .
this is a complete analysis of each file through and displays the statistics columns . ( the number dissolved , inv@@ ents , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower if it is applied to files that does not contain any text . ( enter an appropriate anti @-@ pattern ) .
if you compare a large folder through a slow network , it may be easier to compare only the change date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security . please use the default option .
similar to the change date . there is no real comparison taking place . the files are considered to be equally large . this option may be useful if the change of change has lost . please use caution . this option is used in the default value .
activ@@ ates the sync mode when two folders are compared and no target folder was specified . in this mode , the suggestions have been selected so that both folders are identical . also the results of the merge files are stored in both folders . this option is shut down in the pres@@ et@@ ting .
if there are differences , the copying of the newer file is proposed as a action . ( this is considered uns@@ af@@ ably , because the other file does not change the other file . ) This option is shut down in any case . ) This option is shut down in the pres@@ et@@ ting .
if a file or a folder will be replaced or deleted , the original version is renamed and gets the extension .@@ original . if an old backup file is already exists , this will also be deleted without further backup . this option also affects the merge all the file . this option is switched on in the pres@@ et@@ ting .
normally , the folder sequence View would remain visible in the merge of individual files ; you can switch the window divider with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want to switch the window directory and text window , you can switch the window directory and text windows to switch between the window and text window between the two views .
probably , you prefer to compare a file simply by double clicking . however , you can use a single file directly connected directly without the folder . as soon as you can save the folder , the status will be done again and the file will not start again when you start the folder .
however , this status is lost , if you re @-@ read the directory again : directory - menu : re @-@ read
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folders to open , which are located on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax for local files and folders . some things you should note :
a path can be relatively being . or .. included . that &apos;s not possible with UR@@ Ls , these are always absolutely .
special characters must be m@@ asked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , spaces &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file with the name / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes by the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it can not be distinguished whether a link is displayed on a file or folder . then a file is accepted as a link goal . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no possibility to edit permission or change of change . ( note that the per@@ missions or change of change from the original . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose of main purposes is currently as differences viewer in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op starts to start the built @-@ in differences viewer . to start K@@ diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the differences viewer and then select In K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part view from the context menu .
normally you need &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . if it is used as a K@@ part , adop@@ ts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names of the original files from the Patch @-@ File . at least one of the two files must exist . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 must recover the missing file .
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu . please note that this does not work if any of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable when the original files have changed since generation of Patch @-@ file .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; when Part is executed , there is only the same of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . the merge or the same file size is not supported in the K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( well @-@ it com@@ missions ) is already available . furthermore , the name K@@ diff@@ 3 indicates that there is diff@@ use as the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff Tool collection .
I have been using GPL programs already very long and have learned much in the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all the program@@ mers passed this way or go it way .
you have already compiled the program from the sources and configure the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in default , K@@ DE will not find resources for user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file , you will find more information about this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are covered as identical ; but if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line will not be identical as it is not identical . if it is not identical , this is the next to Each Ter@@ is , but this is the case .
the editor will notice for each difference in the files where it begins and ends . this is necessary to solve one conflict simply by clicking in the source text and select the result simply as text file and it is too much effort to create extra a separate file format that could save this information .
the effort has been too large so far . you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to process large quantities of text , another editor should be used .
after removing the text is suddenly lt ; no sr@@ c left ; appeared and the text can &apos;t be clear . what does this mean and how can this be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; used many colors to increase sub @-@ differences . even more high@@ lighting would be conf@@ using and conce@@ aled the purpose . please use a different editor .
many good ideas and error reports arrived from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all the functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later .

cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ Remove ) copies in the clip@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or envelop@@ es ) add text from the clip@@ board to the current cur@@ sor position and replaces the current selection .
only differences : files that are identical in all folders can not appear in the folder , and therefore not in the target folder .
( in current program version you need to read the folder to these options using the function actu@@ alization . )
only entries are displayed , the differences are indicated that identical files are not already copied to the target folder . if the target folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after the merge . ( the behaviour is likely to change in a later program version . ) This option is shut down in the pres@@ et@@ ting .
note the buttons to choose from the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you have attached to one of the buttons , the lines are attached to the end of the selected group ( if they are not already available ) . if the lines are already available , click on the button again automatically .
in the default option this option is de@@ activated . under@@ differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; shows a miniature show of all virtual work@@ space . it is quite practical to change the current programs on the work@@ space , to change their size or move it . this works both within a desktop and several .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work areas as well as those of the current applications . the applications can be selected and can be moved even on the desktop and in other areas .
with the middle mouse button window can be moved within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both within a desktop and other work spaces .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; if , if you click on an application within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; if , in addition , the icon and the name of the application also appear to maxim@@ ize , maxim@@ ize , in mind and finish . commands are the following :
maxim@@ izes the use window for the full size of the desktop . appears only if I cli@@ cked on a application .
send the application to selected virtual desktop . appears only if I cli@@ cked on a application .
if this check box is marked , window can be moved inside &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and can also be moved to other work areas .
when this field is crossed , in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , the names of virtual working areas are displayed .
Cross@@ ing this field leaves the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager to view the numbers of virtual working areas . it is equipped together with names , the names will be ordained , &amp; eg ; 1 . mind .
when this field is crossed , the background of each desktop will also be shown as a background in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager .
when this field is crossed , the current programs are shown as a small window in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only the empty work@@ space will be shown to make their selection .
here is the view of the program window . simply shows simple rectangle with the propor@@ tions of the program window . symbol shows the window with its standard symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of actual program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classic and k@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n @-@ grid , how out of P@@ ager @-@ applications appear in some other windows ; horizont@@ ally shows all virtual working areas in a horizontal row , which is very good for the display side on the desktop .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager miniature program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size to display the window as symbols or with their content . furthermore , he runs outside the control bar .
click the right mouse button within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and subsequent alignment of switching switch ... lets the dialog box appear .
at the moment , the settings can &apos;t be changed in the settings , but you can do it manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / config / k@@ p@@ ag@@ err@@ c with any text editor like e.g. &amp; ke@@ dit ; or else . if you have no write permission for the file , you have to register your system administrator or to assign to your system administrator . in this file , you have to present the key win@@ dow@@ er mode and assign it to this value . possible values are :

&amp; k@@ mag ; it &apos;s a screen magni@@ fying . you can use &amp; k@@ mag ; if you would like to use a magni@@ fying preview for different users : this application include artist , web @-@ designer and people with a vision . this documentation is said to be a complete manual for use &amp; k@@ mag .
&amp; k@@ hi ; is a very powerful application which is constantly improved for new functions . it is optimised for use on high @-@ performance computers .
if you like &amp; k@@ art , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; displays the enlarged area of the screen . in the following window will be displayed as a magni@@ fication window . the picture , which is displayed in the magni@@ fication window , is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as a selection window .
in the default setting &amp; k@@ mag ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter is like a mobile phone . alternatively , you can get a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( selection box mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse poin@@ ter on screen ( eg ; on the left screen ) .
if you want to avoid the mouse poin@@ ter in the enlarged window , select the mouse poin@@ ter . please note that &amp; k@@ mag ; currently not able to detect the form of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the default ; / Q@@ t ; mouse poin@@ ter .
in the selection mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouth buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following ways :
move the mouse over in the magni@@ fication window and hold down the left mouse button , so you can move the contents of the magni@@ fying window and move it with the arrow keys .
if you enter the &amp; shift in addition , press the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the selection window .
with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the selection window will remain and only the lower right corner is moving .
&amp; k@@ mag ; possesses a lot of features . you can copy the enlarged image directly to the printer , to copy into the clip@@ board ( to insert it later in other applications ) , turn the picture and much more .
or stops the updating of the display . the stopping voltage causes the required CPU time to 0 .
choose the ref@@ res@@ h rate ( Very low , Straight , medium , high , Very high ) . the higher the ref@@ res@@ h rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a selection window will be displayed . the selected area will be displayed in a window .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click immediately after the mouse poin@@ ter a while on the same spot . it is intended to help people who suffer from the RS@@ I syndrome ( repet@@ itive fatigue syndrome ) and of which each mouse click pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click on the same spot . it is intended to help people who suffer trouble with the repet@@ itive in@@ eration ( RS@@ I ) syndrome and of which each mouse click pain . furthermore , it does not require a little exercise .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain , which arises during clicking the mouse , and helps many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you suffer pain , who are associated with the use of your computer , should consult a doctor if this is not yet done .
to make it clear : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pain helps with the mouse , it is against pain caused by clicking the mouse , us@@ eless . and as in all ergonomic support tools , the result can vary for each different .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click once you turn off the movement .
is the intelligent shift activ@@ ates , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break after pressing the mouse button . move the mouse to run with the mouse button . this way you can perform the pulling on the mouse button . the intelligent move requires a little exercise , but you get used quickly .
this re@@ tention time must be stopped after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click .
is Intelli@@ gent@@ it shift is enabled , the recovery time delay time ( 1 / 10 s ) is set . here the time is set , the mouse button is waiting before it can release the mouse button when the mouse button is un@@ locked once again .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now , clicking with mouse shi@@ fts . is this function enabled , generates a slow move to the right and back to a double click . these movements are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt for the first time , however , they can be changed later .
if the sound is delayed , you can move &amp; k@@ de ; to move the response time . open to the sound and multimedia , select the sound system and here the rider . there is a sli@@ der sound buffer , which you set to a lower value to reduce the response times .
if this setting is marked , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is marked ; at each start of &amp; k@@ de ; started . this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; available at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please check the respective documentation to find out how you start a program automatically .
set all the settings back to the values that were stopped when opening the dialog . have you already pushed the button to use the settings the stand after the last pressing of user .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; initially with the default settings . in particular , intelligent shi@@ fting should first be switched off . if you get used to the automatic mouse click , you can later get the intelligent shift .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it will be necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; to reduce sounds .
first , you should be aware of which places a mouse click without effect : clicking on the neutral production of windows or on places in browser window , which cannot represent free reactions . you can use the mouse on such places until you want to use it again .
if your mouse is printed , you should clean your mouse . it is normally pretty easy . the trick is very easy to clean the mouse , but also the rolls that come with the mouse ball in touch .
first you need to remove the mouse ball . as it happens , is from mouse to mouse . it should be clear when you see the under@@ side of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the sphere was used . dirt and dirt is easily scra@@ pped with a flat blade or the fingers .
in very rare situations , the operating system opens the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; when you use the intelligent shi@@ fting system , meaning that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool means that operation cannot stop using the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use a window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem exists that you own a mouse click . in this way the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool will be reset , and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and sets the cur@@ sor into a different place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor into place where you want to make it . however , if you don &apos;t want to bring your mouse on a neutral area of your desktop , if you don &apos;t want to bring out the mouse on a neutral reactions . secure zones for the mouse poin@@ ter is &amp; eg . secure zones for the mouse poin@@ ter and menus and the cover lines of windows .
I tried to work with intelligent shi@@ fts but I don &apos;t create it to edit text .
the intelligent shi@@ fting is a advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time to circum@@ navigate to this text , to copy it into the clip@@ board , if you want to move it into the clip@@ board , if you want to move the mouse when you want to move with the mouse button . however , there will probably be some problems again . here are some advice about it :
do not use the intelligent shift if you just start with &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; select text instead as follows : take a mouse click at the end of the text area , while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and once again the mouse button .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . in this way , when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool will play a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when using an intelligent shi@@ fting . later , you can use the intelligent shi@@ fting also without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but it needs some exercise .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window ; installed , that should be the case in most system .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and loud speaker .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; entered the mouse button as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter short . this program was developed for people who suffer from the RS@@ I syndrome and preparing the firm of the mouse button pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to make sure that a pulling process begins , before the mouse button begins . in this way the pulling and shut@@ down can be carried out with the mouse .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that allows the dum@@ b user to talk to their computers for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; you can choose the computer for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the conversation statement that should be spoken once again .
on the first side of the assistant ( left @-@ screen ) , enter the command , which later is used for speech output . further details can be found in the description of the setup dial@@ ogs .
on the second page you can choose the default text@@ books . from the text@@ books you can choose to choose passages without need to tap . the text@@ books can course be processed .
on the third side ( right @-@ screen ) you determine the dic@@ tionary for the word . &amp; k@@ mouth ; read the code documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words . additionally , you can download the word lists with a Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org Dictionary , so only correct sp@@ elling words are taken into the word .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clearly structured and essentially contains a input field for the key@@ ing agent of your propositions ( the lower white field in the screenshot ) and a circul@@ ating memory of the phr@@ ases ( the upper white field in the screenshot ) .
if you choose it , you can enter the phr@@ ases that you want to listen in the input field that you want . each sample set is attached to the disk space . you can choose from propositions which should be spoken once again .
with the menu entry settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the dialog dialog for &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two maps , speech output and settings , the page Wor@@ ter@@ ran@@ ch as well as the side of K@@ TT@@ SD language service .
in the input field of the box map edition , enter the command to the call of the Voice Command . in the select field you specify the string coding , using the text to the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two types to pass on the text . select the check box when the text is unchanged as a default output generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be re@@ produced as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholder :
of course , the command on your language generator depends on your language generator . this command you can find in the documentation to your language generator . examples of this command can be found in the app@@ endix .
if you are looking to pass as a language service , you will need to pass &amp; k@@ mouth ; as the first try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which is a standardized interface for voice output , which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . option of this option is meaning@@ ful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection box action after selection of a text passage you determine which action is triggered by the key@@ word or by selecting a text passage in the menu text @-@ pass or in the l@@ ath for text agen@@ das .
with the selection of sauce speaking , the chosen passage passage will be inserted directly and additionally inserted into the disk space . the selected text passage will initially be entered into the input field only .
in the second selective field closing of the processing window for text box book you can determine if the textbook book when closing the processing window will be stored automatically .
with the selection of text box book , the book is stored . if you choose any changes , the textbook code is not stored . select Before Save , it is &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the textbook book shall be stored .
the page Wor@@ ter@@ ti@@ fication contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the word . in the main window shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box , if this list contains more than a dic@@ tionary . with this selection box , you can choose the current dic@@ tionary to the word .
with buttons on the right you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries or add the order of books or modify them into a file . below the list you can set the name and select the language for the dic@@ tionary .
choose the language you want to choose the language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; read the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation a . the frequency of each words is simply determined by elim@@ ination of performances . additionally , you can compare the word list with a Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dic@@ tionary , in order to insert only correctly written words into the new dic@@ tionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask what dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they are to be punished .
this option lets you create a new , empty dic@@ tionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly introduced words automatically into dic@@ tionary , generate a dic@@ tionary using your voc@@ abul@@ ary .
the main range of the window to the processing of text@@ books is double @-@ divided . in the upper part , the text@@ books are displayed as tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have chosen a text passage , you can change the passage passage or the corresponding scanning process . if you have chosen a textbook book , you can change only its name .
you can obtain actions like new text@@ books or books or delete attach@@ ments and books either via the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a hing@@ ed menu .
the sequence of text@@ books or text passages you can change with mouse to the new place or by the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; key .
the chosen text is cut out and copied to clip@@ board . if the input field is selected , the text section is selected , otherwise the selected areas of the drive storage .
the chosen text is copied to clip@@ board . if the input field is selected , the text section is selected , otherwise the selected areas of the drive storage .
the currently active sentence is spoken . if the text is in the input field , it will be used otherwise , otherwise the selected phr@@ ases in the circul@@ ator is used .
if this menu entry is crossed , a sliding tool bar is displayed with buttons for frequently used commands . the tool@@ bar is arranged by default on the menu bar directly under the menu bar . by mouse click on the scra@@ pped left side and pulling the tool bar can be moved to another place .
if this menu entry is crossed , a narrow l@@ ath in the lower part of the main window with hin@@ ts over the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; indicated if not crossed , this status bar is b@@ lown up .
if this menu entry is crossed , a sli@@ dable glue for text@@ books can be displayed with entries . the bar is arranged by default on the tool@@ bar directly under the tool@@ bar . by mouse click on the scra@@ pped left side and pulling the tool bar can be moved to another place .
likely , you probably have not been entered the command for voice output not right or not fully entered . open Settings ... , open the page general settings and enter the command for voice card speech output . ( see setting dialog for voice synthesis on further details . )
the festival is a speech output system of Edinburgh University . currently , only English , Spanish and W@@ alis@@ isch is currently supported , the license allows to use the festival free of charge and spread without restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting the speech output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival , and then the command to language output is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is a player and Java ; written language generator . currently , it only supports English original language . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS free of charge and spread without restrictions .
in order to show an example of the command line for setting up speech output , it is estimated that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ ett file . language output is then possible with one of the three following commands :
for the third example , the option must be switched on as standard entry . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . he converts a list of phon@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , therefore you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ eme . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert German text in phon@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , under the assum@@ ption that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA in / usr / local / her fax and / usr / local / mb@@ rol@@ a are installed .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax loves to be the last sign of the text , so that an additional character must be submitted . the complete command is therefore more complex than in the other examples :
( CAT - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / mb@@ rol@@ a / de@@ 1 / usr / local / mb@@ rol@@ a / de@@ 1 / t@@ 1 / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; art@@ board / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav
all parts of the command must be written in one line . option data as standard entry must be switched on .
the Voice Spe@@ ech of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language service , which is provided by all &amp; k@@ de ; uses a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice output systems .
since setting the Voice Command is only done in K@@ TT@@ SD , you only have to use as possible language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ;
to setup , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which is installed in the dialog dialog for &amp; k@@ mouth ; if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; successfully using a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ mouth ; 3.x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additional memory for voice generator ) , which depends on your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people who cannot speak , text through the calcul@@ ator . it will be saved on a list already sung phr@@ ases that the user can re@@ spend again .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no language syn@@ thesizer includes . on the computer , a language syn@@ thesizer must be installed .

filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ops ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ops ; filters are not required .
fil@@ tering will be processed , before he will be sent to the application of some disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving the language or ab@@ brevi@@ ations , to select a right language and speakers or to handle certain defic@@ ien@@ cies of voice synthesis and their voices .
in order to understand the work of fil@@ tering , it is important to know how the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is works with a text and distingu@@ ishes four types of texts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the output of Screen Re@@ a@@ dern has the highest priority . it will be submitted to all other orders and maintains this com@@ missions . if the output of the screen reader is read , the requested orders will be resum@@ ed again .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important messages like &amp; eg ; processor is going to hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of news and normal text . these orders will be resum@@ ed after the issue of the warning .
messages got the next top priority . a message is breaking off normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example for an application to read messages . while keeping &amp; eg ; a long text can be read on a website , you can welcome you with &amp; k@@ mouth ; noti@@ fications are also news . read about it .
the rest are simple text orders . each order you encounter orders from the card card is a text job . KS@@ ay@@ it is an example of applications that are used for text applications . text orders are intended for the issue longer texts that have no special dr@@ in@@ ability .
all four order types are processed in qu@@ eu@@ e long with the exception of the output of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application will send the output of a screen reader , while &amp; dict@@ ts , this issue will stop and finished .
first , you need to know that filters never be applied to the output of Screen Re@@ aders . they will be applied to normal warning , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages are applied .
filter process the text and give it to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future , there can still be more types of filters .
replace parts of a text by different text . which can be used to specify parts or as regular expres@@ sions . &amp; dict@@ ts ; will be supplied with pre@@ defined character sets , which allow the replacement of chat @-@ emotions ( such as : - ) by text or for conversion of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; into a better under@@ stand@@ able form .
&amp; XML ; trans@@ duc@@ ers use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format into another format . contains some X@@ SL@@ T files to the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; included in SS@@ ML .
you can send any orders on the text of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; dict@@ ts ; if you have set a female voice to the text , you can read text by K@@ DE messages above that you can read about it . Si@@ don . read about it .
each of these various filters have set adjustable rules , according to which he used for a language issue . if the filter specifies that his rules do not apply , he gives the text unchanged at the next filter .
if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; call is sent , it will be processed by all the activated filter that were set up on the side down . the processing caused by the filters in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of pitches normal filters . if a filter is not crossed , it is not activated and is not used . filter will be activated from the top to the bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and the next dialog boxes will be displayed below .
to set up a list of words or regular expres@@ sions as comparison models , these patterns will be exchanged in the text , then the text is exchanged against the corresponding replacement text . large and small statement is not observed when compared with the text .
enter a name for your filter . this name lets you choose between the name of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expres@@ sions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the character strings in the column agreement and replaced it in accordance with the string . the list is executed in the displayed sequence from above .
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
with these buttons , you can upload a list of words or regular expres@@ sions from a file to save the current list or delete a list of file the entries must be attached to the existing list .
here is a language registered , the filter will only be applied if the speaker for the text order is one of the registered languages . click on the button to select a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you press the mouse click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; key .
if a value is entered here , the filter will only be applied if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can type multiple programs separated by comm@@ mat@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID running programs will be available with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; D@@ bus ; numbers must be w@@ asted . if using &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the user ID amp @-@ 34@@ 32 indicates that you can only enter .
the fil@@ esystem filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions with an entry in the box Di@@ es@@ Filter is used . if all input fields is empty , the filter will be applied to all texts .
when comparing words used in the form \ \ s word \ \ \ s word \ \ s , the words must be limited to both sides by divi@@ ding signs ( spaces ) .
in this manual you will have no manual to write regular expres@@ sions . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can call it into the dial@@ ogs add or edit : &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions can be shown in the package .
&amp; XML ; trans@@ duc@@ ers transl@@ ate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from one format in another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML Language ) is a W@@ 3C standard for such circumstances . but it can only be applied to well @-@ form@@ alized XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c option must be installed on your system .
specify the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is reachable via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is enough .
using the microphone filter filters you can send texts to a specific speaker , which is set up on the card card speaker , or to a speaker with certain features . you can determine that text by k@@ mail should be read from a female voice . see .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text to the filter is looking for a speaker for the text . the speaker is chosen to send the text to &amp; dict@@ ts ; the speaker is chosen to send the text to &amp; dict@@ ts . the spokes@@ person for the speaker card is set up with the spokes@@ person filter , you can ski@@ p the selected speaker .
if the filter is registered here , the filter will be applied if the text does the entered regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can call this with a click on the button to obtain assistance during the input .
to achieve a faster processing , you should try to em@@ it the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
set the properties of the desired fil@@ tering process here . if the text meets the fil@@ tering process , the speaker is selected , which meets the desired requirements at the most likely . click on the button to view the dialog box selection .
use these buttons to store your microphone settings or delete all the settings .
the spokes@@ person filter is only applied to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ visions filter if needed . you must have at least one condition .
the language API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with the programmer to give its applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , which is added to the K@@ TT@@ SD language syn@@ thesizer , so that they can use syn@@ thesizer .
the following section includes a brief description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Interface ; interface of the language API from &amp; k@@ de ; the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is will be found on the k@@ de ; Acc@@ essi@@ bility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / -@@ bil@@ it@@ y.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .

none of the mentioned language syn@@ thesizer supported my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have created the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; internal filter filter , but when using the module for the festival web pages are not read .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you need to install the ( male British ) Voice Rab _ di@@ phone that does not work even if you do not use this voice to read from web pages . furthermore , please ensure that the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program will not be installed and find the variable P@@ AT@@ H environment .
certain signs or inter@@ section characters seem to cause errors like syn@@ thes@@ izers , so complete movements are transmitted or only Kau@@ der@@ wi@@ l . what can I do against it ?
make sure that the encoding option is set to the right value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with certain signs or words , these may be fixed by a character set filter . see .

in order to comp@@ ile ; comp@@ ile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including the packages and the development files for the program &quot; O @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
if you have downloaded the sw@@ elling of &amp; kt@@ ts ; you have downloaded the source code for k@@ de@@ bit or downloaded each night currently with Tar@@ ball , and install the program with the following commands :
before you can use &amp; kt@@ ar@@ er ; check first if you &apos;re working correctly with your voice syn@@ thesizer . you can use the Sh@@ ell@@ script SPD @-@ conf .
&amp; Mi@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ar@@ cher . the program at the program of the t@@ ms@@ g should be further developed and the program is not possible that the set @-@ up of some disp@@ at@@ cher is possible and the script SPD @-@ conf is no longer required .
a long text is de@@ composed into individual sets . the user can return the sales or decrease in advance , let the output stop or break off .
if an application text goes to &amp; kt@@ ts , it can request the characteristics of the preferred speaking speaker . if you have a speaker , whose language is English and whose family is female , it will automatically select the best appropriate spokes@@ person . if you want to learn more about it , how &amp; dict@@ ts ; you will see a speaker you will see in .
if you click on the folder icon , click adding a speaker into the list or click on the pane , the cartridge card device for the Festival Interactive is shown below . details on the modules can be shown below . details on the modules below .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable program . if the path takes place at P@@ AT@@ H , you only need to enter the festival only .
choose the string coding for the text that will be handed to Festival . by voices , the &amp; dict@@ ts , this setting will automatically be made automatically . generally , Western languages ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 use Eastern languages like Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these shooting sites , you volume noise , speaking speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you can not select a few kno@@ b and display this gray , the chosen voice cannot be chosen these settings .
some voices such as Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices require several seconds to be charged . if you mark this check box , these quotes are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that ( with greater memory consumption ) the first movement is faster .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet created a speaker ( or don &apos;t forget to use the user ) .
if this check box is marked , it is displayed at the start of dict@@ ine the program window . otherwise , after the start , only the symbol is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon to display the program window .
if this check box is marked and stopped , it does not appear in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD is displayed a text as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD is displayed a text . thus , you have the possibility to read or anywhere else .
here are all the orders listed in the maintenance long , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of propositions and the just worked set . the speaker ID corresponds to the ID ID on the card card speaker .
with the buttons in this series you can proceed to the order , which is selected in the list below , pre@@ - or return . ( but not each order consists of several sets ) .
click OK with a click on OK , all changes to the settings ( also on the other card cards ) and kt@@ ops will be reduced to the icon in the system section . then click on this icon to view the program window .
if the sound system &amp; Mozart ; it is not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click the audio card audio . see also .
here are only text orders listed and manages . editions of Screen Re@@ a@@ dern , War@@ ts and News will not be displayed . more information about the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in .
select the type of audio output . if a component can &apos;t be selected , it has been sent , either without support for the corresponding audio module , or can &apos;t load the necessary libraries .
if you want to use G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de for audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you need to install at least one module . do you choose the PCM device here . see also
set the microphone speed here . 50@@ n@@ bsp ; % corresponds to about half and 200@@ n@@ bsp ; % corresponds to the double normal microphone speed . thus , these settings can be implemented , the program must be SO@@ X installed .
click on the user to adopt the new settings for the running &amp; kt@@ ops ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices comprises all PCM devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you need to find out what device works with you . in doubt , choose the standard .
on this map card you can setup special actions which are always executed if the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts , processes four types of language orders :
the output of Screen Re@@ a@@ dern has the highest priority . it will start all other orders and maintains this com@@ missions . after issu@@ ing the screen reader is read , the requested orders will be resum@@ ed .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important messages like &amp; eg ; processor is going to hot . a warning keeps the output of news and normal text . these orders will be resum@@ ed after the advance of the warning .
messages got the next priority . a message is breaking off normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example for an application that talks messages . if you find &amp; eg ; just a long text can be read on a website , you can now welcome you with &amp; k@@ mouth ; yet someone welcome you to enter the room .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen reader , add &amp; ref@@ ts ; the audio output in the waiting time is long .
this audio file will always be played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both the introduc@@ tory sound is active as well as the introduc@@ tory message , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this card card are only valid for normal text applications . for messages , war@@ nings and expenses of Screen Re@@ aders , there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; K@@ emer@@ gen@@ eric messages can be displayed , start c@@ eded and click al@@ er@@ ts . the noti@@ fications notification shall appear .
check this check box to enter the preview of &amp; de ; dis@@ advant@@ age@@ ous devices . if this setting is not marked , the remaining settings are de@@ activated and sli@@ deshow ; do not read al@@ er@@ ts .
if this setting is marked , al@@ er@@ ts will be played , where a sound is played , from &amp; dict@@ ts ; not read .
use these buttons to add events to the list or delete it . if you click adding the button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and event you want to add to list .
this event reads your message before , the &amp; conversation ; sent if som@@ eb@@ ody mentioned in an I@@ RC message records your nick@@ name .
all events , for which in the list is nothing else , are igno@@ red by &amp; dict@@ ts ; igno@@ red .
use this selection box to determine what &amp; dict@@ ts ; to do when an event takes place . you have the following selection :
if you have chosen custom text , enter the desired text , you can use the following plac@@ eholder :
you can enter the properties of the desired microphone station . standard sel@@ ects the speaker , which is displayed in the list on the list card spokes@@ person as the top entry . see also .
note that there are three levels for events . is specified for a specific event of a specific application . otherwise , the action will run for all other events of the specific application . the last possibility is to carry out the action , which was defined by default ( all other events ) .
the event of all al@@ er@@ ts for the application standard ( all other events can not be deleted from the list , as follows :
use the button stores to save the settings for the al@@ er@@ ts to a file . the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click on Del@@ ete . all entries will be deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3C standard to mark the text for a voice output . in addition , stamps for the control of voices , speaking voice , gender , gender , and pitch . also marks the control of the output of ab@@ brevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ice@@ XML specification , an additional W@@ 3C standard .
currently support &amp; kt@@ ops ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you need to install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) since this is the standard vote , the festival is used in the SS@@ ML issue .
if the settings for speed or audio system in the Festival configuration dialog does not set to 100@@ n@@ bsp ; % is configured , the SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ ot@@ on .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and pro@@ sy filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . SB@@ Ds must begin with reading , since only the first set is syn@@ thes@@ ized , not the complete text order . thus , you can jump on the card card orders full or ski@@ p or break , even if the language syn@@ thesizer is not directly supported .
here you can view the pro@@ sy filter filter . when the first start of &amp; kt@@ ops is automatically set up . you can change its settings , or add additional sat@@ in @-@ borders filters , but the in@@ exhau@@ sting is not recommended .
at the easiest you will learn to setup the device selection from and enter text to the device . switch on the card selection once again , change some features and check how the sel@@ ections select . for this purpose , you have to set up more than a speaker , otherwise the filter is inv@@ alid .
&amp; ref@@ res@@ h ; then fast with the reading can start , since only the first movement is to be processed and not the whole text block , which can take very long ,
you can then stop text orders on the card card or break , even if the voice synthesis of this function does not support this function .
for these reasons the normal set @-@ level filter is automatically set up when you start at m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be removed only . do not change anything at this filter unless you know what you do .
compare the text with a regular expression for pro@@ positi@@ onal and add a table sign ( dec@@ imal code 8 ) to the set limits ( dec@@ imal number 8 ) . note that the default buffer filter is automatically removed from the text .
S@@ BD Filter will never be applied on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News ( k@@ J ) , war@@ nings , messages or the output of Screen @-@ reag@@ ents .
if you have removed the normal set @-@ level filter filter , you can add it again by clicking the cur@@ v@@ c file and it contained in &amp; kt@@ c file ; it contained in the standard _ sb@@ dr@@ c file .
using the microphone panel , you can write the microphone settings for application . the card card will be displayed if
use of the standard speaker ( the top of the card card speaker ) . with other words : no speaking features are set .
use of the pass@@ able microphone , which has all the features of a set @-@ up spokes@@ person . if you do not want to delete or edit the settings of the speaker ; otherwise sel@@ ects &amp; kt@@ ts , the speaker , who originally set up the originally set properties .
select the method for input of the desired microphone characteristics by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
choose the characteristics of the desired speaker . if this feature doesn &apos;t matter , you will give nothing .
check this check box when the property will have priority ahead of other features . you can also set several markings on this box .
as the language is a critical factor when the output is , it will always be treated as a priority feature . the only case if you possibly want to specify the attri@@ bute language , if you know that a certain application text in another language as the number introduced in the working environment .
to use all the features in the area , use the most likely to be clear , click on the select kno@@ b standard speaker and then apply on spokes@@ person who is the most likely to the following .
in this case there is 0 for the last text order in the maintenance long . you can also specify a order number . ( without a order number , input 0 is required ) .
kt@@ ops crash@@ es immediately when it started . I compiled Deb@@ ug support , but I don &apos;t get back tra@@ ce@@ ability .
G@@ stre@@ amer is down by G@@ stre@@ amer . probably , you need to register G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x the command G@@ ST @-@ register @-@ 0.8 . if the problem is not solved , possibly a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try to upgrade or un@@ install G@@ Stre@@ amer .
the audio output over AL@@ SA is not working when I play at the same time with another application music . if I hold a text order , free@@ zes &amp; kt@@ ops ; a message appears that says : -@@ to open PCM .
on your system , the problem is that conflicts to occur with AL@@ SA who perform a simultaneous opening of several PCM devices . indications for possible solutions can be found on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ projection .org .
I downloaded an additional voice for the festival from the internet . I have installed them and can &apos;t use it in the festival , but kt@@ ops don &apos;t show this voice .
add the new voc@@ abul@@ ary to the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / Wave / Bur@@ m@@ ons . as a guide you can serve the other items . if it is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; where you have found the voice to the developers .
on the map audio card there is a setting speed . so that this works , the program SO@@ X installed and can be found on the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . some Syn@@ thesis modul@@ us like Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed . depending on the chosen voice , it is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the microphone speed are igno@@ red when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; ( this is that the HTML code will be converted into SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; ( see ) or if you are very cour@@ age@@ ous , change the .x@@ yz file of &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML @-@ ROM , and set up the microphone speed .
I don &apos;t create that websites with a female voice will be read . I have created a female Festival spokes@@ person , but &amp; kt@@ ops ; read the websites with a male voice .
at the Festival 1.@@ 95 beta the day S@@ able Gender does not seem to work . so , the X@@ SL file th@@ rows the X@@ SL file to converting SS@@ ML to S@@ aber the gender @-@ tags . the same is true also for VO@@ ICE tags .
I have added a separate string solution filter and now I can go back in &amp; dict@@ ts ; not more sat@@ in or return . on the box re@@ iter , the order is displayed only from a proposition . what do I do wrong ?
point of inter@@ section ( point , fragments , relief mark , com@@ ma and Sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) are not allowed to fil@@ tering these characters instead of a filter for movement detection .

some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts in the audio issue . if your system also counts , you can &apos;t play music at the same time , if you want to start playing a text order and then launch a text order . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) .
as of July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de hasn &apos;t added any real breaks . if you keep a text order in &amp; dict@@ ts , the current set will still be read .
the SO@@ X audio program is used for the general setting of the microphone speed , but otherwise no longer required . Deb@@ ian users can install SO@@ X with the command ap@@ t @-@ get install SO@@ X . the program is already included on most &amp; Linux ; CDs already included .

Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer , its source code is generally good . the quality of the voices is generally well , and there will be several voices and languages . by many voices you can adjust volume , speaking speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ts .
you need to install at least a language . help you will find in the instructions that are supplied with festival . you want to read the websites you need to install the ( male British ) Voice Rab _ di@@ phone .
for this voices you need to comp@@ ile an additional module , therefore you need the source code from the Festival . the German votes are subject to limitations .

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; controller center , which enables the management of network interfaces , the rout@@ ines and the DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; allows user to manage a series of system and des@@ kt@@ op@@ settings via a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ control@@ center can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ control@@ center .
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was developed to enable users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ controller center ; enable the areas of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple surface for the following tasks :
after installing a new module network settings in &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ control@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; k@@ menu .
it &apos;s important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical tools and their drivers have to be installed and configured , thus &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device is at all and allows the setup of network features .
in most cases device drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed when installing &amp; Linux ; installed and installed . these network devices are later added , the drivers must be loaded according to the kernel version , according to the kernel version :
the network settings will be loaded when selecting the network settings in &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; -@@ Index is chosen . when start of the module network settings , this is automatically recognis@@ able by the system on the system .
if the platform can not be recognized , the pending selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to select the distribution and release candidate . by selecting the attitude Not @-@ once again , the definition can be taken permanently . at the next start of network settings , this selection will automatically be set automatically .
changing the network settings can be displayed only in system management mode . before , all options are displayed , however , changing the settings can be viewed . in the system management mode you can get in the system management mode at the right end of the module . it is necessary to enter the password .
in system management mode the complete functionality of the module is available . these are divided into three riders :
the rider network interfaces serves to manage network devices of the system . all available network devices will be displayed . from the network interfaces , the following tasks can be carried out :
selecting the displayed network interfaces can be setup by selecting the desired device in the list and click the button ... in the dialog device .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click on the button to view the dialog with further out@@ going options .
with the selection Autom@@ atically the TCP / IP settings are carried out by a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP servers . the D@@ H@@ CP@@ - or BO@@ O@@ TP servers will provide all necessary TCP / IP information on each system , therefore no further setting is required . in the selection list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP should be selected according to the system .
with selecting Manu@@ ally no D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be made to the TCP / IP configuration . the input field IP address must be specified in the input field net@@ mask is the sub@@ net@@ mask .
if this setting is marked , the system initi@@ alized the network interface during bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization isn &apos;t desired , this option should not be activated .
the values presented in this dialog are displayed as the characteristics of the device in the unit box .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . the input of an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console ; you can determine whether the required address is already in use . in doubt the network administrators should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched on depending on your needs . if an inserted network device is performed by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
network devices can be activated or switched on . off an activated network device is carried out by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
specifies the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net which gives the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets .
if your computer is more than a network interface , the interface must be selected on the network where the Gateway computer is selected .
a computer with DNS support replaces the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the computer is ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ cl@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , the DNS trig@@ gers this name into an IP address like about 12@@ 3,@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the calcul@@ ator for the name screen is a simple administration of this list . entries can be added , removed or change @-@ .@@ DNS @-@ entries can be removed by selecting a entry and up - or down@@ gra@@ dation in the list with buttons up or down in priority .
by clicking the button add ... from the group computer to name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will add the dialog for the new name server .
first you have to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button add . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
from the group computer to name screen , select one entry and then click on the Edit button .... It will display the dialog to do it .
the list of well @-@ known calcul@@ ator describes host name @-@ to @-@ IP address modes for TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily on bo@@ oting if no DNS server is available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS servers .
normally , the list of well @-@ known calcul@@ ator contains some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv6 addresses support . this is still the latest version of IP should replace in the future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known computer and click adding .... The dialog for New alias is indicated .
to enter the name of the well @-@ known host and add the button . if the well @-@ known machine has several alias names , de button add several times and enter the other alias names .
select an entry of a well @-@ known host@@ esses from the list and select Edit .... The dialog to edit your computer icon will be displayed .
one of the following tasks can be executed , then with clicking on OK , the list of static hosts will be updated .
the settings made in the network settings are not effective immediately in the system . to dis@@ able the changes , the following command must be removed in a &amp; console .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the newest version of the source code .
for installation of the binary distribution ( usually rpm @-@ packages ) it is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users . it is simply downloading rpm package and install in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively a tool can be used with a graphic interface as a package or the installation tool of its distribution .
for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; not , but also the development packages with libraries and other things are needed .
this is recommended only experienced users . however , it is not difficult to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should aff@@ ord this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology will be discussed in the second , all by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; alter@@ able configuration files are discussed .
this area can &apos;t replace more information about IP networks . in this app@@ endix only basic information on the integration of the PC is convey@@ ed into a small ( home ) network .
at present , IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IPv4 ) . IPv4 is not expected to spread much spread . from IPv6 it is expected to continue in the near future . this description is therefore concentrated on the widespread IPv4 .
one of the most important information is the knowledge that the IP address of a network interface is due . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg ; workplace is the network administrators to the contact address , which can be a valid IP address , if available , the IP address can not be selected as desired !
when setting up an own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be chosen for this purpose to avoid IP address options using the global network ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded to the Internet , therefore its any use is possible .
of course you can access the Internet for such machines by setting a g@@ at@@ ew@@ ays .
for smaller networks most addresses are used in the range from 192.168.@@ 1.1 to 192.168.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the power mask is usually set to 255.@@ 255.@@ 25@@ 5.0 so that all computers are connected in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .0.0 and 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own computer ) . the default route is needed for the IP address .
the 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 network address is reserved for the IP traffic in your own machine . usually the address 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 is assigned to an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works as a closed circle .
in this part , the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; and where they are stored in different distri@@ butions .
this file is changed dynam@@ ically in DSL connections , so it will not be surprised when in case of active DSL connections , it is not to be found there in case of active DSL connections .
for &amp; SuSE Linux , it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another status as expected can occur .

&amp; dat ; is a program for tape drives on the basis of t@@ ar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on one tape . the first goal was to create a surface for t@@ ar , which presented the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ t@@ ar for quick , selective out@@ pack . the second purpose was the answer of a question that my wife set : how much longer lasts when you sec@@ ures ?
before a tape can be used , it must be mounted by &amp; c@@ dat ; it can happen in three ways :
&amp; dat ; d@@ ented the band back and reads the pre@@ st@@ ressing of the tape . det@@ ects &amp; c@@ dat ; the prec@@ anc@@ er on the band will not be asked if the band is being format@@ ted .
recogn@@ ise &amp; dat ; the case is looking for the suitable index on your disk . can this not be found , you &apos;ll be asked if the Band@@ index should be re@@ created .
everything has been smooth , changing the icon for the tape drive to indicate that the tape was built . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched for the band .
prior to the exp@@ ir@@ ation of the ban@@ ker , first the entry must first be solved . there are three methods to make this one @-@ digit :
&amp; dat ; there is a modification of the symbol for the tape that the connection for the tape was solved and shows a corresponding message in the Status Bar . the band can now be cast out without any danger .
before a volume of &amp; c@@ dat is used , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; dat ; format@@ ted .
a band @-@ species must be format@@ ted before you can use a tape before use . if your band has to be format@@ ted , this process requires that a tape can be format@@ ted before use . the floppy disk drives cannot be format@@ ted before using the tape image . floppy disk drives usually use a form@@ att@@ ing of the belt ahead , D@@ AT drives on the other hand .
after entering the band called and the capacity goes &amp; c@@ dat ; with the form@@ att@@ ing of the band . all the data on the tape are lost ! after completion of the end process the band is automatically embedded and is ready to use .
before you encounter the backup procedure , you need to select the secured files . that can happen on three ways :
choose a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folders can be secured .
select a back@@ ing profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are secured .
in local file tree , mark files in a local file tree . only the selected files and / or sub @-@ folders are secured .
click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and choose from the back@@ ing menu ...
once the backup re@@ directed , the dialog for backup . in this dialogue , you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup .
when you confirm the settings , the dialog appears to backup . the dialog shows the progress of the securing process , including data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archive for the drive . only the selected file or folder is checked .
select the files in one of the archive for the band using a hammers . only the selected files and / or sub @-@ folders are checked .
click on the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry .
once the test procedure started , the dialog for checking . in this dialogue , you can check out your selection and change the working folder for review .
if you confirm the settings for check , the dialog appears to verify that this dialog shows the progress of the test process and data throughput and the remaining time .
before you can use the restore , the files that are to be recovered can be marked , which can be selected in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives created for the tape drive . only the selected file or folder will be recovered .
select the files from one of the archives with a hammers . only the selected files and / or sub @-@ folders are recovered .
click with the right mouse button on a file or folder in one of the archives and select in the menu recovery ....
once the recovery procedure started , the dialog for Rest@@ oration . in this dialogue , you can check your selection once again and change the working folder for recovery .
if you have confirmed the settings for restoration , the dialog appears again . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process and data throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes it is necessary to re@@ build the band inde@@ xed file using the band content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can use the index to two types of the tape :
this ensures a back@@ ing profile with the straight marked files and default settings . you can set the following settings for a secure profile :
the current working folder in which the backup should be carried out . the list of the files will be automatically updated according to the just chosen work folder .
for all folders that are listed under backup files , only those files which are listed on the same file system , as the folder . folders that are on other file systems , you can find separately under backup files . each entry will be viewed by t@@ ar regardless of the others .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file is used . only the files have changed since then .
the name of the file , which is used for determination of changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snap@@ shot file before the call of t@@ ar . this causes all files to be secured and created a new snap@@ shot file for the next backup .
the functionality of buttons files &amp; gt ; lt ; and lt ; files was not completely implemented at the time of compilation of this documentation .
you can set up the settings via the menu item ... in the Settings menu . the following settings can be done :
the complete path for the device module for tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding variation of the belt .
is this setting active , transmitted &amp; c@@ dat ; before the band is connected to the drive . in some drives this is necessary before read or write operations .
is the option switched on , try &amp; c@@ dat ; to lock the design of the tape drive . possibly this setting will not work on all band@@ drives .
if the option is turned on , the tape can be activated automatically when loos@@ ing &amp; c@@ dat ; automatically use the tape . do not use this option at Flo@@ ppy Stre@@ am@@ ers .
is the option switched on , tries &amp; c@@ dat ; the hard@@ standing block size for tape drive . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you need &amp; c@@ dat ; in any case the block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape is format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only prove a memory block on the tape . the content of the file is composed as follows :
( N Byte ) The volume ID . the format of this character set is the host name : seconds , whereby the host name is the full name of the system has been format@@ ted on which the tape has been format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that has been format@@ ted since the ep@@ och in which the band has been format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
the remaining files on the tape are pure t@@ ar @-@ archives that can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - t@@ ar . even other t@@ ar versions should work as long as it is no incre@@ mental f@@ uses .
check the contents of a backup tape . this symbol is only active if a tape is mounted .
&amp; Clean Systems log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system protocols . the program is for in@@ experienced users who can &apos;t know where you can get information about your system or where the system allows the different protocol log ; experienced users with fast access to the example of information on your server .
&amp; Clean Systems log ; helps users to understand what your computer makes in the background . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who can not know where you can receive information about your system or where the system is deposited into the different protocol files .
furthermore allows the system log ; experienced users with fast access for example on problems related to their server . &amp; Clean Systems log ; therefore attempts to provide some advanced functions , with their help the protocol @-@ files will be filtered and evaluated .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 and the system log , a series of useful features . these include among others :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and will be explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you see in the following screen photo shows &amp; co@@ aching log ; functions are available , with which help the single protocol lines of a protocol file easily fil@@ tering and sort out . the individual possibilities for s@@ orting and filters will be shown in the next chapter of this hand@@ book .
after the start was trying to open the system log , first the most important protocol file of the system - the system log - will not be displayed , and it does not run with system administrators . the protocol files usually find under Linux normally in the folder / var / log , for the normal user usually have no permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter according to a selected filter indication . the list of the log files will now automatically be displayed , so that only protocol box contains the entry to the selected filter . in the default setting , a protocol line contains only displayed if in one of the columns the string range of the filter search is included .
you can also select another entry in this spot . the string of the filter search term will then only be chosen with entries in the selected column protocol . in addition , select the system log in the name of a trial , so will show you &amp; co@@ aching log ; all protocol lines are sent or compiled by this process .
this option is activated in the default settings and helps you recognize the key protocol lines . protocol lines of the level error are displayed using a striking colour as a protocol @-@ line accuracy . the colour representation of protocol lines can be switched on dialog dialog .
would you only show a specific process ( e.g. in the system log or in cr@@ on protocol ) , so you can check process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a particular command as for example to the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bar .
in addition , you can jump the option to new lines in the context menu of the main window to view all new added protocol lines .
&amp; Clean Systems log ; allows you to open multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to open this feature , use the entries in the menu windows to open additional sub@@ pane and manage . once you select a window , select a protocol to display .
&amp; Clean Systems log ; has its own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / ks@@ Systems log@@ .@@ forum @-@ software tw@@ are@@ .@@ or@@ g D@@ ort you will find further current information about the supply of supply systems .
&amp; the system log , you can also find in the following folder of &amp; k@@ de ; Subversion Archive : ks@@ system log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather well known ( and in the following also called ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ;
the system V In@@ it develops quickly to the standard for control of the program system in the &amp; Linux ; world . therefore , because it is easier to use , more powerful and more flexible than the traditional BSD @-@ in@@ it .
I will not go on historical aspects here ( for example , because I don &apos;t know about it : - ) .
the In@@ it bin@@ file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because someone could try to make a machine on system V In@@ it without a new installation and re @-@ format . this is why you need to ensure that the old in@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the SY@@ SV In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files in a sub @-@ folder of / etc are instead of directly in / etc . this file is called r@@ c.@@ d. D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot scripts . basically , you need to launch a script for each system service , which you want to change to another run@@ level . system services include such things such as network , NFS , &amp; sen@@ mail ; , ht@@ t@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things like set@@ serial that will only start once . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should lie down under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you require it . most systems have this file , even if it is actually not much use . you can also leave a r@@ c.@@ serial / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial connection to do with the serial port .
the kernel is looking for different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one finds it .
the standard margin is listed in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see a line like the following :
at this point , you can cast a look into the second column and probably notice that the default portable run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change it , then you can upgrade to the in@@ itt@@ ab . if you have something different , then you will get it to re@@ boot the system and run the following :
but how do we get all the right scripts ? if you enter l -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no right files in this file . instead , every entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
how does it start and stop system services ? very simple : each of the scripts is written so that it accepts an argument like start and stop . you can actually start this scripts like by hand on the command line as follows :
this would read the ht@@ t@@ p@@ d server . it reads the name , and if the K includes the argument , the script will stop using the argument stop . if it includes an S , the script will be called with the argument start .
some people want a simple way to set machines for many purposes . I could have &amp; eg ; a server running level , that can only run ht@@ t@@ p@@ d , &amp; sen@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . , I also could have a user -@@ Run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc .
here you can learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; you should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another hand device is simple to say not tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry out of the available system services to one of the six round level to start on this level ( or stop using this level ) .
you can move the scripts between Run@@ lev@@ eling or change the position within one level by moving it anywhere else . this will not only happen if you go out an entry in the availability of the available system services .
note : entries are moved when you go into a new range . in order to copy them to a new run@@ level , you need to choose copying files from the menu or from the context menu -- even then if the same entry has already existed in the target range of the promotion .
the sor@@ ption number of an entry can sometimes be calculated . in such a case you have to edit the s@@ orting numbers of the ambient entries before you can try to insert the system service .
note : there are currently no possibility to restore entries that were thrown into the rec@@ ycle bin . so be careful not .
you can use the tab button to activate the various operating ranges ( available system services , run@@ level 1 Start , run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection of upper or below the previous ones .
to move an entry into another round level , move it with cut into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it into the desired run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to manually change the number or names of a single entry , press the dialog button to switch between different fields . connect the dialog by repe@@ ating the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the menu file require a confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . def@@ aults to the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) . otherwise it will be produced by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the default settings are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have failed to experiment with the Standard Run@@ lev@@ eling and now starts the machine resistant . what can I do ?
enter the L@@ ILO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input key to start in a single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the default margin to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it is intended to run in run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you use &amp; SuSE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , then you need to edit additional files into / etc that are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution .
the way how system services are started in these distri@@ butions , but does not simpli@@ fies the configuration of the propri@@ etary adjustments of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; planning an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using a different distribution , please check whether all configuration files are needed ( and also if they are in the proper directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache and ht@@ t@@ p@@ d ) termin@@ ate simply without message if its configuration files are not available or false .
the importance of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version differently . if you use a different distribution , please send more information about the run@@ level , so that this manual can be added to this manual .
this documentation is based on &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . using this program you can manage the user and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is enough to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user .
after you have made changes , you have to save this . either use the respective icon of tool@@ bar or record Save In the menu file .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two cart@@ oning cards , the user and the user group . to edit the required users or the required group with a double click on the entry . it appears the dialog for user or group properties .
some card cards are displayed only if you have extended system settings . only if you can make space restrictions ( Qu@@ ota ) for users , a card card will appear on which you can make individual settings . further cards can appear , if shadow pass@@ words or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes are installed .
the password file management appears if shadow pass@@ words or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as well as in BSD @-@ Unix .
this card card appears only if you are activated and initi@@ alized on at least an embedded file system ( Qu@@ ota ) and initi@@ alized ( recogni@@ z@@ able by the quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here , there may be parameters for each user , with space restrictions on the data contained in KB :
this parameter can be selected individually for each file system . the current file system is selected using the field fil@@ esystem with space restriction .
the card card groups informed about the group &apos;s sen@@ su@@ prem@@ acy of the selected user . the user group , to which the user belongs , find in the field of Pri@@ m@@ ites Group . furthermore , the user can select in other groups by clicking this in the large field .
the dialog box contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or a group , select adding the menu user or group or click the matching add @-@ button of the tool bar . the processing or del@@ eting of the selected users or the selected group works analog .
with this module you can install the L@@ ILO boat Manager , remove the boot word , remove and change the time to boats of the standard operating system , remove the default system system , remove operating systems , change and more .
