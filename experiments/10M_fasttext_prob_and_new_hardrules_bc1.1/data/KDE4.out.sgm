<seg id="14">The peculiarity of & fsview; consists of a rectangle with the help of a so-called Tree-Map graphically. each object is proportional to its size, whose area is proportional to its size. this size must have the sum of the size of the subordinate objects of an object smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">In & fsview; reflects the size of a file or folder, whereby the size of a folder as the sum of the size of entries is specified. consequently, you can easily be detected if they can be viewed below in the folder hierarchy, it can be viewed as a graphic and interactive version of & UNIX; command you can be considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & fsview; is an entry in the Treemap-representation a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your file system. to simpler navigation possess the rectangles practical application and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The colour of a rectangle that is switched over to view of color mode, may either display depth for easy detection of the appearance and figure of other file names like name, proprietor, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle may be labeled with the various properties of the corresponding file or folder. for each feature you can determine if it is at all, only if sufficient space is present or if the area may occur by limitations in the sign of the Treemap. in addition, you can set the relative position of the label in rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">In point algorithms for treads, the surface is proportional to the size of the entry. in the Treemap in & fsview; this goal is not always drawn to the disclosure of entries, and these frames require space, which is then lost to the subordinate entries. note that less space is lost for the frame, if the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">As the distribution of an entry for the subordinate entries will remain, the implementation will be overpriced. here it is for the label and to prevent the surfaces such as possible, which are possible to square, which are possible to square. the best methods are shown in lines, columns or receptive parent.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can set the minimal presented area for an entry in the menu entry to the area. instead, a catching pattern is drawn into the area of the above entry, to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an orderly entry.</seg>

<seg id="56">& digiplug, contains a fast image processing with basic processing tools. you can use these to view your photos, comment to evaluate and correct. the processing capabilities can be easily expanded with KDE Image plugins Interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & digiplug is; easy to use, it is complete cleaning professional abilities. it works completely in 16-bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion by libraw, DNG-export and ICC-color-administered workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with much more metadata as well as & eg; on the camera or the lens can be sought.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kart; programs is also & digiplug; an open source project. that means, it is focused on support of the Endanwender. they should therefore report problems and improvement possibilities.</seg>

<seg id="62">You can also take the digiplug; homepage to see News about free-released versions and other information about & digiplug; to find out.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to participate in & digiplug, is the registration in the developer mailinglist. guide to sign up in the developers mailinglist from & digiplug;.</seg>
<seg id="64">If you come & digiplug; for the first time, you will be asked where you want to save your pictures and your database. enter the file name here or click the folder icon file to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field you have to specify a local folder on your computer. here, data abnk will be stored. this path remains the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add so many folders as you want to add. & digiplug, you will additionally use as Albenlibrary. add settings and digious collections</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard disk, you can specify the top file that contains images as base folder. & digiplug, viewed any sub-folder as album. no image will be changed. during the search of the folder you get a progress indicator as this:</seg>
<seg id="68">& digiplug; duryages relegsive the library fad in its whole depth. you can't let any sub-folder, unless it is in a hidden folder. this allows you to take an insombs & digiplug, do by making a point in front of the name of the folder.</seg>

<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are designed to be transmitted via the use of Compact & Flash; memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. the camera will then be realized as a record engine. the camera can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras use the connection to serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& digiplug, uses the program gPhoto2 to communication with digital cameras, which has been developed an increasing number of more than 800 cameras. gPhoto2 also supports the transfer protocol designed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to machines and other peripherals without the need additional driver.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the calculator. since photos in general large files are slow and transmission via the serial port, this connection is meanwhile outdated. & digiplug, supports these cameras and leads the transmission of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgno 2 has to be created with libexif support, so that the EXIF support will not be read from some libcomplex 2 camera channels. if the EXIF support is not available in libgowns 2, you will be able to show anything larger or the production could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things in & digiplug, is how easy to expand its functionality by modules:</seg>

<seg id="151">Perhaps you will be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can be found quickly over your location. the remaining photos will be arranged on the same place. if you have enough photos, then you will use sub-folders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc. you can then print a folder for images that you print or on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements such as versioning photos, archiving, working process, constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of images. within 10 years 95% archives and 5% work files and you will not want to reorganise your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes the pile processing easier. separate new of old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and workfiles simplifies the backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are searching for an original or an derived image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the metadata to store the metadata at the time of the metadata in & digiplug. if you forget that Exif- and IPTC data can be written into the file, then you can easily save the metadata from the database into the files by clicking the corresponding item in the menu album.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change what you want? to give them a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are the main features of course.</seg>
<seg id="157">Well, the real work begins, since you should now choose all images that you want to select every photo. of course you can choose all photos that the same attribute need to select and then set the value. this makes sense, since you can concentrate on the best photos in further work.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let's go to us with keywords, keywords, as you are often called with other programs, or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you want to import catalogized pictures from another source with embedded locations, then it will build the tree for you or put the images on the right spot. the changes of the hierarchy is no problem and can simply be done by removing a sub-tree to another. the changed keywords will be pursued by & digiplug; updated while the sub-trees are persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata is cut out. this is a very rough representation, since each block of metadata in truth consists of many sections. filenames and calendar data are properties of all pictures.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to labels or comments, the third major tool to catalogate your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">They want to see most of your photos simply only, they want to share them with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. they are sure to be interested in your photos.</seg>
<seg id="163">Check out this panorama. from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you consider closer look, then catch some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I tell you this the landing area of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandie 60 years after landing. Wow! one starts to dream, associations, the historical period is again present, you may perhaps even hear the silence. the label has changed your perception of this panorama.</seg>
<seg id="165">For other photos consider the title may be more important than the image itself to create a story. remember that the key is to help you to transfer it to Him as the motive has the opportunity to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is okay if a picture is not perfect when it has the strength only with a label for himself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digiplug, you can also save a lot of text, in an internationalised alphabet (UTF-8), then you can use it for a selection of images at the same time. KDE will also give you a spelling tests according to your wishes into the label and / or the title of the web gallery system. you have to tell the story therefore for a second time.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times before GPS? when you had to find in another city without navigation system? was it not a boring planet before google Earth? well, because with images the train of the spatial presentation now has been running now with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities can increase the geolocalization. I'm sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually repeat the photos at the reception place. you can also read the photos at the reception place. you can also find the photos at the reception place. you can also export the images to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc. using Google Earth viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and signifies the practice of copyrights to remove limitations across the distribution and change of copies. the same freedoms are also applicable in all changed versions, so also for working other.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description will tell you what information in the setup site of & digiplug is:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for replacement and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the photographer, for example to use the name of the photographer, then the name of a company or organisation will not be changed. after that of this value, it should not be changed, but this field does not support Semikolons as a separator.</seg>
<seg id="173">Autositel (synonymous with author): associated with the author. this field contains the working name of the photographer. examples may be the title like: employee photographer, Free photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a note to the author field, this must be filled out too.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for providers): use the view box to identify who is the photo. if the photographer has been listed here, you can't necessarily plan the image. if the picture is a stock photo, then the group / agency will then offer the image here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although they have no protection against abuse. everyone who has no protection against abuse. this is the solution for this problem is digital watermark. for individuals, this is only very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique in the picture. & digiplug, in the near future, a module for stacker processing is available.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: record-release mistake, power failure, ECC, transmission error, aging of storage media, restoration, redundancy, desasterness, lifetime, temperature, data size, widespread superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we're not talking about CDs that went on the road or a fire. these kind of losses are the same which can also happen with traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section it concerns problems with the so-called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll Ontrack, the largest data recovery company in the world, has some interesting statistics which has a loss of data.</seg>
<seg id="180">To fight the problem with CDs / DVDs, these must be treated for longer than a few years. of course, you can also keep your CDs and DVDs in archive quality, of course you can claim even more expensive and much more expensive. there are offers of gold coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 that can claim a lifetime of 100 years for themselves. if you believe that is in your narrowning game.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD Disks can be unreadable but you can use this risk in which you can use good disco and good recording equipment. the best DVD recording devices are not more expensive than the cheapest, but you're writing a lot more reliable. therefore it turns out to the right.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very vulnerable for errors, even if you are just written only. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and control sums. despite this massive protection, they use chemical antiquities, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc.</seg>
<seg id="183">For faulty CDs and DVDs, there is a reasonable program called IsoBuster. it runs under Windows and & Linux, but is still not available for Macs. there's also similar applications the damaged data of damaged disks, hard disks, Flash media, USB drive etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray Disks seem to save the format War against the HD DVD. a Dual-layer Blu-ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a Dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB. everything which has been spoken to CDs and DVDs is of course also for the Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good recording device to high-quality media in a non-proprietary format. also read the media with a description, date & author label and afterwards protected on a clean, dark dry and before animals protected site. do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before using the last piece of hardware or software that can read this media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Diskmanufacturer keep your statistics for themselves. their manufacturer guarantees a new disk, but not the data. Google presents a large field study about the error mechanisms of hard drives: dismissiles</seg>
<seg id="187">Shortly: Disks will keep on the longest when you are operated in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. The most common error reading, SMART can not determine the impending failure. some of the SMART cannot be impending. these are particularly readers of reading and publishing counter. the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete losses due to overvoltage. of course you can also have data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files, but these losses may normally produce without large problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical devices do not have a lot of power, this can take heavy damage with computer chips and high speed processes. these can cause severe damage, complete data loss, hardboard motherboards, and other defects. protect themselves from inevitable, causing it to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">Most common protection against electricity peaks is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs a part of energy heat absorbs and the rest. it is usually possible in the form of a plug-wall. remember that not any plug-line also contains an overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, then you should make sure that he meets the UL 1449 standard. it guarantees a certain minimum to protection. you should also make sure that it protects against lightning bolt and thus protects the correctly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">As a overvoltage can use each cable to your computer, you should also make sure that all the peripherals can be connected to your system. some manufacturers provide overvoltage support which also includes a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connectivity options for coaxial cable of the cable modems and the TV ticket.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, then you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these tools are specially developed for notebooks and therefore also contain protection for the modem. so you are ideal for travelling.</seg>
<seg id="194">While the overvoltage protection your system protects your system from smaller variations in the power lines it will not really help you. even a few seconds can lead to the loss of unsubstitable data. therefore, it may be meaningful to invest in an uninterruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protect against overlashings, these devices can automatically be able to save your data. however, some models allow you to save your data. if you want a UPS, then you should be sure to keep the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the included software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk to prevent your computer system and compare its security in current problems with the cost of avoiding these. a high-quality overvoltage protection can be used for less than & euro; 40. this is just a small price difference if you think. at the end you should always remember all cables to trenne before you go into the holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - an easy storage service. using the right configuration you can use this as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to store this as a backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offer that you can save any quantities of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">However, they are very expensive compared to the hard drives at home very expensive - 40 GB costs & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB costs & dollar; 500. furthermore, you have to send the data about the comparatively slow Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">Solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against local data loss of the most important images. it does not include a poor solution, but there is no general backup solution. it is therefore too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are available on photos. the professional variant will not provide you with full resolution online. for 25 $per year you get unlimited storage what should be reviewed in reality.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of the data backup, web solutions are very secure. transmission errors are automatically included with the TCP protocol and the large companies are included in the offer as a backup and secure memory.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer. all transmissions are due for transmission errors. the file system requirements and btrfs provide at least the data integrity between operating systems and hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that no one says when a transmission error occurred, not when it was done in your hardware. it is pretty worrying that there should be no protection in your computer. no one seems to have thought about it. the internet with its TCP protocol is a more safe data way than the in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power parts are another source of transfer losses, as they generate interferences within the data flow. under normal file system these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are currently not affected by transfers problems, you should see in the future. already 2010 you will see thousands of error per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS by Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle and highly scalable and is available. it is open source, with many patents and is available under one to the GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it will soon be available for Linux and Windows. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has started its own initiative with its btrfs filesystem. it is still in alpha-status. it uses the same protection mechanisms the zfs and is also available for & Linux; but it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate that these two factors are responsible for 86% of the data losses in notebook and 46% with the job systems. if notebooks, the proportion of theft is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less widespread than the most memory. it leads to a lower damage, than for theft or new installations. and there is currently only a few viruses and under & Linux; so long no longer sighted.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less susceptible to data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS in order to give the common file systems. a very good English article will be found here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process with sudden interruption during an operation is higher and an undefined status is avoided. if a file does not have been added before the problem is lost, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat for digital data: false, theft and human error are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings from fundamental physical limits. genert is that while the technology is further developed, there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and roughkcharacteristic for all kinds of light sensors are no longer removed from this border.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards the 10 megapixels sensors. even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the final result is the optimum for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolutions, you need a full format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard disk drive you today for 100 & euro; so do not make another data loss for data loss. thus, you can secure your data often after a plan and test this backup before you do anything like the new installation of your operating system, the exchange of panels or the size change of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your backups on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, lightning strikes you, if the drive was not connected in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster proposes locally and destroyed a lot. forget an aircraft accident: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous enough for your data. they usually affect an entire room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Hence, Desasterprevention is always a non-local storage. bring your backups to the neighbourhood, in your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as above mentioned is a more common reason for a data loss despite backup the panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files should be secured. it is a snapshot without historians and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differentiation backup: a backup of the files have been changed since the last complete backup. generates a complete momentum of two time points: the complete backup and the last differentiation.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: ensuring a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. it can produce the original status of any time. this securing comes to a versioning system next with the exception that it is only abated and not continuing.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful small tool that can easily setup easily on your machines. in contrast to script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transmissions. this happens compressed, and if you want to increase safety over ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Secure an important pictures directly after you have saved them on your computer on a DVD or another optically medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach can give you enough time to discover and restore losses. at the same time, you get a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly momentary for at least one month and a moment of momentary for each month. any further expansion should be manually after you have taken a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, stored in the image file stored IPTC information, associated XMP files, original retain, memory, scalability, media, relocate images and metadata, copy the pictures to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visual equipment,...</seg>
<seg id="227">Thus valuable images will survive the next 40 year that is about the time that you are really interested in your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future is unforeseeable, you need to consider everything today. unfortunately, there is no other way to keep your watch over time. every 5-8 years you should ask yourself as the current system backwards compatible. if you have less variations in the past, all easier is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered with explanations in this document, so do you use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization today is now available for everyone. if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures, then store it up and install it in a virtual machine for a later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the Council is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your memory and Secure technology, or your file format, should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard. stay open-open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the expert pressure for the possibility to change a system in its size. it actually means to enlarge.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let us assume that you have completed the scalability with the set and the area you want to have a dedicated record or partition. with * nix systems such as & Linux; you can copy this area and select the new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check the command dmesg if your new record has been detected, but do not hang them up.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollar; dd if = / dev / SDC # source is / dev / sdc1 0 & sdc1 0 & lt; size of the plate in MBER; # works with ext2,3, FAT16, 32 and ReiserFS & dollar; resize2fs / dev / corc1 # change the size of ReiserFS if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day there is no software more that can read it, then you can create this task. this task is easier by year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary format that disappears slowly from the market. it should therefore no longer be used.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG was to replace the GIF as an open source standard, but it can save much more. it's lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC Metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. PNG is that there is relative many administration information, but not as many as TIFF needed and recommend a slow compression. this format we would like to recommend you to save your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as image format. it manages images in high quality, but requires very large files. with some cameras you can easily save your pictures in this format. however, there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The digital negatives file format is a licensed and open raw file format developed by Adobe Systems. it is based on the amount of camera formats. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is required to use metadata. a handful Cameroy manufacturer is now available and we hope to use the competitors from Canon and Nikon.</seg>
<seg id="241">This may be one of the reasons why, in 2001, Adobe its XML-based XMP technology introduced to replace the & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a characteristic technology that allows users to create & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers attract it before the original of your photo, mostly in raw format, to view it. XMP fits them to problems with the link between the metadatendatei and the image file, and so you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and place everything there.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization that support for fully compatible Online metadata standards. to the activities of DCMI, the work on architecture and modelling activities, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and transmitting efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images of the camera, the card reader or the scanner. so long the pictures are on the camera's camera you can use it as temporary fuse.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your blanket. this function is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a sensitive work you can use external programs. if you come back with & digiplug, then you should add the metadata again. these were cut under circumstances from other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the produced images for the copyright with a digital watermark. export them only in Webgaleries, code to MPEG, use in contact page, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digiplug. in the section add a photos to an album, you can add photos that you already have already on your hard drive, but the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for importing images to your album bank.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digiplug, connect this with the computer, switching the camera to the display mode and switch it on. another description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, try to connect to your camera. if the connection is made, a distance indicator at the bottom ends and the images of all photos on the camera will be displayed. some cameras do not represent such images. if this is the case, the filenames and a symbol of file rules for each file, photos, movies, music etc.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you can download the photos on your computer, you might need the camera information about any entry. using the sidebars properties and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the characteristics of an entry or a metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog displays file characteristics and the photo information that can be stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded on your computer. note that some digital cameras are not available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The rider Metadata shows the internal metadata as EXIF, manufacturer note, GPS etc. of the image. these information are the same as in the metadata page from the main window of & digiplug; or the imaging. note that these metadata are not available on some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button Download and then download the photos from their camera into a single album in & digiplug, and we recommend you to check if the pictures have been downloaded in a album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you don't want to download all photos, you can only select the desired option from & kde; when you selected the photos, use the button. download the button Selected, until you selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this is a new option. these pictures have been released until now not from & digiplug. in this case, the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window. if you select this option, of course the new pictures will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you can download or download the buttons, you will find a dialog where you can select the target album, displayed in the photos. the list of existing albums are sorted according to normal folders. select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After which you have selected the target album, press OK, and & digiplug, the photos from the camera takes you into the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all at once, by using the button delete all. if you want to delete a button, then you need to select this first and remove from the Delete Line.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no possibility to recover photos that have been deleted from the camera. you should not check out whether the photos were successfully deleted from the camera. if you want to delete the camera, you should make sure that you want to make this camera by camera, as it is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as filenames often not especially meaningful names. the filenames are usually used again after having taken photos of the camera. this can be sensible, the date and time to integrate the picture, in which the image has been made to integrate into the filename.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for turning and mirrors of the image and for data-based subverbs. if you use this latter option, you will automatically create a folder a day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transfer opens three further options, which are done before the photos are stored on the disk. if you select this, the corresponding entries will be copied from the EXIF information into the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct the date and time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you wish another date format than the default format, you can use the prefix photo -% Y-% m-% d% H:% S. turn this option to add date and time. for further adaptations, you should read the help of the command.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the camera file names, you have the option to change the file names in small case letters or if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, the & digiplug; for a photo, is displayed beneath the name, showing the camera in preview. their settings are stored and automatically used when you open the next time for the next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digiplug, you can use all information about the orientation of the camera to perform an automatic rotation during shutdown. not all cameras make this information. in the section sidebar Metadata, you can read more details about the information that your camera embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">Automatic rotation is usually switched on, and when your camera is not supplied, and digiplug, the photo in the original orientation. if you want to switch off automatic rotation, use the button extension and select the Automatic rotation in the lower range of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera has been made on the picture, in which the photo was made, you can use & digiplug. all the images with the same date are loaded into the same subalbum. not all cameras make this information available. in Section sidebar Meta Data, you can consult the photos embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is normally switched off, and in this case, & digiplug, the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this option, you will need to switch this option, and select the option file-based sub-based sub-based subfolders at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to download photos from their computer to your camera is the button. then choose the file selection dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files that are uploaded. you can also select more than a file with the Standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, asks & digiplug, where the images will be loaded up. choose a folder selection dialog for the camera. choose the desired folder and press OK to start the upload file. the images are not deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general concept that is specified in length and latitude, which can be displayed on a map. the identification of data can be performed by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers it can make it interesting a picture with a precise geographic site. not everyone uses a plane to sing an area through automatic recording of GPS data. environmental planner, military, police, architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you forgot exactly the photo, you can open a browser that shows the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & digiplug, users want to document the place of the photos, or just to document this aspect, it is good to transmit the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how to get the GPS data into the image? first, you should know that exiv2 does not support many GPS data fields, such as the data in these fields? there are at least three ways to reach this. right with the right hardware, via an editing of GPS data and image files with the KIPI module to the geographical mapping (manual) and last about the manual input of well known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there are currently no camera which has a GPS unit. but there is a few that work with GPS receivers. either as map module or transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>

<seg id="297">With the adjustment of PNG compression, you can't reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not need the image quality, since PNG is a reliable algorithm. if you have a fast calculator, you can set this value to a high compression. that means 1: a low and 9 high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the add-to-files you can switch the deflate algorithm for TIFF pictures. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it does not affect the image quality because the deflate algorithm has no loss.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the adjustment of loss free JPEG 2000 files you can save loss free. even if you have written the loss of loss, the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than in the normal JPEG. when this paragraph was written, Metadata was not yet supported, but was in planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & digiplug, the picture processing was just a viewer for photos. currently, it develops very fast to a tool for manipulating your photos. with this dialog, you can change the settings of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The standard deviation is that all green pixels are equal to ultraviolet light. if you use this option to ultraviolet light, this option shows a bit soft, eliminates the 2x2 ring patterns with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white equal to the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the Automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is used only if the white equal is not set. standard is it a fixed color balance, which was photographed on a white card which was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. the use of the second sensors has the effect that exposed images in four steps more details in the top. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the top light, so the parts of your images are the top-to-view, because of the ability of your camera to view the top white in the settings. the setting colors are generated by some unusual results as they show the top-light in various Rosatönen. lastly, you can try to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the top-lights.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general is not so fast as fast as green and red. & dcw try therefore to reconstruct the missing green and red-shares from the still not saturated blue pixels. of course this is a question, how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the option, select the option to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and can thus be adjusted individually for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the Luminous value according to your taste. you probably have to set him a bit higher than the default 1. this may also be made later in the educational options of the & digiplug, in order to keep the time for Demosatone small, you should be conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A demo process is a digital imprint process, in order to calculate a complete picture from the partial raw data that have many cameras and of a matrix color pixel. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or color reconstruction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digiplug; and Dcraw will present you three alternatives: Bilinear, VNG-Interpolation (variable number of gradient) it was the first algorithm created by Dcraw. it creates source text file on edges. Bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with acceptable results.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color feed of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for a softening correction, since it is done during the raw conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions as these again should be given. there are also LCMS and & digiplug, information such as the color information of a colour space in the others to translate the colors as exactly as possible.</seg>

<seg id="315">Settings of the ICC profiles have here the possibility & quot; standard squot; for your profile to deposit. everything can be changed when opening the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color-management view is an alternative compared to Xcalib or Arganda. only your images are not managed by the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should be able to use the camera manufacturers and model. there are some, such as Canon, that contain no color mapping or gammaize. currently, dcw Gamma is not corrected for conversions at 16 bit depth. this means that you need to perform the color mapping yourself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options like the Soft Proof-Profile, which you can emulate as your image from one device again. this is very useful before you can print a smaller color range when your printer may work as your camera and some colors, so you could manually correct instead of the flash algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras, it is quite evident that color profile is intended for them. unfortunately, not in the models of Canon. therefore, here is a table of cameras and profiles fit together. this answer is naturally unofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon Line extension leaves the style for the purpose: F for a precise style, L for landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portrait and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; image plug-in interface. it is an interface that can support from a series of & kde; image viewing and image processing is supported; many modules support which have been written to work with each program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has the KIPI modules installed, you will see a list of available modules. choose which you want to use and these will be loaded by & digiplug; loaded. these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and beyond. you will find some also in the context menu of the preview window.</seg>
<seg id="323">Initial commands for tasks that are carried out by modules can be fixed in the menu under settings of short commands.</seg>
<seg id="324">For more information (in English) via KIPI modules you can get via the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or via the KIPI modules.</seg>

<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in simple text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digiplug, you will find further information about this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digiplug, contains a fast image processing with some basic tools. you can use them to view your photos and to improve and improvement. the picture processing can be started by a click with the left mouse button on the preview of a picture or by the context menu of the preview and selection of the updated ad / editing.</seg>
<seg id="338">The picture processing contains a number of tools to improve your pictures. some of them are available as modules in & digiplug. so, they are not part of your distribution. more information about the KIPI modules can be found in the picture processing.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the lower edge of the window, filename, current record number, magnification factor and current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top edge and including the tool bar for quick access to the most common functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The processing functions of the imaging change your photos. however, no functions will change the original photo, before you can save the Save or button Save from the tool bar. note that you can't restore the original photo, once you have saved the picture.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you might make a copy of your image before you change it. you can Save to Save as file.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can use the original image again by using the menu File Recovery or button Der Knopf Reproduce the Edit Recover in the toolbar. they lose any change that you have carried out in the photo since the last store.</seg>
<seg id="344">Virtually any action of the imaging can be remodelled or re-produced. the last promotion can be remodelled by changing editing, or re-produced by converting processing from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you're often using this, you should replace the shortest, Ctrl; -z on the back and ctrl; -Umschalt-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you select the & LMB; via the rear or restore button in the tool bar, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all the actions are reproduced or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you started the image processing, you can move between the photos in the same album or same keyword by using the navigation button in the toolbar, image below or the entries in the menu file. if you have changed changes to the current photo, you will be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can put in the photo in the photo, in which you can use Ctrl; Mausoleum or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the box menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adapt a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the tool bar: magnification factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen Mode photo shows the photo in full screen mode. if you don't want to use the Esc button. if you don't want to change this, you can call this in the dialog dialog of & digiplug. you can view this from the & digiplug. see this section for setting up the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can select image printing in the menu image and get the default & kde; print dialog. you can customize settings before using your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print individual images or full movements. all images can choose from your selection. you only need to select the images with the standard methods and select from the menu album Export printer assistance. if you follow the assistant, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The digiplug comes; main window has a sidebar at right edge, which provides important information and actions for the selected pictures. the same sidebar is available without the navigation components, even in the image processing. it is displayed if one of the five riders is attached:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple clicking on the same rider can appear the sidebar or disappear again in the edge.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the labelling view, you can enter or insert the note down. the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed to enter the EXIF- and IPTC- Felder, so that you can use other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are cut and special characters are formed after 2000 characters. if you want to use the IPTC labelling box in other applications, you should consider this restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After having commented it, use either the button user or change to the next image, which will then be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">In addition to the user-button there is a button More. with this, you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database. however, this will always be carried out when you select a metadata setting that is always written into the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The section evaluates a value fema of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorter. it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or with the keyboard abbreviation Ctrl + 0... 5. in order to evaluate several pictures simultaneously, select this from and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation will be written in the IPTC field. the coding follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword shows a search box for filtering the keywords, the keyword tree and a selection box with the previously in this & digiplug; -Session applied keywords.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree will be adapted dynamically to the entered search phrase. you can restrict the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword. this ability is especially useful if you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the lower end is a further relief for the input of keywords in a photo series. if you have entered several words, these are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be placed by selecting the corresponding check boxes in the tree. all tags of a picture are stored in the IPTC field Keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If several pictures are chosen in the main screen and select a keyword in the keyword tree, this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection, if you want a selection with a keyword, please read the keyword filter.</seg>
<seg id="366">The sidebar keyword filter is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window. normally, the left sidebar will be used with their album, - filen-, keyword and search filters. if in addition one or several keyword filter will be used, only the cut-quantity of these two are displayed. all created words are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also draw and retrieve. suppose you have chosen several pictures in the main screen. if the keyword already exists, you can simply drag it from the right sidebar and set it onto the selection. as a dialog you will ask if you want to translate the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example shows the pictures on a calendar day. the keyword filter is reduced to a few words. they were selected with Ctrl + a, and then a keyword from the right-keyword tree were drawn up and put there. a dialog asks whether this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes occurs in every start of the program. you can also be switched on settings different.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and establish it, you can easily change it with a double-click on the text and control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry, after which in the database is sought. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3) The argument for the operator, which is a name or a string, which is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">You can define a wide search for all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to grouped options, you only need the check box at the end of the rule and then click the button grouping. the options are as follows:</seg>

<seg id="377">The reason why one's color-managed workflow is a predictable deviation from the actually used or missing colors. using a colourless workflow, you can reach the colors on your monitor or scanners like the same and the colours that correspond to them from your digital dark chamber.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the theme appears on color administration, then everyone wants to express what buttons he needs to provide adequate decisions regarding each point of image processing workflows. in addition, these tutorials will make you adequate background information about color administration. additionally, you should make your own informationdecisions to make your own informationdecisions to make your desired results.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflows shall be fulfilled every six below, then you do not need to worry about colour management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor that is calibrated on the RGB colour space. (more information see below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Its only other educational expenditure include email or the web where sRGB at de-facto standard is.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and life for all so easy, why should we use another colour space and make thoughts about color png ng?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the limitation of sRGB compared to the colors we really can see below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the hufeisenular region, and the colors in the RGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB using some larger farms, visit Bruce Lindblooms page and then click on info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to test my monitor at my monitor when I decided to work in the sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! if you are working in the RGB color space or do not, you need to make your monitor kallized, since the RGB of your monitor is simply simply the circle. if you simply use your monitor to the RGB standard, you need to use either your monitor to the RGB-standard kallis, an appropriate monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections which can improve a picture in most cases. use it as they try to try a further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions Normalizing, abated, Automatic abnormality and contrast expands from the menu, automatically try to experiment the best. they are to experiment with these effects, to see what works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaled the Leuststronger values above the entire picture, so that the darkest point is black and the brightest point as bright as possible. this function is often an gastric correction for pictures that are dark or balanced.</seg>
<seg id="391">Compare: this method covers the luminosity of the colours of the selected image so that the histogram of intensity is as flat as possible. sometimes, the same very good results in the improvement of the contrast of a picture, sometimes produces only rubbish. it concerns a very powerful surgery that causes either miracles in an image or destroyed it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic adjustment: this method maximizes color, green and blue canal. it determines the dark and bright boundaries and adjusted the red, green and blue channels on the entire histogrammons.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contracted: this method improves the contrast and the luminosity of RGB values of a picture through the lowest and highest values of all values between. this is only visible when balanced pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white sign of & digiplug comes; is a semi-automated tool to do the white equal to one photos.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white-equal correction is something limited because of a color space with 8-bit per color. if you are able to perform areas with overexposure. if you can perform the white equal in the shell mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities will expire to correction better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm of the copyright of Pawel T. Jochym. you start the menu entry colors white equal to the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left side are adapted to the original image as well as the preview of the target image. the preview will be dynamically adapted to the settings of the tool. if you like to see the original whip, then it is enough to click the bottom window.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red marker. the luminance of the Pixels under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">On the right above, a histogram is displayed as soon as you have changed a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in good illuminated images, most of the pixels very small Luminous values. with one button you can choose whether one of the three colors or your sum will be indicated. the sum will be Luminous.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadows, saturation and Gamma. the shadows is adjustable and down the shadow details of your photos or down.</seg>
<seg id="401">With the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press the colour temperature pipette. press on this knob and then to use the selected color for calculating the color temperature of the white strain. on this type, the temperature and green values are automatically set.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white equal with the list of default settings. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicators increases the colors when more than one color channel of the Pixels is displayed. this will be shown in preview as a pure indicator and does not have any effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">Buttons Save as and shop make exactly this. any setting of the white equal set you can use this in a text file and then load it later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The button preferences sets all filter values again on their standard values and the corresponding neutral white flue. note that even neutral settings will be put another photo as your original. if you want to save your original image.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set the coaxial antenna per color channel of the machined image. 8-bit encoding is better suitable for high-quality images. this coding is also better for high quality images. this coding requires even more disk space, calculator and stands only for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialogue as to the processing of raw profiles. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color mapping can be done by the subwindow for the use of color profiles. a detailed instructions for use of color profiling allows you to rate the chapter colour management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu under the colors of clay correction. this tool provides an integrated way to store multiple color channels simultaneously and allow you to use them for several photos. this is helpful if your camera or your scanner will always make the same mistakes and you can always find the same correction. in the manual for the pitch correction, you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool to gradation that you find under colors Gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digiplug; tool colour effects will give you four colour effects, a solar control effect, a Velvia filter, a neon-effect and a cantenant filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of the chemical processing, Solarisation, also called Sabatier, was a effect of the additional light. this had the effect that the brighter areas darker and the colours were inverted by the second lighting. the result was a partial negatively of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls solar power. at approx. 50% intensity shows the picture which is chemically possible. another increase is generated, a negative figure that is not possible to generate photopapier.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar effect. the original is the (1) and it processes (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid-filters simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; it differs from a saturation that he has a stronger contrast effect which makes the colors brilliant and smooth. try it easy, it embellished many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an daylight optimized colour film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. Velvia offers very saturated color in daylight and high contrasts. the characteristics make him a film of choice for natural photography. Velvias strongly contains saturated colors, but also some photographers, especially of which the scarce scenery, too much.</seg>
<seg id="416">The Neonfilter simulates Neon onlight on the contradiedges. the parameter level controls the magnitude of the results and the shooting repetitions the thickness of Neonlight. in large pictures the filter enables the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusually that you want to correct the color mixing and the luminosity of the photos. all your opinions can be viewed in preview. once you are satisfied with the result, use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo of bad light conditions, you can get a good choice for brightness / saturation. also in this case, it is the tool for brightness / saturation instead of increasing. all the changes you can perform in preview. if the result is the result, you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool Gradation and the simple leuchstarch / contrast / Gamma is the tool key correction to improve the exposure. even if the dialog for this tool is very complicated, you need only the use of the shooting. concrete the three sliding below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graphs of intensity values, an histogram, active channel or the selected area. under the graph, three sliders can be clicked and postponed to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side of the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The simplest way to learn the control is to postpone the knob and keep on it how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right hand, the original and preview of the Image can be viewed. preview is dynamically, based on the settings of the picture, updated. on the left, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: this selection box can be adjusted if the histogram with linear or logarithmic Y axis is displayed. for images of a digital camera, the linear histogram is dominated by a single pillar. in this case, the logarithmic entry is useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three knob: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the medium tones, commonly known gammavalues.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color pin paces can be used in preview of the original image, in order to adjust the input values of the shade, medium and bright tones automatically. in addition there is a button for fully automatic alignment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow manual values for each area. there are also two knob the output values can be used in order to evaluate the output values. for example, compression values can be used as background images as background, while something else in the foreground can be seen.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button, the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and loading: these buttons can be stored in the file system and later reloaded. the Gimp levels format will be used.</seg>
<seg id="429">When you use this mode and use the three color paces, the input values automatically adjust for all shade, funds and sun tones. activate the color pette that you want to use and click on the preview of the original program for rotational, green, blue and luminosity.</seg>
<seg id="430">The option overexposed images control all color channels to display overexposed pixels and indicate you the combined result of all channels. this means that the effect can only be shown in preview and no effect can be seen in the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below is an example of the alignment of input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photos. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original picture is marked with (1) and correct image with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left hand, half of the original and the target image will be displayed. the preview can be updated dynamically depending on your settings. on the right side the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifications channel: this selection box allows the channel to specify the channel:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this cage, two symbols are used to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for images which have been recorded using a digital camera. for images with large areas of constant colour, linear mode generates a wide beam. in this case, the logarithmic mode helps.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move to the right, e.g. the bright tones, then you can see that these bright tones are correspondent with darker output and the corresponding pixel of pixel are darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos is a red markings to see. if you want to change this sign to the area you want to move, the matching line shows the original value. create a point on this line and move it off and off until the value is adjusted according to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and charging: with these buttons, you can do exactly this. each curve that generated you can be stored in the file system and later loaded. the file format for this is the Gimp curvy format.</seg>
<seg id="438">When you create this method and the three color pipaces buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of the shadow, medium and sun tones. activate the color pette that you want and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and Luminous curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The option overexposed images control all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than a channel overexposed pixels, you get a indicator, that means you get the effect just in preview and no effect can be seen in the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-and-white photo, which was set in Luminous channel. shadow and sunshades was applied with the colour pipette and applied to the curves. the original is (1) and correct (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer of the & digiplug; image processing is a tool to improve the colour channels or change the shade of color photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the color shades of the images. you can edit it from the menu colors Channel Mixer from the Image Processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box, you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first hint as you can correct the relative distribution and rash. the left area of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed as comparison of your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you positioning this image, a vertical line will appear in the histogram with you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are right below: knob for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels even if you are also able to activate the respective color mixing, as the channel blender then is THE tool for generating great black-and-white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix monochrome, the reduction of a colour is in a visible smoke that comes from farbrauschen. if that is the case, you can improve your Monochrome conversion as a result in which you can reduce the farbrauschen.</seg>
<seg id="447">The Save as and loading buttons are used exactly to this purpose. any arbitrary mixer setting can thus save and then load. the used file format is the Gimp channel-mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The option overexposed images control all color channels to display overexposed pixels and indicate you the combined result of all channels. this means that the effect can only be shown in preview and no effect can be seen in the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in the blue canal. the Luminance option is activated. the original picture is under (1) and the working picture below (2) can be seen.</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a working step, because colour pictures can easily be converted to the computer. also with a set of film pockets.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford Pane Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filters: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lenticulate filter. this looks good, with all scenarios and fits especially well to portraits of the sky. similar to the 004 Cokin (TM) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange filters: simulates a black / white film exposure with a orange linear filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and aerial photos. similar to the 002 Cokin (TM) orchard.</seg>
<seg id="454">Rotfilter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red line filter. this creates dramatic skyeffects and can simulate lunatic life. so much like the 003 Cokin (TM) Rotfilter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filters: simulates a black / white film exposure with an yellow lens filters. this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similarly to 001 Cokin (TM) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: this is produced warm and medium tones throughout the shines. this is very similar to the process of flashing of a print and re-development in a septic converter. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similarly to the 005 Cokin (TM) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the & digiplug; tool texture allows you to apply decorative textures on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a colour screen or not, you can look like an oil painting on a canvas, the Stich of an old master, a pop-portrait of enlarged points or as a mural on a wall. the menu entry is used for image processing.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: shift this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three dimensional stability of the texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper texture rate is applied on the photo below. the original picture is (1) and that changed under (2). the relief was set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digiplug; tool frame can add a decorative frame to be added a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">To hold the eye of a viewer in the boundaries of a photos, no easy task. an opportunity to keep his attention is a decorative eye. this is a psychological barrier for scattering eye. under picture frame, the module can be started out of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter set you the desired cream type for your image. the picture with a colored line, niepce surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black-white pictures), distilled it with a nice three-dimensional setting, ideal for a buttonhole and decoratively adding a decorative frame with pattern.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: specifies the width of the frame in percent. the value range for the width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target image will be bigger than the original but the same aspect ratio is greater than the original but the same aspect ratio. this is important for the pressure of pictures, especially when using the tool.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this practical tool, you can easily add a formatted text in a picture at any place. this will also occur in several places when you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. just enter text direction, orientation, color from the color space and the character set with its features such as you need. the larger the picture, the bigger must be the character set. at the end, simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any setting that you have chosen for your text can be changed, until you have changed to the button "OK" after the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it can't be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digiplug, set templates, you can put on a template on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu image templates can be used in image processing can be used to create stencils on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the stencil there is no restrictions regarding the size and orientation. you need to add the PNG file format and you should add your template's size of template; just send an e-mail in English to the & digiplug; mailinglist digiarrived-users @ kde.org..</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you have to set your stencil folders with the button base folder in the dialog. select the folder where you will have the templates that you see the templates.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder for the stencils, a building view, which reflects the folder's structure of the template. the selection of a folder will be updated automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">Below are three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button enlarges the displayed image. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrinking: this button resized the lower picture. in order to apply the position of the mouse, in order to apply the template on the whole image, you must be reduced accordingly to the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the picture below the template. take the picture and place it on the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK when you want to use template on your picture. the image will then be adjusted automatically.</seg>
<seg id="479">Digiplug comes; presents three different tool for sharpening. each of you has preferences in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but creates, especially in dark fields, grained pictures.</seg>
<seg id="481">Unsharfe mask works on the contrast of the edges in order to cool a picture of sharpness. indeed, it's not a bit, it works rather psychovisual. you can use it for a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyright protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocus is probably the best of the three, since it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its use and has various parameters to adapt.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitised images need a correction of the sharpness. these elements are smaller than the dissolution to a common colour. this again leads to a common colour. the same phenomenon can be printed on paper. SLR cameras require usually more retrospectively as normal cameras for home users.</seg>
<seg id="484">With JPEG images often a camera has been applied to internal sharpening. in contrast, images in the shell format only have to be welded during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners apply a sharpening filter already during the image of the image. when you deactivate this, check out the control over your picture.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get usable results by sharpening a photograph with the sharpening work. this allows you to correct sharpening sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="487">However, they should be careful, since the results are not very natural: the sharpness increases the sharpness of the edges, but also amplified the noise. in general, it is necessary to correct editing a picture. you can find more information about the menu icon. below refocus, you will find further information and compare all techniques to sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution that characterize the image is much easier than to sharpen. use the tool to correct switch with the menu entry. use the preview window on the right side of the dialog box gives you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter unblurred is a very good tool to remove sliders from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original and preview can help the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values produce good results and should increase the effect. if you make the yield mask to be strong, smokers and the impression of grates will produce in the vicinity of sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius indicates how many pixels are affected on each side of an edge with the filters. high-resolution images allow larger radii. they should therefore show pictures best in its final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount is added to the percentage between the original and the selected image one of the original is added. this will set the strength of the sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="494">The swellworth is a break from the maximum RGB value and the difference between the difference. you can define a minimum difference this way with a soft change between the tones of the sharpen and therefore beautifull errors in faces, peeling and water surfaces are avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the unblurred filter. the original image is the (1) and the working picture (2). unblurred was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a swelling value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digiplug; tool refocus on a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyright protected deflection filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries an image to & quot; refocus on it. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filtering. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filtering. it is often achieved better results than unblurred. you can start it from the menu by calling colors refocus on image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular flow is much better than the Gauss's Fitting. the FIR Wiener Inverse has also been removed from the source pixeln, which is far from the original quellous pixels. the FIR Vienna Inverse Is even influenced in most cases even very strong by the remote pixels. the unwanted results are unwanted.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular faxes. it is the most important parameter for use this module. for most images, the default value should be 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your image is very unblurred should then be shown to Heiligenscha.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help Artefacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values at 1, & eg; 0,95 and 0,99. a high value for the correlation reduces the effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Rauschfilters: an increase in the space filter can help you to reduce artefacts. however, values are higher than 0.1 only rarely. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 becomes the image quality very bad. a bit value is 0.03. a high value will be even more sensitive.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauss's sharpness: this is the radius of Gauss's sharpness. in most cases, you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoyed artifacts, so you may also increase the correlation and / or the noise filters.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of transformation matrix. an increase of matrix size can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the circular sharpness or the Gauss's sharpness. note that the module is very slow when you choose large values for this parameter. in most cases you should choose a value in the range from 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The saving as and loading buttons will be used exactly to this purpose. any refocus parameters will be added to you later and can be loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all the trimming, color and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the image. the reason for this is that much surgeries changes did not immediately appear immediately, which later left unpleasant artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read images and compress images, & eg; when JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, unblurred produces better results as sharpening. this might be caused by blurred a larger neighborhood as sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically it needs to be blurred. even under optimal conditions it can never remove any effect of unsharpen. for the Viennese filters you can always show the result of the FIR Wiener Filters always at least as well as the MIR filters. the FIR filter filter is often better when machining small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below, you can see a comparison between the different filters, on a little unfocused picture:</seg>
<seg id="511">This picture has to be corrected. this picture has to be corrected using a analog camera. the unfocused outcome is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information about methods to sharpening pendicular in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English below this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The regulator is the unsharpen of the eclipse, in order to create a more natural Pupille.</seg>
<seg id="514">The color tinker offers an adapted color for the pupil. if you want to set blue eyes instead of dark, then you can set this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The mould error correction is one of the most developed tool in order to remove the desired arisfactory with an unprecedented level.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Intestalgorithm was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains several settings as a set of points to simplify the restoration. the default settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings, you can use the horsemen and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detailing p [0, 100]: this controls the conservation of details. a smaller value leads to a smooth glass of smoothing and details. a value of 0.9 should be used mainly homogenous regions of smooth and details. please note that no sharpening is necessary. please note that the details can always be subordinated.</seg>
<seg id="520">Direction dependency alpha [0,100]: a small value smooth evenly into all directions, while a value close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film grained or a CCD noise, we will produce a high value wroneous patterns. JPEG Artefakte will be best removed at a value close to 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smoothing [0, 500]: this set the maximum smoothing factor over alles. p then defines the relative smoothing. set this value matching the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects greater structures. the higher this value is needed, the more will be smoothed, since then it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh's Turbulence effect, it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm is going through. usually goes 1 or 2 here.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle distance da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if Alpha small is chosen, there should also be small. consider that small angle should be a long runtime. you should choose this value so sitable and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integrating distance width [0,1, 10]: integrated step width in pixels. you should set the value below 1 to avoid sub-pixel glassment and never exceed 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear Interpolation Use: this option can be obtained by selecting this option, but it doubles the runtime of this option, but it doubles the runtime. we therefore recommend it to allow him.</seg>
<seg id="527">Buttons Save as and store make exactly this. any setting of images error can be saved in a text file and later reloaded.</seg>
<seg id="528">Image error correction is comparatively very fast in work. but it can still last long and a high CPU load after moving. you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the knob.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how pictures can be removed with little artifacts. the module is used on a photo that was created in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you see there is an independent black artifact fact that caused by a bad film storage during the journey. the original picture is under (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digiplug; a noise reduction is a very powerful tool to decrease assets. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Peter rear.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts, e.g. from dust or hair on the lens, too. it can also be used to remove sensors from the camera or Moire.; - effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor batches of digital cameras, you can read this tutorial in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screen picture above shows a typical scene which was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grained noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following cases you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the subwindows of advanced settings can remain in default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. great values increase the time that the filter is needed per pixel and allows the image administered over the image and colour in it is smoothed and thus smaller errors.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controlled the sharpness of the pixel. this value sets the pixel pitch behind the filter to the front. if it is increased, you need to change the edges. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter picture details can't be preserved and smoked once again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controlled the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, the total noise cannot be removed or smokable. set him to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controlled the luminance frequency of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings may not influence the smoothing process by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerant of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings may not influence the smoothing process by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controlled the Gammatolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which typically are stronger than to increase. it also contaminated the shadow ranges.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controlled by phasenjittering damping. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius on variations of the luminance. if it is increased, the edges appear to be high, the noise and phasenjitter will occur at the edges. it can remove crackdown and is the recommended method for it.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and store: these buttons are used exactly. all parameters for noise reduction that you have set can be stored into the file system and later loaded.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example how strust your life can change. the original picture is marked with (1) and correct with (2). the noise reduction was applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crisp for your purpose. fortunately, the image is much easier to draw with the menu entry. use tool to correct switch with the menu entry. the preview window is shown on the right side of the dialog box shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digiplug; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photographs acts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of unwanted arteas from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove palms, craters, compressive pictures, scratches, compression technology and local errors inside the contours and thus receives the contents as it also makes the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for colour and texturing. the text creation is developed with a different tool, the error correction was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / Frannbs and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artefacts: the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away. as a deserted compression algorithm created he creates some compression & quot; - small standards that are shown in uncompressed image. this setting should correct the problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">Buttons Save as and store make exactly this. any setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and later reloaded.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast in the job. but it can still last long and a high CPU load after moving. you can therefore stop the calculation at any time with the button finish.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can minimise like a photo with a shaped noise. the module is applied to a black and white photo that with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO (TM) HP-5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can recognize the infamous film grained on the faces. the original picture is below (1) and correct under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time Textures can minimize on an old color photograph taken with a scanner. you can see the scan species from the scanner lighting and the photo paper. the original picture is below (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digiplug; tool Hotpixel allowed it hotpixel by photos those with a CCD camera, eight were removed too. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project which are protected by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are particularly in high quality raw mode photos a problem as many cameras with JPEG compression can have a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixel quot; and "quot; luminous pixquot; on a photo with a dark image subtraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the button darkening. the tool automatically detect the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the picture preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important that you can pick up the dark picture directly in the connection to discover new hot or light pixel by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should download the matching dark image to the correct image. notice that the assistant will notice the last dark image and automatically loads this in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image and preview can help you correct within the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings. poor pixels are lifted in all areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area around the defective pixels on the preview and check the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the available filter:</seg>
<seg id="561">Thirst: an average of the neighbors is determined. the resulting colour is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is made separately for horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are moved to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are moved to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Kubisch: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less will be moved to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the broken pixel in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below, you can see the hotpixel correction on a colour photo taken from a faulty digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and a long exposure. the original picture has been increased to 300% (1) and the corrected picture is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The digiplug comes; Vignettification correction is a tool to correct the Vignetting, i.e. exposed corners, one image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lens, especially those in the middle and large photo format, can not equally illuminate the entire sensor range. instead & quot; vignetting quot; (shaded) it reaches the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light to reach the sensor there. teleobjective also show these characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="568">But it also has disadvantages. many Center filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 at the aperture filter, which should not be impossible to keep the camera with hand. wide angle lens should also be used, even with center filter, a opening of f / 16 or small, otherwise unsharpen effects can be created by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the great exposure areas of today's filtering and film scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter using a shell filter using a Centerfilter on an image. the algorithm is protected by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three shelves, you can control the Vignettification filter and control three additional exposure of the target.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light amplification at the point of the largest density. the standard density is 2.0, resulting in an optical filter with a aperture setting of 1, or random to compensate a greater degree of vignetting to compensate, reduce him to compensate a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Leuchstarch, contrast and gamma settings: the editing of a picture with the Vignettification correction reduces the luminosity of the pixels. you need to adjust the exposure of the target images with these options. the regulator do only have positive values, because you need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a fine tuning of the exposure of the target image, you let the values for luminosity / contrast / Gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digiplug; image processing from the menu color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignettification correction to a picture. the original picture (1) shows the Vignetting in the corners and (2) the correct image. a leukamplike- and contrast correction was also done in the picture with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The digiplug comes; Linking distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses an copyright protected algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool is working with geometric distortion. colour distortion can not be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree is treated with the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of third volume has a similar effect, but flattened on edges. this correction is not applied in the mold.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of gravity corrected the distant corners to which the second ridge. if you combine these two, each geometric distortion is virtually eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">Generally: this value controls the strength of the distortion second ridge. with negative values, tonnage can be corrected and positive values.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the thickness of the distortion. this value has stronger than in the center of the image. for most lenses the 'corners parameter has the pre-returned pre-sign of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scaled the image size, resulting in a correction first grades by. negative values increase during positive the image.</seg>
<seg id="583">Brighter: this value is adjusted in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you can find the best filter settings, illustrates the dialog box with a preview of the distortion. the values you use for your image are stored and the next start is used as default values.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tonnage and seasonal correction should be carried out in front of all the cutting or size changes. if you want to cut this correction as all first by. if you want to cut a picture and afterwards a tonnical correction would be the effect of the folding.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you can find the best correction to find you this tool is a vertical and a horizontal aid line. move it into an important place, such as the sea view or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button in order to fix lines at this spot. in the connection you can correct the tonnage / kissenular distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you corrected a cold-shaped distortion is the resulting image of black corners. you can remove this with the cutting tool into the menu, remove any of the image processing or via the zoom regulator of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most pictures, the next logical step is enough for some motifs such as photos from the front, frame and paintings, it's the perspective to correct the angle in the picture 90 degrees. note that when you keep the camera with the hand, you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the amount of tons-shaped correction to a church in Norway. the original picture is under (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate infrared film data. the filter reproduces the known Ilford (TM) SFX200 Iinfrarotfilm, see these URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window you can choose the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse, you can view the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can simulate two parameters of film grains and film sensitivity (ISO). activate the option to simulate a highly sensitive film. the ISO knobs changes the amount of film grains and the dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature) in the conversion. green meadows will white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter colour channels reproduced to reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos because the Farbinaries are missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of infrared cinematic film based on a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original picture is under (1) and the working picture below (2) and the sensitivity of the film has been set to ISO 400. higher ISO values produce a type of Aura in the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digiplug; filter trailers is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film grains on your pictures. this is known from classic high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the movies, the manufacturer large silver grains of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film effect gives you a certain mood or seems to move into the past. the treated picture gets rid of a timeless atmosphere release from everyday life. if you want to photograph this special, gallery, strings photography, grained photos, so you have to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the knob the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the body. the default value is although higher values need to be adjusted to ISO-2400. if you need more seeds, you can use the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film grained on a black / white picture. the original picture is the (1) and that worked (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digiplug; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting. it uses an urberized algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digiplug; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance, like an oil painting. natural pictures and styliants are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two knobs to influence this effect. the upper one chooses the brush size between one and five. thicker brush are better suited for large pictures. smoothing controls the smooth or, from the other hand, the Scharfulness.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting-effect. the original picture is marked with the (1) and the editing pane is marked with (2). brush size for this 640 pixel image is 1 and smooth 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digiplug; filter charcoal drawing uses color and intensity gradients to produce a cabbage box. the pictures whose gradient can vary slowly but are not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you would imagine what scene you would have chosen to sketch out. this would be good pictures to start with it.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two knobs with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob chooses the size and the lower adjusted the contrast (smooth).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the charcoal filter. the original picture (1) and the changed image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digiplug, filter engraving shaped your picture in 3-D, as if it was stamped in wax. it uses an copyright protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digiplug, filter engraving is a fast tool for giving your pictures with a 3-D effect. it works especially well in pictures with a simple structure, where color does not use the most important object. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey, monastic landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering. a value of 30 corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the working picture (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of distortion effect. it uses the copyright protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divides the picture in cells, and it can be seen as if it is seen through glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analogous to the wave blocks 1, the picture is distorted here with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects need a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time with the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by unsharfe effects. it uses the copyright protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Insharfe: impregnated the image along the formal lines coming from a center. this simulates the unsharpen of a zooming camera and thus produces a dynamic expression of often in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radical implantation: caught the image by rotation of the pixels to a center. this simulates the impresses of a turning camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distances: wiped the image to generate the effect of a non-focused camera inse. the object seems to occur in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion-sharpen: impregnated the image by horizontal movement of pixels. this simulates the implantation of a linear movable, z: B: from a car or train photographing, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Characteristic of softness: wiped the image soft in the dark and strong in the brighter tones. this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour-photos or to add a warm and subtilting incanding.</seg>
<seg id="620">Schüttelunsharfe: wiped the image by random shifting of pixels and simulates the unsharpenately moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent Unsharfe: find the Faraddling pool in the picture and wiped out this without the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: shares the photo in rectangular cells and created it by filling with an average pixel size.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects need a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the button finish.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice small tool to make rain drops onto your image. therefore, it gives natural your pictures a great look. it uses a Pieter Voloshyn-protected algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Dripping size allowed to change the size of the drops. since the tropics size does not grow automatically with the size of the image, it is often necessary to reduce the size for small pictures. number changes the number and density of drops. fish-gen changes the optical effect of drops on the image.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can use the & digiplug; imaging a range of free from raindrops. use the tool to select the area, e.g. a face, that should stay free. if you start the filter Regentdrops, the area will remain free of rain drops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the regent felt Filters. the original picture (1) shows a calm sunset and the worked picture (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can bring it by mirrors or turning into the right orientation. the tools can be found in the menu, turning and transforming mirrors.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo inflates is definitely one of the most developed tools in order to enlarge a photo with a minimum loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">A picture to smaller is simple. the big question is how you can find a picture of bubbles and the details can be found here? how can you find the missing information or guess? the CImg algorithm is used here, making it a good job. try it and you'll see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo is the wrong size you can change it to the desired size with the tool size. choose the size of the menu and enter the target values in the menu and enter the target values below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool used to change a linear Interpolation method to increase the pixel error. if you want a small picture with better quality, then try the tool for bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image processing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. Spline Interpolation to enlarge a picture. & digiplug is a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to set the tool as you want to change the size. these settings are available in tab new size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Keeping the aspect ratio: if this setting is activated, the aspect ratio of the original size is retained at the input of the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects greater structures. the higher this value is needed, the more will be smoothed, since then it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh's Turbulence effect, it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">Buttons Save as well as loading can be used precisely. each photo file can be stored as a text file and later reloaded.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo inflates is very fast in which it makes, but it can still last long and a high CPU load after yourself. you can stop the calculation at any time with the button finish.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see an example for photo bubbles by adding a small paint image to the double size. the original is (1) and enlarged picture (2) is the result of linear standard magnification compared to comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">The cutting of a photo is not only a frequently performed surgery but also a commonly used tool to assemble a photo. the mouse is simply just the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and drag the rectangle, then you will see this rectangle during your mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you release the mouse button, the area of the photos will be cut off. thus you will get a good overview like your photo after cutting area. you can pull the size of the rectangle with the corners of the rectangle, simply create a new rectangle by clicking with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">As soon as you are satisfied with the assignment, use the push button of the image processing in the tool bar and the photo is tailored (Ctrl; + X). use the entries to Save or File Save In the menu file to save the newly designed photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview area you can change the size of the rectangle by move the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog stays.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool, you can specify the orientation as high-format or lateral format. in the portrait format, the larger value of the height and in the lateral format of the width is assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool for aspect ratio is used to cut a good aspect ratio. this means that it is always equal, regardless of whether you are centimetres, Inch or any other physical size. you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and its side ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to choose the selection automatically horizontal or vertical.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below in the dialog, you can use the Max. ratio button for cutting up to the maximum possible, depending on the selected ratio and orientation, set.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool adds to the aspect ratio depending on the image orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you are using the cutting tool, these settings are displayed as standard values depending on the orientation. the modified image dimensions are shown in the EXIF tables so that the EXIF data can be reflected and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">Help the implementation of the implementation help allow to help advice, that you are better to put your pictures better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonious triangle: harmonious particles based on the principle of similarity. like the third-rule, harmonic triangles have a possibility to divide a rectangle in similar harmonic triangles.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden center: the golden center is a split that is made up of different natural growth models, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell, or the leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all possible things that we find as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden pitch is the error number 1,618033988... and you've already used to construct your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is from Fibonacci Episode 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; from where every number is equal to 1 equal to the sum of their two advances. the resulting particle is 1: 1.618 the golden middle. a composition that follows this rule is considered a visual harmonic.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides liquid aid lines if you put an image. these help are shown below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spiral will generate good results for your photos. compared to the third-party gel, the golden spiral is a liquid line that can follow the eye through the eyes. this kind of composition leads along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetric visual flow on this type.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule are the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. it should be something that the eye can be at the core of the composition. this may be a line that can be one line or different objects. this can simply be done without the eye, it will fulfil its task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The golden triangles also lead from the above-discussed golden spiral. note that in contrast to harmonic triangles, golden triangles no equilateral triangles. diagonal to the lines can be found a static object of dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles to start your frame, create a effect of professional photo symmetry. try your image focus on one of the intersections and other visual information into the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you can not reach any other.</seg>
<seg id="659">The Options Horizontal mirror and vertical mirror images can be used to mirror harmonious particles.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the colour of the aid lines. if you have an image with many colors and a high contrast, the auxiliary lines can be invisible. on this way you can customize the color of your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate a picture of any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, then it happens easy to keep the camera not exactly vertical or horizontally. this creates a picture where things to have an angle. you can select this with the & digiplug, image processing and the tool free rotation. choose this transformer and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your picture with the slider angle. the values on this slider are specified in degrees. with the default settings you can reset the slider to 0 degrees. a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are shown on the right above.</seg>
<seg id="664">To help your help, the Module Free Rotation provides a horizontal and a vertical line. after moving it over a key point of the image, you can attach it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle like in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After shot an image, you'll find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. a way to repair this is the function transforming from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is automatic cut. choose one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option fits a bit by rotation. however, please note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perceptive transformations are carried out by a fixation point to the so called reference point. this point is represented in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares in the corners of your image. the preview will then be recomputed automatically. on the right side of the dialog box you will find some information which help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: displays the width of the new image, including the empty areas that are created through the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including the empty areas that are created through the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Top left: shows the current angle in degrees on the upper left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Top right: shows the current angle in degree at the upper right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">At the bottom left: shows the current angle in degrees on the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Below right: shows the current angle in degree at the bottom right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective the picture becomes a bit dirty. for a single adaptation this effect is small, but two modifications produce a double as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After getting the perspective, you get unpleasant triangular holes at the corners. a way to bersome is the picture with transformations from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The shooting tool is used to move a part of the image into one direction and move the other part to the opposite. this is no rotation, the image will be distorted. in other words, a rectangle is transformed into a parallelogram. you can start this module via transformers.</seg>
<seg id="679">Scissors your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. if you press horizontal and vertical at the same time, you can adjust the angle to zero. a preview of the effectiveness will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target will appear on the right of the preview window.</seg>
<seg id="680">To help your help, a vertical and a horizontal line will be embedded. move the mouse to an important point such as the lake, a wall of a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to attach the lines to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After having carried out the shooting, the picture becomes a bit wiped. for a single shot this effect is negligible, but two deposits generated twice as much as lost and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the shooting, the image has triangular holes in the corners. a possibility to eliminate these is the image with transformations from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digiplug; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write. those available formats are therefore possible from your system and, in some cases, from the way as these libraries, you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digiplug.</seg>
<seg id="684">Due to this dependence on other libraries, it is impossible to specify a list of all available file formats on this site, but you will always find JPEG and TIFF.</seg>

<seg id="687">Imcompression is the use of data compression procedures to digital pictures. so redundant information is reduced to save the image data to a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. generally there are better, glattering results than JPEG in the same compression ratio. the 2000s version can also save loss when this is given in the settings.</seg>

<seg id="844">All images will be scaled automatically to the correct size for the selected video format. in addition, you can choose the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD players. to burn the media you can only use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You must first choose the images that will be packed into the mpeg taschau. after that, you can create the module via extras MPEG Diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images selected by you are then below picture files in the portfolio. there you can also change the photos or contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should select the other settings. the video format can choose from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you plan to select the file on a TV, you must default the corresponding TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most probably the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds. the speed of the image will be specified below. a lower value generated very sudden, a high brightness is very smooth.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set as next. in doubt you should set them black. the name and path of the created file can be found under name of the MPEG-output file. keep the extension mpg as possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you have an audio file in the name of the audio source file, then you can begin with the button. after all the settings of your computer, you can quickly drink the production of your computer. depending on the speed of your computer you can quickly and enjoy a coffee in all the rest when you return back.</seg>

<seg id="852">The print assistant allows several pictures to print together in standard photo sizes. the combined images can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gimp. this is e.g. a sense to improve or print out with the Gimp module for direct expression.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import your images stored in the RAW format in one of three formats to JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dcw by Dave Coffin. an original box of Him is: expect of dcraw not that it creates the same results as the software from your camera manufacturers. sometimes you get better results with dcw better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First, select the raw file that will be converted to and launch the module. the Raw image window appears then in mode for a single picture. with the button preview you can preview the effect of your current settings.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversions process. the first option decides, whether the camera settings can be used for the white-equal values. however, the basic parameters such as Gamma, brightness and Red / blue amplifier can be adjusted. if the result isn't optimal, you can further edit the picture later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected to use the contrast information. if your camera operates in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">As soon as you are satisfied with the preview, you can select one of the three output formats and the conversion result is equal to and only the extension is adapted accordingly. JPEG uses a reliable algorithm and produces the smallest file size.</seg>
<seg id="859">The tagged image format, TIFF, retains all information about your image and uses the loss free LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you are frequently asked to edit your images or later, you should not select the JPEG format, since it is only a limited number of operations before the image quality deteriorated. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you are using JPEG format, the metadata that are contained in the raw file are stored in the JPEG file in the EXIF.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted your settings, you can start the conversion button. if you want to break this process, you can stop it off.</seg>
<seg id="863">The stacker processing mode allows you to convert various pictures at one time. therefore, use this mode if you are sure, for example, by testing on a single picture which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for single pictures. however, this is helpful if these were produced in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all pictures in an album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to renaming all images of a album. you can set the prefix, the starting number and the timestamp of the file.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of several images from a image collection. it uses the image program from the ImageMagick package. you can reduced the image or enlarge it into four types of image changes:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in a dimension. the width or height of the image is automatically selected depending on the image orientation, the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2): size change in two dimensions. here the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option to adapt your image to screen size.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio will be changed in this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Print preparation: preparing the picture for the photo print. the user can set the printing resolution and the size of the photo paper. the target picture, including background size, margsize and background color, is accordingly adapted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected pictures with your favorite e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the connected images in advance. further images can go on the list of linked images and place there.</seg>
<seg id="873">After which you started the module, the pictures window with the displayed images displayed. on the button images you can add more images to a file selection dialog. for the most recently selected image will preview a preview of the right page.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag the images to the picture list and add it to the list of the pic pics you list.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the button pictures, you will remove the selected pictures from the list below the pic pictures.</seg>
<seg id="876">Once you have selected all the photos, you can open the new message of your e-mail clients. you only have to add the addresses and subject to the subject. the images are attached to you as an appendix.</seg>
<seg id="877">Do not pay attention to many pictures at once. most email accounts have restrictions on the size of the e-mails. it is possibly a good idea to send several mails if you want to send a lot of pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the pictures. their configuration is stored and every time you will change until you change it.</seg>

<seg id="887">The option file names ensures that the filename of pictures in the left lower corner during the presentation is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop loop ensures that the presentation in a final loop is displayed. you can then take it manually with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option images randomly chose the images displayed in random sequence. so it is not used the sequence of pictures in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">In delay between the images can be set between the individual images. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effects. you should always be able to show your friends!</seg>

<seg id="899">In the browser window you can see the categories you have entered when you have entered your pictures and videos with annotations. in addition there are entries to look at the EXIF-based information, and of course the current images to look at. in the following will be described for itself.</seg>
<seg id="900">If you press the mouse on the entry, change the browser's view. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select a further person to select only the pictures are displayed on which both persons are visible. through this selection method you can restrict the number of the displayed images of a few thousand images on a few individual pictures.</seg>

<seg id="917">& Xenical album; presents two options available to create HTML pages with your pictures. it is integrated in & kina album; integrated and the other than module is available (see). in the following part of the user interface, integrated version can be created using the file HTML... instantly.</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas contents, layout and target. in the following, any area will be accurate.</seg>
<seg id="919">First enter the title of the review and a description which should contain the HTML file later. on the whole album; HTML example pages see an example of this settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, you choose whether a & no album; -export file is to be displayed on the view page. ferry information about Export files you can find in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Last you can choose which information can be displayed on the HTML pages. for example, you can avoid that information is obvious. for example, you can't use all pictures of a party. note that & none of the pictures are exported. you can therefore not use this setting to hide specific images from specific viewing lights.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this area you can determine how the HTML pages should look like. most influencing options are clearly, which is not to be made specifically for this.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images. this enables those to watch your website and supports a monitor using the maximum resolution of 800x600, for example, for example, a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer can change your page at any time. it can therefore change your images with low resolution, resulting in a lower transmission time, browse. if he wants to get a picture larger, he changes to higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting range, place the different folders and URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Most of your HTML files select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new sub-folder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you need to select the main folder where all your images are stored. this folder will be stored and automatically adds to the storage location for all future pictures. here you can select either a folder or a file by KDE supported protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your pictures, you can check this really all for viewer values. if you have created a web browser after the pages have been created, the URL you should set up here should be this folder. otherwise, the web browser should start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the files created by you are not in the final destination file, you have to copy them manually. so the import function will then need to specify the final destination of the files. this is not the sub-folder of the current files, but the basic file in which all sub-folders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The currently described positions have been related to all three of the base folders or URLs. in these, a sub-folder created, whose name is specified in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you're looking forward to a family party, a conference or somewhere else, with other users from & knotch, you may have to put up your pictures with these pictures. if you're already looking for a much time to viewing the images. if you're already very much time, you'll have to reach the pictures, recording location, etc., then you have to do with & # 1 album; this job will not be done once again.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & Xenical album; you can export a copy of your pictures into a .kim file. you can import them to your database. the images are imported with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. you distinguish themselves, whether the images can be stored in the file or whether they can easily pass all pictures in the file, so that you can keep all pictures in the file, but the file size is obvious, however, the file size is obvious.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can export a .kim file either directly from the menu file... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file along with a HTML file, this will create an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file is looking for the pictures on two times. first searches the images taken in the folder of the .kim file. the images of the URL that you have stated when creating the HTML files, this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file using the HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">The following will be described in the dialog for Export images, which you exporting the menu file...</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog box is whether to act internal or external .kim files, the following three selection options are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">With the Manually option to copy the .kim file, you have to copy the images in the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With this option, configuring the .kim file, copied & Xenical album; the images are automatically deleted for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. because most pictures have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is normally not to compress the files. if you want this, simply select the Export File.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is maximum image size limit. if you send to your friends pics, you would like to limit the images not very large. here you can limit the size that each image should say that each picture should be 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you want to select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the menu file Import... select & C Album; the exported database as described in described.</seg>
<seg id="943">The assistant to importing consists of four steps. first you need to select which images you want to import them, then, in which folders they will be copied to import images.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you are the category people of the imported file personer (if you are a swans), while this category is asked for your database persons. therefore, you will be asked to imported the categories of imported file in the third dialog box and to what are these categories in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can compare the categories of the imported file with the categories of your current database. for example, please see on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It simply needs to be nice to browse pictures and view: if you see images often, you want to view images of your Italy vacation, and you would like to discover pictures of your Italy vacation, and you might want to see all pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this handbook you will find the different steps from (1) finding the information about your pictures, via (2) viewing and viewing, up to (3) advanced topics and adjustment options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoalbum was created as a program for managing your pictures. but it was expanded and today it also takes care of your videos. in many places in this handbook it has been spoken about pictures, but often also closed videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& Xenical album; stores all its information in the index.xml file in the top file of their images. it is a simple XML file that you can copy with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, to backup to a floppy or revisions in the CVS, where you want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& Haris Album; remembers the folder where your pictures are stored automatically and uses this when you want to start your pictures. if you want to start another folder with pictures, you can start & browse the album; with the -c option. as an example: new album -c ~ / company / Picture / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Read more about the menu entry with a photo album; you can access to a window with which you can change the settings of & knot album; in the following section of the user you will be explained in the following section options.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different symbols, with which you can call on the options and options for the viewer. for each setup, a detailed help is available, which you can call the F1 key to the F1 key and click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It was described as you can set different properties for each picture, e.g. people, places and tags. you can also create your own groups such as items, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">On see the dialog that is used to process already existing groups. for any existing group you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories were mentioned already. in the dialog options you can setup complete membership groups, i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a half-member as explained in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In view the setup possibilities you can select to the list of the member groups. with the top choices list, select the category you want to configure. in the left window there is a list of current categories and in the right below a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& Xenical album; splits his modular system with other graphic applications, such as digiKam and gwenview. this modular system is called KIPI and means & kde; Image plugin Interface. can be found on the homepage of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called via the menu modules. the modules can't be described in this manual, since they are not part of & none album; however, most modules have a help side, which you can call via the modules.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules of several applications can be used together, it can be that the modules have been tested together with the demo database, before you can call it on your own pictures. demo-database can you call either via the command line with the command &gt; button &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the menu help. don't say, I would not have been warned!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules about KIPI, are very different, so it can be that some modules with & colder album; not work. this is the disadvantage if you divide functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & compact album; and other applications that also use KIPI, is that the other applications can use their images in albums. even if & no album; this type of order is not supported, it simulates the order for some modules, so that you can use the functions with & Xenical album.</seg>
<seg id="962">Simulates & compact album; the current album that is easy to monitor the current screen, so all photos that show you the picture preview now.</seg>
<seg id="963">Besides the current album & collic album; the modules are also handed over a list of albums. here you can find & Xenical album; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & no album; s browser indicates the contents of a category, for example, all persons, then each record presents a record for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will be the category that you have set up in the dialog for virtual albums. for example, if you're using the category people, & do the album; so, if you would have selected people to view and proceed to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & B album; not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the setup dialog and select the modules installed which modules are loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example for a start screen, as soon as you start & talk with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used by any other KDE application, you can see the menu and a toolbar. at the moment you can see the window that you have entered your image. in this section we will not appear on this window, and now click on the entry pictures, which shows you an overview with all existing pictures.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main features of & none album; is the opportunity to see each picture with remarks, where the image has been recorded, where the image has been recorded individually or for a bigger number of images certain notes simultaneously. if for example, on all images of Jesper and all pictures were recorded in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these comments may be used for searching and Browsen, as you can read in the section. if you want to see these notes when you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In view, you can see three lists with a text box by choosing persons, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & colder album; because you will always use them again if you enter any more information about your pics.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is to move the pictures within the list: if you are looking for example a family party and see on all 50 pictures the same 5-10 people, you can see that the names are shifted upward, which can be found faster and arrange them.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to get an alphabetical list of the list, click on the icon for sorting to date below the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected notes for each image, you would like to edit all the selected pictures and have these pictures with remarks. in this case simply click on the right and back buttons that are located under the preview of the image below.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have several pictures, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to select all of these pictures and to use the menu item added entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all in the USA. there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you can see a browser window that shows the USA as an overgroup. to view it is a special icon will be displayed on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the viewer dialogs it is possible to add an entry to an existing or subcategory. additionally, you can also set a record to make this entry into a category. attention, this assumes that you are now alphabetically sorted your categories.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the feature dialogs by making the lath that form the upper edge of the frame, click and move. you can also make a separate window by moving it outside the window.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs, that you are satisfied with the settings, click on the button options..., which offers you the opportunity to save the current structure and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also release a frame in a frame. if you want to see this window later, use the button options... and then window a / off. this process can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the entry images in the browser, select an overview with preview images of the currently selected pictures, or all images you have no filter. for example, click here. you can configure the size of the images with the middle mouse button, configure. try it simply by simply.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you use a picture on the background of your desktop, this picture will set up the background for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">If you have once click on a picture, this image viewer will be displayed. if you have not open a window with a picture viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can easily delete pictures in the picture preview. simply select the corresponding pictures you want to delete or select either the remove button or select the menu icon. now, you will see the window that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& Xenical album, you can use a solution. you can also use & delicious album; namely images can also use them stored on the hard disk. of course you have to record the images anywhere you can't have the photos stored in the database. in the picture you can view the view of & Xenical album; if not all the required images can be loaded from hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images, where the right corner is cut, are not stored on the hard disk. for example, the pictures 5-9 are available, but you can see the preview pictures; you can view the preview of these pictures. you can't view these pictures with the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see this function you need to copy files from the folders and to copy it again. if you would like trouble to avoid the question of the relevant CD now, please buy a larger hard drive to store all pictures on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu Images you can find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you want to open a little more privacy, you want to view out the images that you want to see other unaccessible menu. alternatively, you can also see all pictures that can see your little sister, and select the menu entry everything except the current view.</seg>

<seg id="1025">Each object has a visible level of visible object. you can specify this value relative to the visible level of the above object or as an absolute value. objects will be displayed only if they are selected or their visibility level lower or equal to the visual level of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object tree and view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views are shown on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the default window order, or if you need a different arrangement, you can easily set them anywhere. you can also store multiple windows arrangements and can easily change between different orders.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To emit a window over or below a view, drag the beginner to the upper or bottom edge of a view. a rectangle below shows the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, draw the beginner to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then enshrined on the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange several opinions on each other, you draw the beginner to another view. you can then switch between the views through clicking on the card card slot above in the sight.</seg>

<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can renders. & kpovmodeler; uses & Povray; 3.1g to rendering this program was right installed. when this manual was written, it was & Povray; 3.5 currently. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click on the icon rendering the icon renders in the toolbar or select the menu entry for scene renders.</seg>
<seg id="1037">An Render mode corresponds to the entries in & Povray; s INI files. it determines the image size and quality of the rendering. if you want to insert a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can easily add many Render modes, from a quick preview of up to full-images in the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the Symbol The Render settings in the toolbar or in the menu View Render mode... select the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each Render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but it is a name who can recognize the properties tab for this mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the map size you can present the width and height of the roasted image. if you want to render only a small area of the image, select the check box below and enter the image section to the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the combination field quality, you can choose the features that are using & Povray; for renders. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diffuse reflection-lighting. an extensive description of the Render features can be found in the user manual & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is rendered by only one pixel per pixel. these pictures often have a moirè pattern or tier effects in curves and lines, and they are sometimes not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to decrease the influence of this error. generally, images are better from this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you turn on anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray; more than one beam per pixel. this technique is called super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; the second method is adapted-recursive; recursively, because each pixel is still subdivided and adapted because of the calculations of the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray pursues a beam per pixel. if the difference between color values would be set out, then both pixels will be adjusted by the persecution of a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you calculate the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 is calculated additionally, with a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays each. if the difference between color values exceeds the predefined threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixel, which can be controlled individually and on further subdivision. the maximum depth of records can be set with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to decrease the aliasing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process, called Jittering. if you turn off Jittering, change & Povray; the rays of a tiny amount to avoid frequent samples.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of the renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; this is the diffuse light reflection. it takes a long to compute a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map card you can adjust whether the alpha channels are to be calculated using POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent if the small beams had no object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly, you can find the reason here.</seg>

<seg id="1055">Currently, & kpovmodeler; yet not the full command-catch of & Povray;. when importing error messages or warning, a dialog window displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source code in & kpovmodeler, please write this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawend.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can also draw objects from the object tree into the editor to import the source code for & Povray; to import objects into the editor, select the source text in the editor and draw him in the slide tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copying and insertion in & kpovmodeler; and in your Editor you can add source code for & Povray; also included.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called, if & kpovmodeler; a scene renders. usually this povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on the help in their own-based view, & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; user documentation to the displayed object. set the path to your documentation and the version. it supports versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>

<seg id="1064">The colour of the rectangle for the view field in the camera view and in the windows type label.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object's object in the context menu of the open context menu. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and rotations.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values give you a more accurate wire model and therefore a better stress for the displayed objects, but require more time to rendering. for some objects like the sphere, you can adjust the detail level for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross high detailed projections for extended projections, all wire views are further divided, when the camera uses an extended projection, with exceptions from perspective and vertical projections. this property makes a better rapprochement for the projections, but requires more time to rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you cross a wall, a wall is placed behind the objects. the wall is displayed in a box pattern with two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you cross the floor, a bottom is placed below the objects. the floor is displayed in a box pattern with two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">When you cross the edge of edge, non-recursive anti-recursive anti-aliasing method is used. the values for depth and swelling can be set. more precise information on the parameters can be found in the Render mode.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this site you can change or replace new window arrangements. in the window arrangements, it will explain how you can use window arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The Combination field Standard Window System: shows all existing window arrangements. & kpovmodeler; the chosen window is used during the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The Miscellaneous window displays shows all existing window arrangements. a new arrangement allows you to add and delete a selected arrangement with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Any type of window is identified by the name. the name must be clear and cannot be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below the name shows all views for the chosen Window. new views can add to the button add and remove selected views with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with the new column you create a new column on the right side of the existing window, with unlock windows, you will receive a map card view together with the previous view and suspended the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you have just & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you would like to follow without more precise knowledge of both programs. if you follow all steps in this tutorial, you should make the ultimate race very popular: one ball on a plane.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should keep following warning messages before you complain about that you can get as a result only a black screen. if you use a 3D program, you should note these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you don't adjust the camera, no rules can be applied to the rendering, as a result, get a black pic.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you do not include light sources, your whole scene lies in the dark and you will receive only a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have any Error-free, see the first start from & kpovmodeler; the following pre-installed window scheme:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get the menus and the existing symbols of the tool bar. read the documentation to allow you to get a reasonable presentation of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols to be frequently used, so you should notice the menus and symbols and their applications.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. in order to follow these steps, you need to remove all objects from the slide tree. select the scene and then select the menu entry. thus you have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire Model View shows how the camera shows the whole scene what you generate. in particular note that in the fourth wireless model view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the viewpoint of the camera. this is the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The slide tree now contains a new entry containing the name camera. if they click on it, check the contents of view object properties, where the various parameters of the camera can be found. in the user documentation on & Povray; find further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change anything to the basic settings of the camera, but note that you can change the camera in view control points, with which you can change the target point of the camera. just click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you press the button user or the input, change the wire-level views and the slide tree immediately after this settings. as a result, they see here the scene from the viewpoint of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the floor for the scene. you might set a quader (insertion body quader) and the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a controversial method for the solution of this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually offers a simpler option. you can use an infinite plane as a floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the plain in the object tree, change the name and press the button user or the intervention. in the slide tree, the new name is now displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The Wireless Adapter view now shows the level even though at the moment only as a limited level. if you render the scene, the plane stretches out to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you can view the object tree exactly, you'll notice that you can click on the icon + before the object. in this case you will find only the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shift. choose one of these options, change the possible settings in the view of object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene, you should move the soil to exercise a unit under the horizontal line, just in order to know some of these parameters. select shifting and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First choose the floor to set up its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose a bit Easy at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog where you can choose to choose how the object should be inserted. please choose the name in the property view (name = soil pigment), with one click on the button preview, like the pigment now looks.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of pigments just shows a matt black material because you can check the appearance of materials anytime from any time with a click on preview. also there are plenty of options now, but you can now take the easiest way.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see a color on Quader and ball, click on the button to push the button and then call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you hit your image now with one click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course you don't have the colour benches. in the color list you have to enter two new attributes. then edit this entry twice (you can do this also more frequently, but the Schachbrett-color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the slides, select the colors in the slides and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">You should already simply execute this step since you have already understood the basic work of & kpovmodeler; the ball can be just as simple as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of object properties, you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: to 1 (don't forget to push the input button or the button to press), so the sphere is floating on the ground as you shifted the bottom to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, the rendering now gives a selenium result: as already before, the puffer appears like a matt black material. set in the following step an appropriate material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have chosen the ball, you can now assign a material now. as already on the floor, enter the sphere of a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Choose an object subject and change the name for example in sphere of pigments. click on the sphere of pigments, select one color and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve even more interesting effects if you take time to adjust some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Change the values as in the following screen photos and click on user or press the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings of shine-effect and reflection have already shown good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromium-plated surfaces, even if metic: not even selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of it which offers you & kpovmodeler. hopefully you have already learned as much as you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracing is a Render approach to generate a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you rake a scene of hypothetical rays from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera that reflected the scenes) through each pixel by the objects, the visual effects of light sources reflected in the scene and how atmospheric effects can result in such as an atmospheric effects of mist. this will be the scene of pixels for pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will not see without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you see the scene. without a light source, you see nothing, the picture is simply black. obviously, any scene need to be taken, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In usual file dialog you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Open a file. in default file dialog you can select a file that you have previously created with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open a new model or create, the file is inserted into this submenu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you are already saved the model, it will be saved under the same name. if it is a new file, you must enter a name and disk space.</seg>

<seg id="1120">Repeat the last command. repeat this menu entry only if you use it on the paths.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Stores the current window conditions and opens a dialog where you can type a name for a new configuration or overwrite an existing arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu, you can find options for setting & kpovmodeler;, here you can change the appearance, the keyboard cut and the default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog for changing the keyboard shortage. you can change or add new commands to this option for & kpovmodeler with this option.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens up a dialog for setting up the tool. you can add and remove any tool symbols for & kpovmodeler with this option.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A Bump-Map is a way to provide rough surfaces without changing any hives on the surface without changing without the geometric shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file both for a Bump-map as well as for a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic body are simple geometric shapes that you can use as blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens of or even hundreds of these basic bodies. these models are then further processed to give them a realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object colour based on pixel basis, using an image file as a colour card.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kud show; is a comfortable picture viewer and browser. the application features a file browser where you can select pictures for display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>

<seg id="1183">The DCOP-interface of Amarok has many general functions that are mostly found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and should describe the DCOP functions of collection, context-browser, player, playlist, playlist, playlist and scripts. a sample call for the DCOP-function could cause & zb; look like:</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the command line options of Qt and & kde; Amarok still has some own command line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user a feedback if the script may not run because of a lack of dependency. please check in your script if all the required modules are present and use kdialog, so the user does not running a script.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Begin require 'Corundum' Rescue LoadError = 'Corundum (KDE Bindings for ruby) from kdebindings V3.4 is -for this script.' the dialog --sorry '# {error}' 'exit</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the scripts / templates you can find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use it as a basis for your own scripts, or simply expand the required functions. you'll quickly find that the script is relatively easy.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP, your scripts can be exchanged with Amarok and Amarok. the simplest way is the use of command dcop; whereby each KDE installation should be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripts said the result of external programmes and commands. this way, the function exec () is used. this way, dcop &gt; can be called relatively easy. here's an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& amarok; sends messages to all current scripts. for this reason strings are written to the standard entry of the script. for this reason, scripts might want to monitor its standard entry and react correspondingly to events. of course, a script can also ignore the events if it does not use it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure the script to display the dialog dialog. in order to save and loading the setup data, Amarok will start the working folder on the folder where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange that a new piece is played. the script could now be & zb; with DCOP-features you can query further information about the new piece (for example the metadata or the unit length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Volume change newvolume signals a change of the volume. the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Customise Menuclicked: SubstitemTitle: contains the path to select the selected menu entry, if a custom menu entry can also be handed out. in order to add an own entry, you can use the DCOP-function dcop amarok script addalena MenuItem (Substitemedia). to remove one entry you can use dcop amarok script - eCustomMenuItem (SubstitemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & amarok branches; or if the user stops a script, sends & amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed, for example, storing data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks Script administration can also install script packets, which can also be compressed using bzip2 (.tar), which can optionally be identified with bzip2 (.bz2), so that the user can clearly recognize the archive as a Amarok script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& amarok; 1.3 will accept only script packets with the widget amarvocal script. for this reason, you should rename your script packages equal to correctly.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main thing must be executable (+ x), the remaining memory modules should not be executable. use the Tar parameter to obtain the file's right:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is ready, you can upload it to www.kde-apps.org and put the link to the Wiki scripts page of & amarok; put on your entry on kde-apps you should use the category amarok; scripts.</seg>

<seg id="1485">In this chapter, we assume that you can use the command line program dcop. in order to use & DCOP; you need to make sure that & K3b is started; then enter something like the following on the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">In addition to the general & DCOP; -functions that have all & kde; the program supports, supports & K3b; mainly two parts which are described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The Standard DCOP-interface of & K3b; features features like copyCD, format DVD and other functions for creating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPSóller createDataCDProject () DCOPRef createAudio CDProject () DCOPRef createVidevixDVDProject () DCOPRef createVidevixDVDProject () DCOPRef createVidevixDVDProject () DCOPRef createVideo DVDProject (). copyCd (). copyCd (). copyDvd () ,-format Dvd (), misnCd image (KURL url) -burnDvdImage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method you can create a DCOP-reference to the newly created project: # K3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project can be obtained via the # dcop K3b K3bInterface currentProject. using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectinterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the top-listed K3bProjectinterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectinterface that can only be used on data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">CreateFolder (Qstring name), createFolder (Qstring name, QString Parent) -addurl (KURL:: List URLs, QString Parent) checkbox Item (QString Quartet, QString Parent).</seg>
<seg id="1492">So it is possible to fill out a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders and then add files into the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop K3b K3b K3b interface, dcop $PROJECT createFolder dcop $PROJECT createFolder / foo dcop $PROJECT betateFolder / foo dcop $PROJECT betatefolp / / file.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& audiocreator; is an audio CD; is an audio CD; it can be read and saved in MP3 or OGG files. other formats are possible, depending on the encoder that installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& audiocreator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; data files in WAV files on hard drive) and by many codiles that are encoded for OGGs and FLAC (This coders must still be installed from the Linux distribution). further coders can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First the title of the & CD; read out and compressed in WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step this WAV files (usually one per title) compresses into the MP3- or OGG format or other formats such as lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading & CD; it is used by & audiocreator; cdparanoia uses. almost any distribution has been compiled a pre-compiled package, if this is not installed, it must now be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other Koeng. all these programs are usually installed for any Linux distributions, but only the code packages are installed, which will not need to be used. if for example FLAC cannot be used, the installation is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1500">What Kodizer / file format is to be used? this is a small introduction on Kodierer, audio quality and quality factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copy protected audio CD; s: as already said, uses & audiocreator; cdparanoia for reading audio data from the & CD; this program is not possible to avoid any protected audio CD; it is not possible to avoid any protected audio CD; even do not avoid the mechanisms of copying protection. avoid the purchase of copy protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While the setup must be performed only once (the setup dialog can be called up until a suitable configuration), the daily handling of a & CD. this leads to the hard drive. this leads to the slim approach of the user interface, which you will be able to stumble at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert multiple formats - depending on which encoding programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; get information from the freedb or can work completely without any network, whereby everything is driven manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of commands from the main window. on the page step by step, you will find further information about how this program is used as well as screens with descriptions of registers for the configuration of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">The CDDB file is based on the CD data according to the device CDDB. (this may be locally or online, in the latter case must first be made to the Internet.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Start reading and - if a encoder is configured in tab settings that was configured in the setup dialog for encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">A sub-menu opens with a list of the available Encoder so that the selection with another encoder can be read as default. it is necessary to note that previously the encoder is configured in tab dialog for dialog settings.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager so that an already selected file is selected to encode a full & CD; read and encode your file.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the dialog dialog to configure the type of alerts (such as protocols, pieptics) for programmers (as read the & CD; terminated).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main setup dialog for & audiocreator; with different cartoning cards (such as Encoder, to set the Encoders). you must go before the program can be successfully used!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, coaxial and compression ratios and helps you to choose from the right code.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is lost, there will be a lossless audio format. besides FLAC, there are other like 'hormone' or 'Monkey' which may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices to play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats, the information transmitted via data compression according to their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG may have a slight advantage against MP3 in the audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps) but above that bitrate the differences are less important, as both coders will generate very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'not so 'free, lame is still supplied with most distributions, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high to very high sound quality (high rates) but compared with OGG slightly lower quality at lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG files is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - If music is also part of other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard disk) or special car stereo systems. today - initially 2009 - support these devices usually only the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for the audio quality and resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for other parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting makes good transparency for most people and most of music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer to most people and most music pieces acceptable transparency, and has quite high quality. good enough for stereo stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 up to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3 kbps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for stereo stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate approximately 5.5. needs always 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need cBRs. good enough for stereo stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate about 11. 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good genug to music by young people, portable devices and auto-testers. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most of the people and most of the environments without any backdrop to the file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information, which are entered manually or by the program automatically from freedb over the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can be delivered / used with & audiocreator; and the code program to generate the folder and file names and the characteristics of music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with coding programs, there are often a combination of program settings for the encoding and these parameters here. the manual or assistance to the codes explain the switch for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example to add the & CD; title to the keyword (English: day) if MP3s with lame are encoded, the switch -tt of lame and the Title Parameters of & kaudiocreator; the result looks as follows: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & audiocreator; parameters, which can be used (= button name in the assistant):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database that can download the information up and enter the information, so that all the other information can be able to enter into the machine: & CD; Title, Artist, names of the pieces & etc., not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I am not attorney. however, nobody can prevent you from the & CD; more or less valuable, thus neither the artist nor the music companies can be added to the music company. all the information can be saved in a Bummel by a & CD; business, physically or virtualization.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & audiocreator; is active a check box. for use by freedb, it can be used with another (counterfeit) address when the server is not used. in this type of configuration, it seems, the e-mail address is not used to retrieve the server (this can only know the programmer that has the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are many countries copies of the main database. if & audiocreator; to use freedb, the geographical on the next mirror server is needed. this saves bandwidth in the network and compares the load between the machines.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freed.org delivers a current list of mirror servern for the online retrieval of & CD; information while reading a & CD;. alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually recorded monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which is a reading program is used to store pieces from the & CD; to store WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumors that cdparanoia is used; who wants to be more precise, search in source code.... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD; see note that the cdparanoia package has to be installed from the appropriate distribution first if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the read WAV files, the code file can be selected and thus select the file format. during the first opening there are predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) on the tab card. other coders can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The codile package needs to be installed from the corresponding Linux distribution prior to the code required. this is also necessary for pre-defined codile. more information about coders are in the chapter of Welcher code.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a codile you can obtain further information on his switches as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console). thereby 'lame' will be replaced by the name of the installed Kodierers.</seg>
<seg id="1540">That can have many causes. check the device of the device label of the & CD; / DVD drive, the write and readjustly of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, FLAC & etc;). try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal. that could indicate what is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want to read a copy protected audio CD; check out the shell & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, this tips can be specified as you must proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, but they are still uncertain what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-for-step example, and you will get enough information to establish those ranges that want to make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time to create everything and our first & CD; we'll be lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 up to 256 kbps on average and ID3v1 keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as precompiled packages for your Linux distribution as it is considered not completely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please ensure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and you have write permission to own (eg; try to copy with the queror something into it).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic integration of & audiocreator;, something is thought to be done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the preview for triggers a & CD; which must be repeated for every CD & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the compression coders for compression of the music (lame) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 up to 256 kbps). since we are lazy to use the program to use the freedb to download the & CD; data from the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Even though we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not be able to read any & CD if you've found the matching settings.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is handed over to the feedback program to read the & CD; data / pieces can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Frequently is / dev / cdrom a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive. if this is not working or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive can also be accessed, so a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the entries available on the device records for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The card card General Settings. here you are not much to do here. here it can be defined as an additional conversion. in our example, everything will be checked / entered as shown in screen photo.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only in case of incomplete information, you will be informed when information regarding the creation of keywords (tags) are missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The cartridge card CD; default settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and let the & CD; data automatically download via the Internet from a freedb computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the calculator must be connected during the release of the & CD; to be connected to the Internet in order to access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection box is easier, a & CD; entry is found immediately, if you are dissatisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / file names or file names, can be changed easily. the directory or file name is changed using convocation - &gt; rename and the ID3 tags with Kid3, dem & kde; tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, if you want to enter all manually, activate the selection fields and freedb is not used. however, these more than 620 MB large, consider this twice whether this is worthwhile. in order to use freedb in the offset mode, the two selection fields must be selected, at least the first. the mode is set up on the following box card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is for us freedb. these are settings for the data subject, for the call & CD; information from freedb server over the Internet. how does the system know which data will get the CD? read the section on freedb. set everything as shown in screen photo.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we don't have downloaded the database, we only want to work with remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB-Server: please go to the freed.org and look at a mirror server nearby. on this way the load is distributed between the machines. this setting will however function as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both operate the same as the server, as many Firewalls will boot the protocol 8880 standard, there may be more luck with the protocol 80, as the & HTTP; protocol usually open to surf at the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we don't want to transmit any & CD; data to freedb Server. the first check box should be enough.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take the settings of screen photo. (make sure the folder / tmp is on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneously equipping pieces: excuse, there is why more than one at the same time when using existing drive? parallel reading and encode? the author doesn't know, therefore try to try.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last piece: cross this to the & CD; take out at the end of the trial.</seg>
<seg id="1567">User-defined file for temporary files: if you can cross this folder, then the path / folders can be specified. if the box is not enabled, the files will be created in the private folder. don't forget this folder when you want to make something with the WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">All in such way as it is on the screen photo. the command is somewhat long, under circumstances must see anything according to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as already mentioned before, it is sufficient for very good audio quality, even for very good stereo audio systems. the resulting rate is approximately 224 to 256 kpbs. the compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for the restriction of production of tags on version V1 / V1.1 'ID3v2' tags can be used when needed. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tagger for & kde; in case of subsequent modification of the tags.% f and% o are internal variables available for the name of the input (including the complete path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest like in screenshot. some comments for future use outside this sample:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously to codile WAV files: with a Dualcore or Quadcore or even a multiprocessor machine can be tried to encode more than a WAV file simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we've just finished the basic setup of & audiocreator; this configuration is used as standard for each read of a & CD; if you have chosen the organisational structure of your music you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section is described as the process of expression of the & CD; we will create MP3 files. first, the file structure is set up and set up. first, a connection to the internet is set up, since we are comfortable and the & CD; data from the freedb is described, must be repeated for any type & CD; repeated in this section.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we are a & CD, which is not yet contained in freedb, see the screen photos a bit differently than those for a & CD; so you will learn the & CD; you will learn the data manually, instead of them from the internet. comments are pointing to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not to find the & CD; this example is a 'special' edition of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this has not yet come to happen, the & CD is now, in the drive that has been defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment, the pieces and its length should be listed in the window, as in screen photo. this only if the & CD; as audio CD; could be identified and by cdparanoia can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not done, then look for the questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section concerning the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD has been successfully picked away from the freedb, all title of the songs are already filled out, and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In case there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; key for your & CD; there will be a window embedded in, and you can select the database entry, which your opinion is best on your & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you don't have the check box for the automatic query of freedb (on the site & CD; settings in the dialog for Settings) you can also purchase this manually by selecting the first button in the toolbar. if you have no local database, you will need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 02: the CD Editor - Input of the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Specify the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen photo one. title of the piece in the first line of the 'Update title', the rest of the data in the input field 'album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist must not be entered into the 'Reeller Title', unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower commentary box can be used for the individual comments inidijell per piece, the comment field of the album is used for comments which apply to all the pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful recall of the data from freedb, the CD editor is not empty. however, it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD-editor (e.g. if all words begin with grandletters or not...) but also to check if there are any unwanted notes.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we use only ID3v1 tags for the artist, album and title of a piece and at only 28 characters for the comment range. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have set unlimited field length, at least on the code card code settings; take a look at option 'basic settings'.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the created files later with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags will not be supported by all codes or file formats, and you can see in the help of a coater to obtain more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that is obvious to the style of the concise CD; this example is not important because we do not transmit the & CD; for more information on the website of freed.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are available under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' you come back to the main window. just click on line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD-Editors will be back and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we have recorded for the first piece. just enter the entries for the fields of the actual product. the title of the piece is definitely and other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and process the same way until you have entered all the title data from the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window appears not when you have downloaded the data from freedb. it is sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the tool bar. note that the artist and the album will be displayed on the piece list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check-sign before each line of a piece. only the titles are selected. make sure that all the pieces are selected, or informed the button All pieces at the bottom edge of the screen to choose all the pieces at one time.</seg>
<seg id="1598">When clicking on the button select the outlet process, this window appears to be confirmation. click OK, and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track up what expires.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the riders tab for switching on the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly under the buttons of the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control the commissions. the first piece is just read on the disk drive. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message you see if you are trying to work with a body if you haven't installed. pieces that were not successfully encoded with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the tmp file and the target file are not what we have entered here in the example. have you checked the write access to the folder for temporary files and target folders?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it's clear why the error occurred right after the end of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The task 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the coding of pieces 1 into the format MP3. thus, read out and coding in parallel. note the status in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has found no configuration attitude to suppress this behavior. the only difference being configurable is the result of parallel processes to read and encode. the use calculator with a AMD64 seems to have no problem when simultaneously read and coding (from however two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read, while another piece is coded, and a third order is encoded in the queue of the Kodizer. after the last piece is coded, a small window will be built with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & audiocreator;, you will need & kde; 3.x. or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to generate compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG, you will need the code of your choice.</seg>

<seg id="1629">If you find that a song can be played quickly or too slow, you can click on the arrows on the left and right of the template. to get the original pace, double click on Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The Leertaste has two tasks: when one piece is played, a pressure on the empty string works as a pressure on the button pause, or selecting the menu entry in the menu, thus breaking down the reproduction. if you want to play the void button during no piece, starts & kmid; the reproduction.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Song lyrics can be stored on two types in a piece of music. some pieces use textures, others use lyrics and again other both. some pieces have no text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can adjust what events are supposed to be displayed automatically and even better: the event type is automatically determined by selecting a song, so you will automatically adjust the Karaoke text automatically. but you still have the opportunity to change this if you want the other way you want.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set a type of event, select from the menu settings the entries textures / post-setups. the same function also have the buttons 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files which you summarize. these will be played in the series. in this section it stands as you can efficiently utilize collections.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager first. find out in the menu collection under the point of organizing.... Click on New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy a existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs like the original.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set up the desired collection.</seg>
<seg id="1638">In the temporary collection all songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application, this collection will not be stored. act if you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song by adding a song. it appears again the file dialog with which you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on the setup automation software.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When Automatic Adding to the collection is enabled, a piece when opening (using file or drag & drop) will be added automatically to the active collection.</seg>
<seg id="1643">When Automatic window is not enabled, the collection will be activated and emptied. this collection will then be added to open pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click on removing.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the sequence from the sub-menu sequence of the menu collections, the songs are played in the order, as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add songs or remove any random sequence in the menu, the order will be redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager or use the selection list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To navigate a song, select the Next song, next song from the pop-up menu or press the arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump back a song to jump back the button, select the previous piece from the menu or press the arrow to the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection and click on the button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection can not be cleared. however, that doesn't matter, since it is not saved when leaving & kmid; not stored.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers, which are not general-MIDI capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map General-MIDI events will be translated into events that understands synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map, which change all events of Change patch patch to Bright piano in events of Change Change patch to Trumpet, thus making a trumpet sound when originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have only one soundcard, you don't need MIDI-Map because all sound cards are GM compatible (incl. Awe - and GUS cards, FM devices, and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">Unfortunately, there is no programs to create MIDI maps, so you have to edit the corresponding file by hand (with your favorite folder).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-Map is a text file that all required requirements for playing a piece of play.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may appear only once, except for the KEYMAP section, which may appear so often as desired. for this, however, that each appearance has different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END define KEYMAP "Name of Keymap..." END define CHANNELMAP... END options... END options... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that it is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for options) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as email, so I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support can offer devices that are not general-MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section it is specified as the patches from General MIDI to your specific keyboard. the general use looks as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equality sign is ignored. it is believed that the GM patches are in the right order (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order, and no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional allkeysTo M is used to put all sounds that this instrument does not need to put the sound with the number M. if your keyboard supports the sound (GM-Patch 127), you can use a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which is similar to a defendower. for this purpose, you can tolerate the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if now a MIDI file should play a note with Patch 127 (defective), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which sound is located in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that with the term Drum patch the patch is meant that each sound is another percussionary instrument (drum, basins, Maracas & etc;) and is not the one that means the sound height of the always same drum (as some keyboards have the same drum).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is used to specify how sounds are shown on a specific channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As in the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as well as their presence. you must create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keyboards for each channel and each instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keyboards are mainly used to form tones on the Persian channel. take a look at the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to transfer some channels to others. if you want to replace the first and second channel, make it simply the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards which have the percussion on a certain channel (General MIDI to Channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, according to the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is depicted on the channel N. if you use the keymap option to use the name name for this channel. if you are using the Forcepatch option, all events will ignore the patch on this channel. in this case there will always be patch x used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Forcepatch option can be useful for example to always use the percussions patch on the perkussions channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for Pitchbenchratio should be multiplied in which ratio of the pitch test events should be multiplied by the value n, this will be redirected to the formula n * (r / 4096) and then only redirected. the value 4096 is used, so that in the Map file does not stand decimal number).</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is used because GM proposes that a keyboard, that should play a pitch test event with the value 4096 to play a sound higher. unfortunately, try some keyboards for two sounds up to a octave higher. in order to find the right value on your keyboard, you have to try a bit with & kmid;.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, simply open the dialog for MIDI Settings. this can be found in the menu under settings, point MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole range of keyboard (one for each MIDI channel). on this keyboard, you can only see which sounds are played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you have changed an instrument, the button doesn't turn green but red, to indicate that no more the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view (until now) has two different views to display the installed sounds. the view can be chosen in the menu settings under the point sewer view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The pace-LCD displays the speed when the song is played. the higher the number, the bigger the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the pace of a song. for example, if you find a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the pace, use the arrows left and right from the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece must be played. it contains the notes, rhythm, speed, & etc;. thus, the same MIDI file can lead to two different devices with very different results, just as two different musicians can play the same banknotes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can do not use, & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while a mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, the speed & etc; you have control over all.</seg>
<seg id="1685">That can happen if you have a binds (rpm, deb) of & kmid; that happens because & kmid; without AWE support compiled. to eliminate the problem, you need to download and install a source distribution (for example of kmid; 's homepage)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole file to a collection, but I have no desire to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agree, therefore supports & kmid; Drag & Drop. open the folder you want to add in & conqueror;, select all files, and drag them to the & kmid; -window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Before necessarily, enable Automatic Adding to the collection. otherwise, the files are added to a temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can select the arrow move to the left from Tempo- LCD to slow playback. in order to restore the standard tempo you can click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have on a & kart; -Desktop with my MIDI files and & kmid; on this desktop (if I want to play a karaoke file) or attached (if I want to play a karaoke file or I want to play a file, only in the &-queror; -window to change and drag the file into the window of & kmid;.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen to a file quickly, without having to add them directly to a collection, turn the setup Automatically adding to the collection, and the new; file is added to a temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let's suppose you have MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. if you want to play the first file. so, set Automatic Adding to Collection and Open A.mides your temporary collection then contains a MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">And then, join the B.mid and C.mid play and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I see these songs or see postcard, animated me, next to & kmid; to program.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez, from Maths; Laga. at the moment I am in the third year, so I'm trying to take a lot of time for my hobbies, but I try to collect some time. as Hobbies I have programming, MIDI files, music make and phrases prove.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where they want to download MIDI / karaoke files, if you want a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you simply want to make me happy, write an email: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrais.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really make a huge joyful thinking, if you send me a postcard from your residence or a MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. if you want to send a postcard from & kmid; if you want to receive a MIDI file, you should contact me when I've got the file.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have & kmid; completely written in my leisure time, written by no one for money. I want to emphasize that I only get back the race because if I get feedback from users (postcards or e-mails).</seg>

<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer, because the sound quality is considerably influenced by your sound card. it is not the same if you use a FM device or a AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you have no sound card, you have to compile & kmid; with the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL, it will run as if you could have a sound card, except that you cannot hear any music.</seg>

<seg id="1706">& kmPlayer; is a simple interface for Mplayer, Phono and FFMpeg. the program is used to play video files that supported by MPlayer or phonon supported formats, as well as to play DVD's, VCD or TV and camera.</seg>
<seg id="1707">The documentation for & kappname; was not yet completed as & kde; installed on this computer.</seg>
<seg id="1708">For additional help, check the page The KDE website to new releases, or send the question to The & kde; user mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The application window is formed from so-called andockable windows. there is always the window with the top view. alternatively, there is a window with the playlist. and finally there is a information window that will only appear when you are subject to it.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to choose the preferred connections under the menu bookmarks, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries, you should use the category Permanent playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchestufe. if you copy a record, his group and all its sub-groups will be copied to the current category and playback begins with the associated entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current pieces', television and thumb playlist can also be changed via an editor, but also through the application itself. in addition, the various files can choose from the menu list, but also through the application itself. in addition, the XML content will select only the XML content of this partition.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, the menu must be selected with playlist, or select either the edit mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost when working mode leave or select another group without the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Due to the convenience of the author of & kmPlayer; some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files..</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation at starting and finish can be deactivated through the editing of ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and change by [General Options] No Intro = 0 above option on '1'. if the option is not available, it can be inserted simply.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate any other animation. & kmPlayer / share / kmplayer / €.xml and ~ / .kde / share / kmplayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation at start does not need to be short, it will automatically terminate through the opening of another source. this would be annoying with the end-animation, the user may terminate the application an second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start-animation can be up to a favorite photos: & lt; bodywork; & lt; IMG = "Meet" / / / home / mum.gif "fit =" Meet; & lt; / smoothills; In list tests tests / some examples of SMIL the von & kmPlayer; are supported.</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a rider to configure Mplayer in the configuration dialog of & kmPlayer; here you can set the path from the MPlayer and the Interest memory of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the button 'console' in the tool bar of kmplayer. here is the issue of mplayer clearly.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no rider for this playback device in the configuration dialog of & kmPlayer;. everything must be configured by manual processing of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / config / kmplayerrc, such as the setting of the backend by mimetype. here is an example of a 'flash' with the swadditant Mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash' can be played within & mplayer; it can even be inserted the special box embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">So that the & kmplayer; 'flash' can play in HTML pages, the & kmplayer; module as a service provider for the Mime type application / x-Shockwave flash in the setup dialog for orders of KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Konqueror & kmPlayer; is used in any consoles application to browse the library's library. if there is no error occur, the backup issue is within & kmPlayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">In order to use a predefined backend for a certain Mime type (of course only if this was also determined), it must be done by manual changing of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / config / kmplayerrc. for example phonon all ogg files are used:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& kmPlayer; can play by TV tickets, either using MPlayer or XVideo (this needs cxvplayer). before TV can be seen, the scanner will be used on the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">For configuring the VDR (Video data Records) settings in the cplayer, the dialog can be detected in the settings - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port. there should ports be detected, which is intended to be found. the encoding must be found (e.g., it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably included a DVB.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR can only use XVideo to work only XVideo (probably this kind of playsite does not work on Linux). this is why the videoforlinux expansion must also be used for the X server. for the XFree86 server, this is therefore not included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config).</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally they are used by KMPlayer for sources of different names. at the time of creating this documentation, this dvdnavsource, dvdsource, tvsource, tvsource, vcdsource and vrsource. if they are activated, they start playing the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Are there indications like I can do my CDROM drive, if I play from him (not from the VCD: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the command hdparm -e 8 / dev / cdrom game can be run as user root after adjusting the device. it is absolutely safe to adjust / dev / cdrom on the CDROM drive.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Xine starts only slowly, why do I have to test my CPU on their performance every time?</seg>
<seg id="1734">Note: the answer is overtaking. kxineplayer needs automatically the last stored value, only the first time will check xine the CPU.</seg>

<seg id="1777">Once the above source code was entered, the & latex code must be compiled. the simplest way for this is the use of the menu of building or the button quick construction.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be stored in front of the compiling. & cile; for storing the storage automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1779">The compiling of the document should be searched for errors according to errors, should be started automatically when using quick construction & eyepiece; this is not the case, also the protocol changes should also be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1780">A environment (English environment) is a text that is described differently than the remaining document. for example, a report with the font is created. for example, the svn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ Documents (English) is to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The changes are only covered within the environment (from\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\).</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many mutations for the threat of readability and usability of the document. for example, certain fonts, grease printing, cranial pressure, subsubmissions, etc. added to the end of the environment. these commands are either complete with the command\\ or automatically at the end of its surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ Begin {emph}: this command is for the cranial pressure and is as long as long as long as it is closed until it is closed with a\\ by {emph} or another environment. a single word in a set can be displayed with\\ emph {word} curve.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ Quote: created a quote in the document. the quote starts with\\ Begin {Quote} and ends with\\ as {Quote}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background to write the source text by & latex, a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & kile is followed by step-by-step guide.</seg>
<seg id="1786">As soon as soon as an assistant was entered into a bit text, a few adjustments for the better reading of the document should be completed. this should be minated, a few places in the fat and cursive impression and a poem to application to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">As soon as the document has been viewed, can be returned to the editor by Editor-View or Ctrl E (on the internal panel). at an external viewer, the window must be closed.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI; file has been created, the document can be printed or converted into a & PostScript; PDF file. simply try and fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is a high-quality file format (English. D V V ice I nd.). these files are created by & tex; or & Latex; for the reading of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output like printers, & PostScript; / PDF file converter or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI; file are the same steps as for creating the document (see). after clicking on DVI, you can print the document using file print (in the viewer) (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The tool bar enables the conversion of DVI; file in other formats. once the DVI; file created from the & latex; source code was created, the conversion in some other formats can begin with buttons in the toolbar.</seg>

<seg id="1794">To search for the occurrences, the mouse indicator has to be positioned in a line of the source text and close to preconditions. the jump to the corresponding site in the DVI; panel viewer will then be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece; with one click of the middle mouse button in DVI; -document the corresponding & latex; -document by & kile; geared and to the appropriate line. for this purpose & kile; as text editor will be defined as text editor... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">If using quick construction of the & DVI; viewer will not be possible, an error can be found in the protocol file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The log file converted the error source in source code. in the Editor then the buttons can always be used between errors. the log file is always displayed on the error in the error. to view the faulty line, the error code must be clicked on the error in the log file and / cile; jumps to the incorrect line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once the button in the tool bar will be clicked, a window will appear on the selection of the displayed template for the document. the default shows are:</seg>

<seg id="1803">When creating the own template, it is therefore necessary to know what variables are replaced by the variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string will be replaced by the input in documentation class. typically, they will be used as follows:\\ standard class [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {article}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The simplest way to create a template is the use of the assistant and the result of the precepts in the editor. once the document was created in this way, the following steps will be completed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, the own template can be selected rather than the standard.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template may be created from any & latex; a simple way to create a template should be sought after one on the Internet and through the steps below.</seg>

<seg id="1931">This dialog allows to manage all plugins and add new plugins. we describe each & GUI; -element to:</seg>
<seg id="1932">Here you can type the search engine. when adding plug-ins without a storage location & quantitative information; this path leads to the search of plugins.</seg>
<seg id="1933">Often working on a project several people work in a kind of hierarchical relationship. & quantitative information; supports team members and these can be configured with Shift; F7 Project Properties Project Properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1934">The name and email records are self explanatory. Nickname is the nickname of user and serves for unique identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">One member can have several roles in the project, such as team leader as well as Subproject leader.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can choose from the list of teammates, who is it. this happens when he is expresses the team member from the list and press the button. the current member (its identification) appears to be fat after you are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Top names and setting of its own identity are important for messages and notes. see for further information about remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1938">In addition to an overview of your team there is another advantage through the number of members of the team: it can be an event going to the team manager if something is done. see for further information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that are executed if a certain specific project is happening. one example would be the record of opening and closing of the project, so that later, if a file is secured, or a script that plays a file in CVS, once they will be added to the project, etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the side event configuration of the Shift; F7 Project Settings dialoges can be created, edited and deleted.</seg>
<seg id="1941">An e-mail is sent to the address selected in the recipient list. the address can be a team or sub-project leader. see, wei such ladder can be set up.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Notes are special comments in documents. they differ from normal comments by the following things:</seg>
<seg id="1943">Note remarks is simple. it may either be selected using the editor-context menu or the @ annotation keyword in a commentary area followed by anguext text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Annotations can be sent to a particular member of the team. in this case, the syntax called @ annotation (top name) or @ annotation (role), whereby the nickname of the project leader Subproject leader In addition to the range and subproject leaders should be given the appropriate range or subproject names, as in the examples below.</seg>

<seg id="1948">The settings can be called Quanta... the settings can be called. this dialogue extends over a few pages that will be treated with one another.</seg>
<seg id="1949">The behavior of & quantitative information; regarding tags, vehicle completion can thus be changed. the entries are:</seg>
<seg id="1950">Large / Classification of tags: large / Classified Tags: size / Classification means of automatically added tags: tags will be inserted so as they are described in tag.XML files.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Large / Classification of Attribucks: large / Classification of Automated Attribucks. regular Groß / Classification means, the attributes are added so as they are described in tag.XML files.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Optional tags automatically shut: if any act will be charged for tags, for which the closing day is optional, this immediately after getting & gt; inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1953">Not optional tags: like above for all other tags with the exception of simple tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Start and finish day automatically update: if enabled, the corresponding day will be carried away and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatic replacement of accent characters: controls the automatic conversion of acute characters in corresponding coding during use.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Mime types: mimetypes for detection of different types of files. by using the standard, standard pre-set can be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Standard string coding: the coding of newly created or in other way to open files (where the encoding of the file can be addressed). however, this setting is outsourced from the same in the project features, if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD is not recognized. this setting can be read from the same in the repository if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Create a backup copy: & quantitative method: created on a regular backup of a power failure or crash when the next start of the program can be recovered from this backup. it is not the same as the saving of the file. even for the stored documents, a backup file is created, according to the set time, created.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and documentation can either be displayed in the editorial area or a private view (or documentation in a cartilititer), which makes it possible to view the documentation, preview and source text at the same time.</seg>

<seg id="1964">Here, the parser and the structural tree, representing the diagram of the Parser nodes in the document, is set to details.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the context of mouse click on the structural tree, the following action is possible to amend the action by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the area of structural tree settings, the Visibility of the tree can be opened automatically when changing the tree tree into the editing and how deep when changing the structure tree will be adjusted automatically. empty nodes are the empty areas in the text, whereas empty groups are such that no element has been found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The range for fixed abbreviation of abbreviations (a type of templates) can be unfolded in groups, each can be applied to multiple & DTEP; s valid, it may be a valid group for PHP, in which the ifc abbreviation is valid as in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Here the plug-ins are managed. plugins are of the third page that can be used by each Kpart-enabled application, most well-known & conqueror;. when inserting a plug must be indicated:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to plug-in if there is not in a standard place such as $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>

<seg id="1971">Specify the component in "Only-read" mode: check if the plugin may refuse to store. only Lese-KParts refuse to load the load when this option is not chosen.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plug-in: is this enabled, then testet & quantitative information; if the entered information is right. please select the saving of the entry even if the plugin at the moment is not available, but it will be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For Procaplus; from version 3.3, the troubleshooting has been completely redesigned. the support for the no longer necessary built-in & PHP; (3) Debugger. instead, the support for the DBG debugger. instead, a debugger plug-in concept has been implemented that allows different implementations over plugins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only a plug-in is available, the support for the use of & gubed; inquantitative address.</seg>
<seg id="1975">Use of the debugger for a project starts with the selection of a matching Debugger plugins in the repository settings. using the button options, next to the debugger plug-in selection box, specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger is activated, some additional elements appear in the & quantitative method; user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view that is displayed in the content of monitored variables is usually displayed in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view, where all the holding points, with line numbers and conditions are listed. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view that is shown in the issue (as in HTML) of the debugger. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the debuggers, everything is available or part of the following functionality.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this promotion, the connection to the debugger, if necessary, or it divides the plugin with, on debug requirements. this promotion will be called by default, which must be a debugger that will not be kept in normal case.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The opposite to debugging session starts the session. closes the connection to debugger or end the lute to meet requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends a HTTP request to the server to initiate a debug request. this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document. the issue of this requirement is shown in the view of the Debugger issue.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Refers to the debugger, to begin the execution of the script and to send the line through the outgoing variables as well as the currently completed line. if this happens, the version is continued, before a debugging request starts, the script will start with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Refers to the debugger to begin with the execution of the script without informing information and the current line number. if this happens if a script was done, the version runs after a debugging request starts, when a request is made.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger leads the next statement in the script without entering the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger leads the next statement in the script, whereby if possible in functions and include settings.</seg>

<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s are available in two types, family 1, the markup languages and family 2, the script languages and / or CSS;. & DTEP; s are made of two parts, the tag file and the toolbars. tag file are handy, symbolism deadlines of picture buttons (above the editing window), the text and instructions quicker into a document when a user may each.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be established manually (see below), downloaded or automatically created from an existing DTD. see for details about converting.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how to create TagXML files, then the & descriptionrc; and also toolbars. shortly, an & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.day) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the Featuresdialoges, the & quantitative information; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. tool afford provide a fast insertion of tags in a document without a risk of writing.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folder are nothing as a folder. they contain only the & descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folder bear the name of the writing language and version, so there. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of TagXML on and clear whether they are necessary, or not. although not all are necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible to allow other users a better viewing and more information on working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and boundaries will be explained in simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a TagXML document. it can contain only once in a document. it may contain the definition of many tags, but it can only contain anything about itself.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The Tags of the tags is a script function. when using & lt; attr &gt; an argument of function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Valid for the class type class. the name of the basic class for this class. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only valid for the Type Method. returns the name of the class to where this method is heard. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the day has a common attribute group and the attributes inside this tags can be added to any other day. (only family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Requires a text in the dialog. this text is determined by the & lt; text &gt; -day. that's a single-element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Describes a attribute of a tags. this element can only occur once for each attribute. it sets the name and type of the attribute. additionally, it contains further tags that will describe how this attribute is supposed to be displayed, etc. this is an only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Gives the source texts used for the attributes in the day of editorial dialog and attribute tree to the attributes.</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantitative information; is used to reach the source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the names of an interface. dcop method name within & quantitative method is used to achieve the source of data.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, an interface and method name. the arguments that are handed to the method. can be empty, or% day name, which means the name of the current tags.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A tank-tag that grouped together the elements of a list. it can only occur for an attribute description only once. it is an element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specifies the position of the attribute a tags within a dialog box. this day can only occur for each attribute in a dialog (e.g. once for each & lt; attr &gt; -day). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Returns the position and size of a field in the dialog. this day should be present for every field in the dialog (e.g. one for each & lt; attr &gt; and lt; label &gt; Tag). this element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">Specifies a list of elements that may occur within the defined tags. this element is only an element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">There is a list of elements that end a day. this element is a single-element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must start with a & XML; -Deadation start: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be nequered and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces may affect nothing but do not affect & b & lt; characters. these should be by & amp; and & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; text &gt; will be replaced, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the tools dialog is to start at the top & quantitative and check the TagXML. to choose. another dialog will appear to follow its simple follow-up.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available. currently, check only when charging the TagXML files in & quantitative information.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following an example of a family 1-XML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; Element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the file name for this TagXML file should be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">In the following an example of a working family 2-XML file. this file is described by a & PHP; Transcharge function is described. the file name of this TagXML file is intended to be overloaded.</seg>
<seg id="2023">& lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; & lt; tag name = 'overload type =' class "&gt; & lt; attr name = 'class" status =' string '/ &gt; & lt; / day &gt; & lt; / day &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2024">The & descriptionrc; file is just quite simple and there is an editor that can be achieved via DTD edit DTD settings. it can be processed by a list of selectable & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; a simple & descriptionrc should be created with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[General] version = used de 1 for & quantitative informus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for any higher version. name = DTD indication. (/ / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not stated, the name is used as nick name.</seg>
<seg id="2026">A action can set up action with Settings.... click on new action to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">This action is assigned to a button. with clicking the button, button 1 can be assigned to the button. the current keyboard cut is awless.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The easiest actions. it can be entered into the detail settings and in version of the action, this text can be inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this promotion, you can change external applications (or parts of the document), but it is not limited to the document (or parts of the document), the quickset up dialog or the different see in... actions for the (X) HTML-DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and interpreter must be given. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Though qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptyou variable in the command line such as sh% scriptdir. by the script file: $KDEDIR / share / apps / quantitative / Notes / quantitative / Notes / quantitative / Notes / quantitative file: $PATH There are other special variable that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we replaced with the URL of the current documentation. in case of a local document file, file: / from the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: is replaced with the PID of the current & quantitative method; when the text is running, the text can be changed to the PID number. this is useful if DCOP is used to control & quantitative information; the external script is used.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the file name of the current document or the path to project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the mentioned methods, a script input from & quantitative information can be accepted by default. in the selection box input, input can be determined, which is to be sent to the standard entry. options are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected range of documentation is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually only accessible with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the executed application can also be redirected. there are two ways of issue: normal output, to the standard issue written; error messages can be done with which to the standard issue written by clicking the default value output:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the market-up language, it is recommended to do the tags in logical groups. in the case there are not too many, therefore you can create a tool bar with the name of the market.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a tool bar is added, you must add actions and configure their settings.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are rather self explanatory. press the New Action button at the bottom end of the window will start scanning mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill out all the required fields and add them to the matching tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete all and if the day attribute has and you planning their use, activate the dialog "tag" when available to use one input when using the action.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is this a ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this icon? replace it before we have trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that the action is better, we will use & kiconedit; choose from the & kmenu;, graphic more programs (or where else it is located in its distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; used by default 32x32 Pixel, but we need 22x22. to change this, select editing size others.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created icon does not only helps you notice that the action does, but also all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">In regard to that the day start, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. due to the use of green (green is usually interpreted as los, rigid, further interpreted), or should select at least to select a message to the user that clicking this symbol.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol, it must still be connected to the action. this is done by the menu with Settings... (in & quantitative information;) and selection of the required action. in addition to the text box is a button, press him.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Choose the folder where the stored symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the user button and continue with other tags, so it gives or confirm to complete with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to supplement some usual & quantitative information; functions to the toolbar or it should set this to better overview by some trner in multiple groups. open the toolbars set up with Settings tool. make sure the required toolbar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to choose the separator (quite left) for my tool bar. after selecting the element, the tool bar is to be added, press the arrow button to the right. this add the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I want to add a quick way to access the Konqueror preview. I will select it and add to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how to support the grouping. someone who doesn't know my tool bar can believe that the & conqueror; -button on the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new tool bar must be tested by test all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Insure you in the right folder. after reeXML it does not exist, it will be saved in the proper folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the proper file. please adjust your toolbar (s) if a file is opened by the appropriate type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the chosen extension of & quantitative enlargement of & quantitative information; for the normal user is the option to add documentation for the script language or the formation of the script which you like a & PHP; -document tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you could check the & quantitative repository; Repository if anyone has done this for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to create an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; -language. then you have to leave the docrc file. we'll have to leave the first part we deal with you the second.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE Configuration File [Tree] Doc Doc = Sec2.3.html section 2 = Section 1.html section 2 = Sec1.html section 2 = 0.1.html-1 = 0.2.html-1 = 0.2.html tag1 = tag2.html tag2 = tag2.html tag2 = tag2.html tag2 = tag3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">Section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the document tree. for example, see in & PHP; documentation so something:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE config file [Tree] Doc You = php42 / # top level Elements top element = PHP 4.2 Open = Table of Contents, # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html transmission = HTML... Language Reference = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = polage.basic-syntaxes .html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this shows that it is a sub-folder in tree with its own contents. there is no known border for chess boards (except through the Reason) mdash, but try it out.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents directly reference to a file is referenced (and consistent, at the upper end of the building view & mdash; folders will be displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces may affect nothing but do not affect & b & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantitative information; Resourcendatry can be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The section of section is the range of docrc file, which is to be rendered to the design of the context-sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP; the documentation of the mysql _ fetch _ array function would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file connections.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of showing separate context elements that should be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can easily save your file docrc and if you are using $HOME / .kde / share / doc or $KDEDIR / doc / DOC / quantitative / doc or $KDEDIR / doc / DOC / quantitative / doc or $KDEDIR / doc / DOC / quantitative / doc or $KDEDIR / doc / DOC / quantitative / doc or $KDEDIR / doc / DOC / quantitative / doc or $KDEDIR / doc / DOC / quantitative / doc or $KDEDIR / doc / DOC / quantitative / doc or copy / quantitative / doc or copy your HTML documentation in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these good and it's worth to be divided, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. what documentation were used to the & quantitative method; -Community. they will not be rich, but proud to have been working with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantitative information; you are not alone. it is possible to share the separator resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent via email to friends, partners or else. at different places there is a email-sending menu like DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, toolbar toolbar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive from where all the other & quantitative information; users can download it, if our team needs them correct and useful for the release. in order to sign a usable contribution, why it guarantees a GPG / PGP keys. this means the source of resources is ensured, both for our team as well as for the later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you're asking for their private GPG keys (the Passphrase is not stored), or in the case that you have multiple keys, you can fill out a dialog box (URL preview can remain empty) and with clicking the OK upload.</seg>
<seg id="2074">The uploading can be uploading from the menu DTD DTD package (DTEP), tool toolbar uploading, and can be started in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, even before the installation, was examined & quantitative information; the integrity of the resource could be warned. if the integrity is given and it can be broken down. if the integrity is given and the resource is properly signed, a message appears with the specifying of the originator of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML languages which is currently not being created by & quantitative information; it can be used to work by a DTEP package. the construction can be time consuming because hundreds of day files can be required in tag.It is easier to change a DTD package into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">Converting a DTD menu and converting a DTD menu. select the .dtd file with the DTD description which should be used. afterwards, the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Destination name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name into the $KDEHOME / share / apps / quantitative / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! DOCTYPE Defined parts: the drawing chain that appear in the! DOCTYPE tag such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional.</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of DTEP after conversion: if enabled, brings & quantitative information; after conversion the & descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantitative information; there are some key concepts. to understand these and full use of & quantitative determinus; this chapter must first bring to them exactly these concepts, without their understanding & quantitative; little use.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantitative information; the working area is divided into three areas: global, locally and projection area. these differentiation concerns a number of components in & quantitative information;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are for each, the & quantitative information; uses, available. from toolbars over actions, everything that is marked globally is stored in the common folder of administrators, actions and patterns in the global tree, which will then be available to each user in a multi-user environment at the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development agent for a single user. that's custom patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">The project complex elements are available only within a specific project. this can be everything from & CSS; patterns up to toolbars with special actions especially for the files of a specific project. simply said this is the most limited size. all elements are stored in the folder's folder. all elements are emitted by all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The ICaplus; MDI; consists of some main areas: the Editorwindow, the construction views, the antilions, with information and toolbars. please propose to information and information about these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the mouse button with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current documentation, re-charge, delete or upload the document, jump to an bookmarks or version of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Legal action in the Editorzone lead to a further context menu concerning the machined tags, using basic processing steps (copy / copy / insert), editing the mouse pointer or opening the file if the string is described under the mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the upper end of the Editorsters, the toolbars of the Editors. currently, & HTML; 4.01 Transitional files as standard, for which a set of tool can be displayed. in the course of further expansion of & quantitative information; the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and thus connected correctly needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of tool afford is really easy. if they want to insert a single day, then click the symbol that represents the day. now, you should add the data for this just entered day. if you want to add several attributes (such as anchor), you can fill in a dialog to fill different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The building prospects (QIT;) allows you to open and navigate in the information about & quantitative informus; in the diagram showing cartiliters are available for files, project, sample templates, documentaries, scripts, attributes and documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that provides & quantitative informal. this view shows all the files in the project and allows you to manage files in the project via right mouse click. promotions such as Adding, removing, upload, upload files from the memory medium can be done with which then displayed context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another option of & quantitative information; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: images, program parts, all web page & etc; There are all possibilities available.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories, depending on the connection they are used. the category is based on & quantitative radius. global templates are always available, local templates only for the respective user and templates in projects are available only in the project. more on templates are available.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available scripts. the concept of reintegration in Global, Lokal and Project also works here. by clicking with the left mouse button you can retrieve the available information to a script. via the right mouse button, you can send another functions like the script, edit or send an email.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view, shows the internal structure of the active document. the cursor in the document is set to the position of the element. due to the right-click of an element, the cursor will open a list of commands to navigation and navigation of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree will appear under the other building prospects. with it, lack of attributes and namespaces can change. that allows the modification of all available attributes with a few clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the documentation of the web technology for your development. it can be downloaded from the quantitative documentation for & quantitative information; the document site can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project can be edited, edited and viewed.</seg>

<seg id="2106">& Proaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE surface. & quantitative information; it was optimized for rapid web development and combines a combined development environment with a variety of powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2107">During effort, the best & HTML; Editor began to employ the developers of & quantitative ideas; what would be if & quantitative informus; a standalone, extended market-up languages? well, this would make it an absolutely great web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer on pure & HTML; limited, is & quantitative information; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. together: if you can define it into & XML, then you should be a quantitative & IDE; for this it is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Now, to the aforementioned claim must be noted that & quantitative information is based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & kart; development community is based on the idea of why. thanks to & kde; rumor is not only this everything possible, but it allows users and developers, & quantitative information; such as they need it for their need.</seg>

<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your opinion before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">A lot of high-loading profiles can be created and thus the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. when processing or creating a profile, this dialog will appear:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the server name that should be copied to the files. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The Transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and installed KIO slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (locally) and NFS.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for transfer. normally it needs to be changed, except the network administrator runs a service on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your anxiety, this is either a timesaving function or a danger. use it after your discretion. the password is stored on the plate, so it cannot be read, but each with programming languages can easily see in the plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only a set of files and toolbars. it can be put into a project many views, i.e. by simply divering the view can be loaded several files and toolbars and replace the currently open files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be opened in the menu Project or the Project toolbar, reachable via Settings Machine toolbar, open or deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantitative information; with which one has most to do. this helps not only increase productivity but also allows the adaptation of & quantitative information; to its own work.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As already mentioned above are toolbars in & quantitative; best by the menu toolbars. use and adding. Adding toolbars is treated below in the section add toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbars and the symbols can be set either through the context menu (right click on the toolbar), in which the new tool bar can be set, there can be other actions such as toolbar, tool bar, renaming, can be specified in the dialogue, where the actions can be visible on this or other toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menus for a tool (icon) on a tool bar, additionally the entries will be removed and action-processed, that are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The tool afford and the actions on them can set up in the menu with Settings tool... and set up settings..</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are shown in basic documentation, code-cutel and files for linking. & quantitative NAS; uses templates basically as a usual filesystem with advanced organization and interfaces. you can copy, postpone or any one on the existing folder in the template-tree. templates have templates & quantitative information. in about the restrictions you can set up for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some articles with & quantitative information; provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions at the beginning of any template before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is all that is not pure text. it can be inserted any file except text, i.e. images, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc. binary templates are usually inserted in documents by means of shortcuts (e.g. pictures with IMG src = / src / url). some examples are available in the template under global templates. further information about templates are available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created from any text documentation. based on this templates, new documents can be created. normally, a simple scaffle for the purpose and organises the work in a proper way to be efficiently. some examples may be found in the template under global templates. see for more information about templates.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This type of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area should always be inserted into the documents. you can find everything from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl basis. some examples include templates under global templates. see for more information about templates.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name suggests, these templates are available for whole websites as templates. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a file structure, together in a compressed tar-Archive. currently there are no examples in & quantitative information;.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Transform a document structure to exposure (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;) and select File As Template, save as local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">As soon as it is done, note that (even if it was stored as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. check out in the fig tree under repository.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click the template to store selection as local / project template. alternatively, the selection can easily be drawn with pulling and finish on the template templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only be used in a template-folder. for example, all file management functions can be used, so about pulling and transfer or insert via the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can select in the file tree or in the project files building view to a folder right and backup site template to ensure a name for the template and secure. by default, it will be stored in the repository, but of course it can be used as local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates allow a very target-oriented approach. you can create headlines and footlines or dynamically with & PHP; it can easily add files or linked with them. in addition, you can keep some things when using templates into projects very profound in eye.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template's structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files stored in $KDEDIR / share / apps / validation and $HOME / .kde / share / quantitative / apps / quantitative / apps / quantitative / apps / quantitative / apps / quantitative / apps. each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers, as stated above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">In order to define the behavior of a folder with the right mouse button, click on the folder and select the context menu properties. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is hidden as soon as elongated attributes can be attached.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is reactivated by default and fits everything except the stem folders. if a stem file would be set there, there would be templates that appear in this path, except they would be explicitly enabled. in case of normal folder, the blah would appear with something like Text Baustein. if nothing appears, it is likely to be in a stem file.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allowed or displayed text for templates in this file. this may be general headlines or footlines for a particular project and allows to equip a file with special headlines / footlines a whole presentation already with the matching headlines / foot lines.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, we have a context menu (shown on the right mouse button) via a complete command file for adding folders or copy and insert templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantitative informus; provides two modes: VPL; Editor and VPL; & source text editor that can be reached by the menu View. the first mode replaces the source text editor in two parts: source text editor and VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it invites a document like a normal & HTML; - or XHTML; -page and cursor will appear. then you can edit and select when needed for source code editor, in which the implemented changes in VPL; editor are visible in source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor on a document that contains & PHP; it is not possible to edit these directly with the VPL; editor. it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; editor, it is not necessary to edit the source editor. there is no plans to change this behavioural code.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode operates exactly like the first, except for simultaneously running the changes in the source text editor and in the VPL; editor synchronously running. using F9, this mode is already active, the scanning pressure is activated from a window to the others, whereby the position is retained in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronisation distance between the VPL; Editor and the source text editor can be adjusted via settings Quanta.... by selecting VPL; -View can be set between synchronization after a click or automatically. in general, the recommendation can be adjusted automatically. basically, the recommendation is: a small pot for fast calculator and a large sprange for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, so it is possible to choose from unvisible tags when working with the VPL; Editor is also called once a new document with the VPL; editor is also being created. this is the user to change the suspension system.</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta-tags allows the storage of information about the document itself e.g. drums for Internet search engines. meta-elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons on the bottom, e.g. key words in column names and keyword keyword Keyword Keyword Key.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way to design the design of pages in browser. you can add CSS rules with the buttons under the list or delete. a change over the list is possible exactly as with the meta elements. the editing of CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to insert a external CSS style system by clicking on the file button and select the corresponding file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The cursor of cursor is like in a text processing due to the arrows, possible. under rare circumstances, the cursor resides itself. the marking works as usual. text can be inserted by entering and by pressing a button button.</seg>
<seg id="2225">The insertion of tags will be made in the same way via the toolbars, as in the source text editor. it is necessary to note that the insertion of tags will not be removed beforehand, e.g. an anchor-day, surround with text, must any other ambient anchors are removed.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbars such as the Tables-assistant or the lists are disabled. you will later work in & VPL; you will need to work tables or lists toolbars later in this release.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; is a tool for the examination of stylisteners. in contrast to other programmes for stylisteners, the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of styliaison can be tracked.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphic tools to compare. why & kdiff3;? let me explain shortly I have written.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merger was very complicated because one of the contributors had made many changes and at the same time was changed to many places. another programmer had changed much text in the same file. the result were numerous conflicts in the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me showed me only the modified lines, but I could not see what had changed within these lines. and there were no evidence on the passages where perhaps only the entry was changed. the merge of these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">That was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; detected differences in line and amendments to white characters. later, any amount of more useful features were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">If you would like to compare it fast text, copy it simply into the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function done much work was the comparison and merge of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost in a full file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way merging is fully supported. this is useful if two persons can work independently of one piece of code and changes the original file. in this editor you can even edit the outcome. in this editor you can even edit the result. the screen photo shows three Quell files when conducting:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; helps you also perform the same and merge folder. this screen photo shows & kdiff3; at the folder merging:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; displays the exact differences and endowels the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you often have code, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabulators are displayed visible. if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters you can see at a glance at the summary in the column on the left-hand side. (no trouble changes if any one changes the inwards.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is equal, and the other distinguishes itself in one line, then the color indicate that the file is different. red color means that both of them differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but in different folders, you can make sure the tippwork will make you complete the filenames of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Diff3 folder 1 folder 1 folder, diff3 folder, diff3 folder, folder, folder, folder, type 2 folder, folder, folder, folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">The opening dialog allows manual mounting of filenames, select the selection of file names. the opening dialog will notice itself your selection and displays it at the next time. if you leave the entry for C empty it will be the analysis of the differences with two files.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Over the button file... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the same or merge files will be selected, for B and C, however, uses a folder, then uses & kdiff3; file names from A in both other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If merging is crossed, the input field is active for the objective. however, it is not necessary to define a output file immediately after saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setup button brings a dialog with Settings. here you can set options before you start with the same / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes one would like to compare all the file but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to select text parts from the clipboard into the active comparative window. the comparison starts immediately. in opening dialog, you don't need to select files, you can simply close the dialog with the retrieve button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use gypsum and shutdown: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from a editor and let it fall on a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What thought is behind this? sometimes, a file contains several similar functions. if you want to figure out what these functions are, it would have to put two corresponding files, they would like to copy and compare these relevant sections. now, you can easily copy and compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently you can pull out nothing out of & kdiff3; only the feeling of text in a comparative window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpreted the pulling and transfer text into another program as slicing and insert (instead of copying and insertion). in such a case, your original data could perish.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each text window is the info line. the info line contains the characters A, B or C, the filenames and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window is optional.) Any info line has different colour. (if the path turns to a file, leave the mouse over the line. then a small relief window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three spring star are assigned the letters A, B and C. A has the color blue, B the colour green and C is magenta. (this default settings can be changed via the settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is recognized, you can see on the color, which file is different. if both files are different, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the colour scheme is especially useful if you compare three files. that's good in the next section (merge).</seg>
<seg id="2306">Left next to the text is the interlocking column. when differences were found, the column displays the corresponding color. in some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (at C / C + +, e.g. white characters only relevant in character sets and comments, for the preprocessing and in few, rare cases relevant.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line that separates the summary column from the text, is interrupted at the places where the respective source file is not activated. if the line breaks is activated, the line will be displayed on broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (below the comparison window) has also a info-line with the inscription issue:, the filename and [Gechanges] if you have handled the result. usually, it contains the automatic merge text, but often also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts have been dissolved, the store is deactivated!!! (use the buttons to the next dissolved / unsolved conflict in order to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparative windows are used, each difference must be loosed in the same time a conflict that must be manually dissolved.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows the group is displayed in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed. (this will also be a jump from the position in the windows where the first group is otherwise visible.) This group will be highlighted by the color background color for current section and on the left shows a black bars.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes it remains below the automatic merge or by manual processing no further line more in the group; there is only a placeholder for the case that you can change your opinion, and perhaps to select another source. this text does not appear in the final stored file, still in a marking which you might have to copy and anywhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; assembling times; but appears in the clipboard if you copy the text from the output window. go out carefully with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if the sources check the options are ignored or ignores C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">This will navigate mainly with the picture sequence and mouse, but you can also use the arrow keys to the left, right, down, down, side down, side down, Ctrl-beginning and Ctrl-end, Siw as well as you can also use it from other programs. the excess columns can also be used to navigate to the navigation system.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the eye window, you can also use the other buttons to the edit menu. with the insertion button you can switch between plug-in and slideshow mode. (default is the insertion mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the interconnection columns is synchronized to view all windows at the beginning of the respective group (as already in the merge and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The tool bar contains seven buttons to the navigation with which you can jump to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-picture shooting down / Ctrl-picture downward) or to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-picture messages) or to the next / previous conflict is still considered conflict. hence, the conflict has to be distinguished between soluble and unsolved conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2319">In order to copy the markings to clipboard, you need to copy the copying button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-insert). if this option is enabled, you will automatically select the clipboard automatically and automatically copy the manual copying. if this option is carefully selected, because you might have the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Zeiling are stored according to the underlying operating system. UNIX variants are using a Zeilencub-sign\\ r\. KDiff3 does not retains the crow ending of the source files, therefore you should use & kdiff3; also do not use binaries on binaries.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and list of the most recently used files will be stored automatically and re-produced at the next start. (menu Inclusion &gt; KDiff3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Choose a font with fixed width. (on some systems the dialog also provides scriptures with variable width to choose from, you should not use it.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you activate this option, differences in cursive writing will not be displayed. if the selected font doesn't support this representation nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in its pure form, but would be displayed automatically. in these systems the button presets automatically an odd color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">When this option is activated, pressing the button button, the corresponding number of spaces inserted will be inserted. otherwise, a tab-character will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press input or return, the insertion of the front row will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is enabled, any selection will automatically be copied to clipboard. manual copying into the clipboard then.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can choose which Zeilenende type you prefer to store. the default value is the common option on the used operating system.</seg>
<seg id="2329">While the same of files tries & kdiff3; first to find all full identical lines in the source files. just during this first step, white characters can not be ignored. in this step, white characters are not ignored. in this step the white character will not be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) store a car resign '\' at the end of a row, but then they could only save a line-side comparison, although they are different. if this option is enabled, car return marks are visible, however, like a white sign. during the merge, this option must be deactivated. in the default, this option is deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="2331">The default is deactivated. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and associated signs ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored, but the differences are still indicated, but they are treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The default option is deactivated. changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensiv after even smaller differences. the option is activated in the presetting. it is effective for complicated and large files, but slowly at very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In the Automatically-Jump mode, this setting, how long the results of the selection will be displayed before the next unloaded conflict is passed.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Triggers automatic all conflicts in white characters by selecting the chosen file as a source. (default, manual selection.) This is useful if white characters occur in many files. note that the automatic selection also causes conflicts to numbers or comments if the options are ignored or ignores C / C + + comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are treated in the chapter of scanning of folders and runs through a merge. look for details on documentation on the directory comparison and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and already an older version exists, then the original version of Suffix. if already an such backup file with the suffix .original exists, this will be deleted without any additional backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adapts the language of the user interface. this option does not change the current program. you must finish & kdiff3; stop and restart to change the change. (this option is not available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; because the language is set globally through the control centre.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following code settings can be adjusted separately for each entry. if using this option, the top settings are used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">About the selection fields for coding the coding is a short notice that is the local coding. (this may not be changed, and have it purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this is how special characters can be treated and interpreted, as the encoding for each file can be adjusted individually, even files with different coding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have processed a file, you can determine which coding is to be used.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processed commands, they could not work with your codec. (for example, your files can operate 16-bit Unicode, but the preprocessing command can only establish with 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can determine the coding of the output commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn this off to suppress the emphasis of changes in white characters in text or overview. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignored or ignores C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences in a color coded overclock column are displayed. but sometimes you might only see the differences between two of three files; B, A & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C will be displayed next to the normal yet a second excess column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes one would prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines. simply enter the less important window. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">The comparison takes place next to each other or to each other. this can also be useful for ads of long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes, look at the differences and decide to merge the files. a simple click starts to merge the merge menu and uses the file names of the last source file as the default name for output file. (if this function is used to restart the file, then the name of the most recently used output file is retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file it is visible first to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor, which corresponds to your requirements. you can use this function for example, or to correct the deposit.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file it is given first to this external command. if also a standard pre-processing command is given (see above), then the output of the command is used only. you can write your own preprocessor, which corresponds to your requirements. each input line must have an associated issue line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The thought behind it is to allow users more flexibility when setting the sealing results. however, an external program is needed, and most users would like to program that. good news is, however, that in most cases SED or perl is completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this preprocessing command for line compensation to the input in uppercase letters: SED's /\\ U\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 's text in the first character string. the\\ U converts the found text in uppercase.</seg>
<seg id="2353">For example, CVS and other versioning systems use some keywords in automatically generated character strings (info: / cvs / keyword\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with SED, you might get to understand it and perhaps you may also like this regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">This ignored by numbers is actually a built-in function in Kdiff3. but it is good as an example of a further preprocessing command for Zeilenabo. SED's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Every sign between' ['and'] 'is a suitable matches, and any hits will be replaced by nothing, so virtually extinguished.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several stories at once. then you can use the Semicolon ';' to separate the translations of each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead SED you can also use anything other such as perl -p -e's / REGEXP / replacement / switches' allergidings are needed in perl some details different where SED\\ (and\\) requires perl only (and) without the four\\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor will maintain for display and merge. the other operations change only the data that the line-off-algorythmus can change.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases if you use a normal preprocessor, the line-off-preprocessor provides the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The processor commands are very useful but as with each function that changes the text or differences, you can't notice certain differences, and destroy important data in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often, programmer need to edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare & kdiff3; complete folders recursively compare and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes for each object a proposal for merge; you can customize the proposal before starting,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merge and show the simulated changes to do without it,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... brings the selected actions either with all (F7 key) or only with the selected objects (F6-key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is the same and merge of single files very similar. you only need to open folder on the command line or dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders are joined, folder 1 is used as base. if no target folder was specified, & kdiff3; folder 3 as target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of the folders will not start, do not start the merge. to select the menu item, select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (further details follow)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder you will be informed of a small message window over the current progress. if you remove the scanning of the folder, only those files are listed, which were compared until then.</seg>
<seg id="2369">If the scanning of the folder is finished, & kdiff3; a listing window with the results on the left,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Any file and folder created during the scan, click here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The file structure is normally folded. you can fold a folder, by clicking on the + / - click on the object or by clicking the arrow keys for the left / right. the directory menu contains two functions all subdirectories inside and fold all sub-directories with which you can open all folders or fold.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you double click on a file, the file expires and it appears a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The icon in the column Name reflects the type of file type in the first file (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the type of file is different in the other folders, then it is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detailed window to the selected object. in such a case, the merge action can not automatically be chosen. if the merger will start, you will be informed of the problems of this type.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the above picture, columns A / B / C are red, green, yellow and black.</seg>
<seg id="2376">In identical entries, the color is identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folder are considered as identical, if you are all the content is identical. then the folder also have same color. at folders the age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea of this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colours reflect the colors of a sheet, which is only green, then yellow becomes and later when it is old, red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C is identical but not B: copy of B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical but not C: copy of C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical but not A: copy of A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>

<seg id="2389">You can either perform the just selected entry (file or odds), or all entries at once. if you have selected all interrodent actions (also in all subjects) you can start the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you have no target folder, then in the three-folder merge mode C is used as a target, in the two-folder sequence B is chosen as target and synchronize A and / or B as target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a target folder, please check whether all entries should be displayed in the target folder, even in the file size, there may be some options due to specific entries. check these options for unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select directory entry / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the scanning root). to add just the current entry, select action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If due to contradictory file types still exist, a message appears to be printed on the defective items. you can then select a valid promotion for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">If you merge all entries, a dialog window will appear with the options that simulate and break simulations.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Choose Simulate if you want to see what would happen, without changing the really changes. you will then receive a detailed list of all the actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then certain actions with all the entries needed. if a manual procedure is necessary (merge a single file), then a merge window will open (please note the screenshot).</seg>

<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3; on an error, message appears and detailed status information. at the end of the list you will see some error messages which you should help to skip the cause of problem. so you have the option to select another promotion for the entry, or to solve the problem in any way before using the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries were merged individually, please note & kdiff3; these entries are not yet recorded in the current session. even if it has been taken up, these entries will be considered. only if you do not change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The settings menu of & kdiff3; (menu settings - &gt; Kdiff3...) now has a section called directory interaction with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that are displayed on the displayed pattern are displayed in the element tree. separate the samples with a semicolon;. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default file is not equal to this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders corresponding to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered into the element tree, use the Semicolon; as a separator sign. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. preset is * .original; * .O.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders corresponding to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered into the element tree, use the Semicolon; as a separator sign. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. preset is * .original; * .O.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that are also ignored by CVS. many autmatory produced files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this folder can be set with a .cvsignore file. (see below info: / cvs / cvsignals.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file system files have a leading point. in other file systems selected a leading point. this option lets you decide whether these files are displayed in the element tree or not. this option is enabled in the default component.</seg>
<seg id="2406">Links to files: if the option is switched, symbolic shortcuts are compared. if the option is turned on, the files will be compared to which the links are deactivated. this is deactivated in the presetting.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Links to folder: if the option is switched, the links are compared to normal folders. (note that & kdiff3; please note that & kdiff3; please note to a folder of a link itself would lead to an end loop and & kdiff3; crashes off.) This option is shut down in the presetting.</seg>
<seg id="2408">This is a complete analysis of each file through and displays the statistics columns. (the number dissolved, invents, non-white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower if it is applied to files that does not contain any text. (enter an appropriate anti-pattern).</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare a large folder through a slow network, it may be easier to compare only the change date and file size. however, this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security. please use the default option.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the change date. there is no real comparison taking place. the files are considered to be equally large. this option may be useful if the change of change has lost. please use caution. this option is used in the default value.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activates the sync mode when two folders are compared and no target folder was specified. in this mode, the suggestions have been selected so that both folders are identical. also the results of the merge files are stored in both folders. this option is shut down in the presetting.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, the copying of the newer file is proposed as a action. (this is considered unsafably, because the other file does not change the other file.) This option is shut down in any case.) This option is shut down in the presetting.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or a folder will be replaced or deleted, the original version is renamed and gets the extension .original. if an old backup file is already exists, this will also be deleted without further backup. this option also affects the merge all the file. this option is switched on in the presetting.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the folder sequence View would remain visible in the merge of individual files; you can switch the window divider with the mouse. if you don't want to switch the window directory and text window, you can switch the window directory and text windows to switch between the window and text window between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably, you prefer to compare a file simply by double clicking. however, you can use a single file directly connected directly without the folder. as soon as you can save the folder, the status will be done again and the file will not start again when you start the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status is lost, if you re-read the directory again: directory - menu: re-read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. Kdiff3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way you can specify files and folders to open, which are located on local or remote computers.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax for local files and folders. some things you should note:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relatively being. or.. included. that's not possible with URLs, these are always absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, spaces &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file with the name / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the file system on the server, sometimes by the protocol used. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it can not be distinguished whether a link is displayed on a file or folder. then a file is accepted as a link goal. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no possibility to edit permission or change of change. (note that the permissions or change of change from the original.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose of main purposes is currently as differences viewer in KDevelop. KDevelop starts to start the built-in differences viewer. to start Kdiff3, press the right mouse button on the differences viewer and then select In Kdiff3Part view from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally you need & kdiff3; two complete input files. if it is used as a Kpart, adopts & kdiff3; the names of the original files from the Patch-File. at least one of the two files must exist. then, & kdiff3 must recover the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Konqueror, you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu. please note that this does not work if any of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable when the original files have changed since generation of Patch-file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiff3; when Part is executed, there is only the same of two files, a very small toolbar and menu. the merge or the same file size is not supported in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (well-it commissions) is already available. furthermore, the name Kdiff3 indicates that there is diffuse as the program diff3 from the Diff Tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have been using GPL programs already very long and have learned much in the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all the programmers passed this way or go it way.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You have already compiled the program from the sources and configure the correct prefix to KDE. in default, KDE will not find resources for user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file, you will find more information about this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are covered as identical; but if only a non-white character is different, the line will not be identical as it is not identical. if it is not identical, this is the next to Each Teris, but this is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor will notice for each difference in the files where it begins and ends. this is necessary to solve one conflict simply by clicking in the source text and select the result simply as text file and it is too much effort to create extra a separate file format that could save this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort has been too large so far. you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C. to process large quantities of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing the text is suddenly lt; no src left; appeared and the text can't be clear. what does this mean and how can this be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; used many colors to increase sub-differences. even more highlighting would be confusing and concealed the purpose. please use a different editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and error reports arrived from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all the functions of & kdiff3; you need & kde; 3.1 or later.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information about how to use KDiff3 on any platform without KDE you can find on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of recent changes can be found under http: / / diff3.sourceforge.net / Changelog or in the Changelog file in the Quell package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install-diff3; compile and install on a system with & kde; use the following command in the base folder of & kdiff3; -Distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE files will be the folder in your system, installed in the KDE. if you are unsafe, you will find more details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Da & kdiff3; autoconf and automake should not be used to compile any problems when compiling. should you still appear in trouble, please report on the & kde; -mail lists of it.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Umschalt-Remove) copies in the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or envelopes) add text from the clipboard to the current cursor position and replaces the current selection.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only differences: files that are identical in all folders can not appear in the folder, and therefore not in the target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in current program version you need to read the folder to these options using the function actualization.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">Only entries are displayed, the differences are indicated that identical files are not already copied to the target folder. if the target folder does not already contain these files, they are missing after the merge. (the behaviour is likely to change in a later program version.) This option is shut down in the presetting.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to choose from the source with the label A, B and C below the menu bar. if you have attached to one of the buttons, the lines are attached to the end of the selected group (if they are not already available). if the lines are already available, click on the button again automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In the default option this option is deactivated. underdifferences in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated like differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & kpager; shows a miniature show of all virtual workspace. it is quite practical to change the current programs on the workspace, to change their size or move it. this works both within a desktop and several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & kpager; can display all virtual work areas as well as those of the current applications. the applications can be selected and can be moved even on the desktop and in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button window can be moved within & kpager; the movement is possible both within a desktop and other work spaces.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: if on the empty background of & kpager; if, if you click on an application within & kpager; if, in addition, the icon and the name of the application also appear to maximize, maximize, in mind and finish. commands are the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the use window for the full size of the desktop. appears only if I clicked on a application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Send the application to selected virtual desktop. appears only if I clicked on a application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is marked, window can be moved inside & kpager; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and can also be moved to other work areas.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is crossed, in & kpager, the names of virtual working areas are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Crossing this field leaves the & kpager to view the numbers of virtual working areas. it is equipped together with names, the names will be ordained, & eg; 1. mind.</seg>
<seg id="2459">When this field is crossed, the background of each desktop will also be shown as a background in & kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">When this field is crossed, the current programs are shown as a small window in the & kpager; otherwise only the empty workspace will be shown to make their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here is the view of the program window. simply shows simple rectangle with the proportions of the program window. symbol shows the window with its standard symbol and Pixmap shows a small view of actual program window. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & kpager; main window can be determined: classic and kpager; in a 2xn-grid, how out of Pager-applications appear in some other windows; horizontally shows all virtual working areas in a horizontal row, which is very good for the display side on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager miniature program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size to display the window as symbols or with their content. furthermore, he runs outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Click the right mouse button within & kpager; and subsequent alignment of switching switch... lets the dialog box appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">At the moment, the settings can't be changed in the settings, but you can do it manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / config / kpagerrc with any text editor like e.g. & kedit; or else. if you have no write permission for the file, you have to register your system administrator or to assign to your system administrator. in this file, you have to present the key windower mode and assign it to this value. possible values are:</seg>
<seg id="2467">Da & kpager; part of the package is, you need a working installation of the KDE key packages.</seg>

<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain, which arises during clicking the mouse, and helps many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, you suffer pain, who are associated with the use of your computer, should consult a doctor if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To make it clear: even if & kmousetool; pain helps with the mouse, it is against pain caused by clicking the mouse, useless. and as in all ergonomic support tools, the result can vary for each different.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click once you turn off the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2502">Is the intelligent shift activates, makes & kmousetool; a break after pressing the mouse button. move the mouse to run with the mouse button. this way you can perform the pulling on the mouse button. the intelligent move requires a little exercise, but you get used quickly.</seg>

<seg id="2511">First, you should be aware of which places a mouse click without effect: clicking on the neutral production of windows or on places in browser window, which cannot represent free reactions. you can use the mouse on such places until you want to use it again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">If your mouse is printed, you should clean your mouse. it is normally pretty easy. the trick is very easy to clean the mouse, but also the rolls that come with the mouse ball in touch.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you need to remove the mouse ball. as it happens, is from mouse to mouse. it should be clear when you see the underside of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the rolls. these are located on the sides of the hole in which the sphere was used. dirt and dirt is easily scrapped with a flat blade or the fingers.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system opens the execution of & kmousetool; when you use the intelligent shifting system, meaning that & kmousetool means that operation cannot stop using the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use a window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem exists that you own a mouse click. in this way the status of & kmousetool will be reset, and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to execute mouse clicks and sets the cursor into a different place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor into place where you want to make it. however, if you don't want to bring your mouse on a neutral area of your desktop, if you don't want to bring out the mouse on a neutral reactions. secure zones for the mouse pointer is & eg. secure zones for the mouse pointer and menus and the cover lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I tried to work with intelligent shifts but I don't create it to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent shifting is a advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes its time to circumnavigate to this text, to copy it into the clipboard, if you want to move it into the clipboard, if you want to move the mouse when you want to move with the mouse button. however, there will probably be some problems again. here are some advice about it:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the intelligent shift if you just start with & kmousetool; select text instead as follows: take a mouse click at the end of the text area, while you move the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and once again the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. in this way, when & kmousetool will play a sound like a mouse click. so you know exactly when using an intelligent shifting. later, you can use the intelligent shifting also without the audible mouse click. but it needs some exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool; use the XTest extension for & X Window; installed, that should be the case in most system.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and loud speaker.</seg>

<seg id="2728">Here you can view the prosy filter filter. when the first start of & ktops is automatically set up. you can change its settings, or add additional satin-borders filters, but the inexhausting is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2729">At the easiest you will learn to setup the device selection from and enter text to the device. switch on the card selection once again, change some features and check how the selections select. for this purpose, you have to set up more than a speaker, otherwise the filter is invalid.</seg>

<seg id="2731">You can then stop text orders on the card card or break, even if the voice synthesis of this function does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons the normal set-level filter is automatically set up when you start at mgr for the first time. it cannot be removed only. do not change anything at this filter unless you know what you do.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Compare the text with a regular expression for propositional and add a table sign (decimal code 8) to the set limits (decimal number 8). note that the default buffer filter is automatically removed from the text.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD Filter will never be applied on & kde; -News (kJ), warnings, messages or the output of Screen-reagents.</seg>

<seg id="2740">Choose the characteristics of the desired speaker. if this feature doesn't matter, you will give nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Check this check box when the property will have priority ahead of other features. you can also set several markings on this box.</seg>
<seg id="2742">As the language is a critical factor when the output is, it will always be treated as a priority feature. the only case if you possibly want to specify the attribute language, if you know that a certain application text in another language as the number introduced in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all the features in the area, use the most likely to be clear, click on the select knob standard speaker and then apply on spokesperson who is the most likely to the following.</seg>

<seg id="2751">On the map audio card there is a setting speed. so that this works, the program SOX installed and can be found on the environment variable PATH. some Synthesis modulus like Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed. depending on the chosen voice, it is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for the microphone speed are ignored when & ktts; & HTML; (this is that the HTML code will be converted into SSML.) Deactivate either the filter for the conversion of & HTML; (see) or if you are very courageous, change the .xyz file of & HTML; -after-SSML-ROM, and set up the microphone speed.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I don't create that websites with a female voice will be read. I have created a female Festival spokesperson, but & ktops; read the websites with a male voice.</seg>

<seg id="2836">For this case, the installation of Qt and & kde; not, but also the development packages with libraries and other things are needed.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; the following commands should afford this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic network technology will be discussed in the second, all by & knetworkconf; alterable configuration files are discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This area can't replace more information about IP networks. in this appendix only basic information on the integration of the PC is conveyed into a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">At present, IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv4 is not expected to spread much spread. from IPv6 it is expected to continue in the near future. this description is therefore concentrated on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is the knowledge that the IP address of a network interface is due. in foreign networks, at & eg; workplace is the network administrators to the contact address, which can be a valid IP address, if available, the IP address can not be selected as desired!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up an own small (home) network, the IP address should be chosen for this purpose to avoid IP address options using the global network (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded to the Internet, therefore its any use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course you can access the Internet for such machines by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks most addresses are used in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the power mask is usually set to 255.255.255.0 so that all computers are connected in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second the loopback address (localhost = the own computer). the default route is needed for the IP address.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The 127.0.0.1 network address is reserved for the IP traffic in your own machine. usually the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to an own so-called loopback interface, which works as a closed circle.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& dat; is a program for tape drives on the basis of tar. it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on one tape. the first goal was to create a surface for tar, which presented the ability of dds2tar for quick, selective outpack. the second purpose was the answer of a question that my wife set: how much longer lasts when you secures?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used, it must be mounted by & cdat; it can happen in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& dat; dented the band back and reads the prestressing of the tape. detects & cdat; the precancer on the band will not be asked if the band is being formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Recognise & dat; the case is looking for the suitable index on your disk. can this not be found, you'll be asked if the Bandindex should be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">Everything has been smooth, changing the icon for the tape drive to indicate that the tape was built. in the status bar a corresponding message appears. the contents of the tape can now be searched for the band.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Prior to the expiration of the banker, first the entry must first be solved. there are three methods to make this one-digit:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& dat; there is a modification of the symbol for the tape that the connection for the tape was solved and shows a corresponding message in the Status Bar. the band can now be cast out without any danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a volume of & cdat is used, it must be formatted by & dat; formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band-species must be formatted before you can use a tape before use. if your band has to be formatted, this process requires that a tape can be formatted before use. the floppy disk drives cannot be formatted before using the tape image. floppy disk drives usually use a formatting of the belt ahead, DAT drives on the other hand.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band called and the capacity goes & cdat; with the formatting of the band. all the data on the tape are lost! after completion of the end process the band is automatically embedded and is ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you encounter the backup procedure, you need to select the secured files. that can happen on three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Choose a file or folder in the local file tree. only this file or folders can be secured.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a backing profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile are secured.</seg>
<seg id="2906">In local file tree, mark files in a local file tree. only the selected files and / or sub-folders are secured.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and choose from the backing menu...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup redirected, the dialog for backup. in this dialogue, you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">When you confirm the settings, the dialog appears to backup. the dialog shows the progress of the securing process, including data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archive for the drive. only the selected file or folder is checked.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archive for the band using a hammers. only the selected files and / or sub-folders are checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Click on the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the test procedure started, the dialog for checking. in this dialogue, you can check out your selection and change the working folder for review.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you confirm the settings for check, the dialog appears to verify that this dialog shows the progress of the test process and data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can use the restore, the files that are to be recovered can be marked, which can be selected in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives created for the tape drive. only the selected file or folder will be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files from one of the archives with a hammers. only the selected files and / or sub-folders are recovered.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Click with the right mouse button on a file or folder in one of the archives and select in the menu recovery....</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the recovery procedure started, the dialog for Restoration. in this dialogue, you can check your selection once again and change the working folder for recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">If you have confirmed the settings for restoration, the dialog appears again. this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process and data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it is necessary to rebuild the band indexed file using the band content. this process deletes all existing index files for this band. you can use the index to two types of the tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This ensures a backing profile with the straight marked files and default settings. you can set the following settings for a secure profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder in which the backup should be carried out. the list of the files will be automatically updated according to the just chosen work folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders that are listed under backup files, only those files which are listed on the same file system, as the folder. folders that are on other file systems, you can find separately under backup files. each entry will be viewed by tar regardless of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files have changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file, which is used for determination of changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before the call of tar. this causes all files to be secured and created a new snapshot file for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of buttons files & gt; lt; and lt; files was not completely implemented at the time of compilation of this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set up the settings via the menu item... in the Settings menu. the following settings can be done:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path for the device module for tape drive (usually / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-rewinding variation of the belt.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Is this setting active, transmitted & cdat; before the band is connected to the drive. in some drives this is necessary before read or write operations.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Is the option switched on, try & cdat; to lock the design of the tape drive. possibly this setting will not work on all banddrives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is turned on, the tape can be activated automatically when loosing & cdat; automatically use the tape. do not use this option at Floppy Streamers.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Is the option switched on, tries & cdat; the hardstanding block size for tape drive. no matter whether this setting is active or not, you need & cdat; in any case the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a tape is formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only prove a memory block on the tape. the content of the file is composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(N Byte) The volume ID. the format of this character set is the host name: seconds, whereby the host name is the full name of the system has been formatted on which the tape has been formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that has been formatted since the epoch in which the band has been formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $HOME / .kdat file.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are pure tar-archives that can be managed directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as it is no incremental fuses.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a backup tape. this symbol is only active if a tape is mounted.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& Clean Systems log; is a & kde; viewer for system protocols. the program is for inexperienced users who can't know where you can get information about your system or where the system allows the different protocol log; experienced users with fast access to the example of information on your server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& Clean Systems log; helps users to understand what your computer makes in the background. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who can not know where you can receive information about your system or where the system is deposited into the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Furthermore allows the system log; experienced users with fast access for example on problems related to their server. & Clean Systems log; therefore attempts to provide some advanced functions, with their help the protocol-files will be filtered and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 and the system log, a series of useful features. these include among others:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and will be explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you see in the following screen photo shows & coaching log; functions are available, with which help the single protocol lines of a protocol file easily filtering and sort out. the individual possibilities for sorting and filters will be shown in the next chapter of this handbook.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start was trying to open the system log, first the most important protocol file of the system - the system log - will not be displayed, and it does not run with system administrators. the protocol files usually find under Linux normally in the folder / var / log, for the normal user usually have no permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter according to a selected filter indication. the list of the log files will now automatically be displayed, so that only protocol box contains the entry to the selected filter. in the default setting, a protocol line contains only displayed if in one of the columns the string range of the filter search is included.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry in this spot. the string of the filter search term will then only be chosen with entries in the selected column protocol. in addition, select the system log in the name of a trial, so will show you & coaching log; all protocol lines are sent or compiled by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is activated in the default settings and helps you recognize the key protocol lines. protocol lines of the level error are displayed using a striking colour as a protocol-line accuracy. the colour representation of protocol lines can be switched on dialog dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Would you only show a specific process (e.g. in the system log or in cron protocol), so you can check process identification (PID) in the column process. this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a particular command as for example to the start of the Samba server. in this case, use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can jump the option to new lines in the context menu of the main window to view all new added protocol lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& Clean Systems log; allows you to open multiple protocol files in separate subwindows. to open this feature, use the entries in the menu windows to open additional subpane and manage. once you select a window, select a protocol to display.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& Clean Systems log; has its own website on http: / / ksSystems log.forum-software tware.org Dort you will find further current information about the supply of supply systems.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& the system log, you can also find in the following folder of & kde; Subversion Archive: kssystem log; in & kde; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather well known (and in the following also called) as & ksysv; this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv;</seg>
<seg id="2957">The system V Init develops quickly to the standard for control of the program system in the & Linux; world. therefore, because it is easier to use, more powerful and more flexible than the traditional BSD-init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go on historical aspects here (for example, because I don't know about it: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The Init binfile is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because someone could try to make a machine on system V Init without a new installation and re-format. this is why you need to ensure that the old init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SYSV Init also differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files in a sub-folder of / etc are instead of directly in / etc. this file is called rc.d. Dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot scripts. basically, you need to launch a script for each system service, which you want to change to another runlevel. system services include such things such as network, NFS, & senmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things like setserial that will only start once. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should lie down under / etc / rc.d if you require it. most systems have this file, even if it is actually not much use. you can also leave a rc.serial / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial connection to do with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is looking for different places after the program init and starts the first one finds it.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard margin is listed in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point, you can cast a look into the second column and probably notice that the default portable runlevel 3 is. if you want to change it, then you can upgrade to the inittab. if you have something different, then you will get it to reboot the system and run the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how do we get all the right scripts? if you enter l -l in rc3.d, you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no right files in this file. instead, every entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does it start and stop system services? very simple: each of the scripts is written so that it accepts an argument like start and stop. you can actually start this scripts like by hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would read the httpd server. it reads the name, and if the K includes the argument, the script will stop using the argument stop. if it includes an S, the script will be called with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want a simple way to set machines for many purposes. I could have & eg; a server running level, that can only run httpd, & senmail;, network & etc., I also could have a user -Runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn the use of & ksysv; you should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another hand device is simple to say not trivial: simply drag an entry out of the available system services to one of the six round level to start on this level (or stop using this level).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can move the scripts between Runleveling or change the position within one level by moving it anywhere else. this will not only happen if you go out an entry in the availability of the available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved when you go into a new range. in order to copy them to a new runlevel, you need to choose copying files from the menu or from the context menu -- even then if the same entry has already existed in the target range of the promotion.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorption number of an entry can sometimes be calculated. in such a case you have to edit the sorting numbers of the ambient entries before you can try to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: there are currently no possibility to restore entries that were thrown into the recycle bin. so be careful not.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab button to activate the various operating ranges (available system services, runlevel 1 Start, runlevel 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection of upper or below the previous ones.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another round level, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it into the desired runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To manually change the number or names of a single entry, press the dialog button to switch between different fields. connect the dialog by repeating the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the menu file require a confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. defaults to the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc). otherwise it will be produced by & ksysv; changes to the default settings are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have failed to experiment with the Standard Runleveling and now starts the machine resistant. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input key to start in a single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default margin to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>

<seg id="2985">If you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), then you need to edit additional files into / etc that are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way how system services are started in these distributions, but does not simplifies the configuration of the proprietary adjustments of these distributions, but unfortunately no standard. the authors of & ksysv; planning an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using a different distribution, please check whether all configuration files are needed (and also if they are in the proper directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache and httpd) terminate simply without message if its configuration files are not available or false.</seg>

<seg id="2994">The password file management appears if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd as well as in BSD-Unix.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card card appears only if you are activated and initialized on at least an embedded file system (Quota) and initialized (recognizable by the quota.user / quota.group on the file system). here, there may be parameters for each user, with space restrictions on the data contained in KB:</seg>
