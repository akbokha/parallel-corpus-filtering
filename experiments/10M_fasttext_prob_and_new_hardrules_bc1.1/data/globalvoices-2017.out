although I had visited the U.S. for at least once a year , I would now live for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my dear to America is extraordinary .
as many of my generation I grew up with American movies , I have read American writers and run American authors .
in fact , this country had a suff@@ iciently pro@@ found effect on me that I was mostly occupied by an American film journalist .
when I was 14 years old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a fear@@ less re@@ porter , who w@@ ed the mur@@ der@@ ous conspi@@ racy of a oil @-@ Magn@@ um , who wanted to lay his interest in the Supreme Court that had his interest .
I was prisoner .
free to Method You , &quot; I was it , as if it is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
and the year that I lived in Arizona , had only strengthened my ad@@ mir@@ ation for the USA .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country where I ever lived , whose variety is so inv@@ iting you can always be that you are and it is easy to find in a community of equal people .
I even had a very warm@@ est love chat about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about the x@@ en@@ op@@ ho@@ bia and the rac@@ ism of this man .
the most exceptional aspect of his asc@@ ension is for me , as it goes with its commitment .
he never stops behind the mountain , as it says so beautiful .
he says exactly what he think , as a former colleague it express , and publicly declared his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ amer@@ ican and women .
nevertheless , people have responded to his statements and approved in pairs for him .
the 13 million votes he won with the Republi@@ can Presi@@ dential elections , was the highest number ever recorded by the party .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ ote person , asked me ?
I could not bring Tr@@ ump and his voters in line with people who I learned during my time in Phoenix .
as for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program , people from around the world , a deep believ@@ ing man , with whom I could talk about Islam and his past .
the Tr@@ um@@ ps World illustrates not with the current publisher of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er , &quot; in agreement with the current editor of Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a .
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for Basketball and we spent many hours to view the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
Tr@@ um@@ ps Int@@ ol@@ er@@ ance is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity that I experienced in Sandy B@@ ahr , who f@@ ights for their lives for the environment , and their husband Dave , my host family who treated me like their son .
it is still suitable for the commitment of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , which helped me with much patience and suffering from my colleagues to acc@@ use us to the complexity of the American life .
then Andrew L@@ eck@@ ey , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , were my ment@@ ors who helped me much with my career .
these people and those by em@@ bo@@ died values deep@@ ened my love in America .
while Tr@@ ump is bound to nom@@ inate Republi@@ can presidential candidate , they gave me a stop and the counter@@ part to its limited vision of America .
however , it found out that they were the exception of rule .
on 8 November 2016 , more than 50 million Americans , mostly White , the presi@@ dency of a man , despite - or perhaps because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the strug@@ gles with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump , because they were either proclaimed his rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism , because they were prepared to over@@ see these things , almost the heart broke .
perhaps it is un@@ fair to describe the Tr@@ ump @-@ voters as a c@@ assi@@ sts .
those who arrange people said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is super@@ fic@@ i@@ ally and respec@@ t@@ less and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act on a different way and think .
it shows the people that their wor@@ ries and fears about h@@ ug@@ g@@ ish changes are not taken into account in their congregations .
could it be that these voters who are most white , voted for Tr@@ ump , because they would like to gain control over a country that disappointed it ?
in other words , they wanted to say that they are still important in this America ?
maybe might be .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ n@@ ick , who commented on the cruel decision to come down a man who look down with cont@@ emp@@ t on those who look differently than he .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( An@@ m ) . : as much as &quot; Re@@ jection of the White against all other Eth@@ ni@@ as , &quot; voc@@ abul@@ ary from white in playing on the white and whi@@ pl@@ ash , which means that great Van Jones called , did exactly what America made so great .
millions of people around the world estimate the American Ideal - regardless of the myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - what faith or background you can always have , America means everyone is welcome .
for this country chose to be the son of a Ken@@ ian@@ ers twice the son of a Ken@@ ian@@ ers , whose history , as he himself says , no@@ where else in the world would be possible .
with the election Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , however , there is a huge part of white America &apos;s promise and says : to hell with confusion , religion and all the term of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in the America after 9 / 11 the white man is alive again .
in all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the day of election .
on a rally for Hill@@ ary Clinton had Mr. Khan a word change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , have my son , captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; he asked Mr. Khan .
the crowd answered with a loud voice . &quot; no ! &quot;
&quot; could Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; ro@@ ar the amount .
&quot; did Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered them .
have A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they called them and their voices were loud .
&quot; would anyone who don &apos;t think is like you , a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a lon@@ ely and loud voice &quot; NE@@ IN . &quot;
Mr. Khan closed with the words : &quot; thanks be to Mr. Tr@@ ump , this is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was con@@ ferred .
the land , for which his son was , sent him a message .
this is now Tr@@ um@@ ps Land , said the news .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could no place there in this new America .
and that breaks me my heart .

out of the Als@@ ace to the stars : these Latin American children do not leave their love to music by rub@@ b@@ ish .

what did the Mexican music school of the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero municipality in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the kids of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean city of Cat@@ e@@ ura ?
that the music , which is played in both places , does not only change the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is situated on the outskirts of a large land@@ fill , only 16 kilometres south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; a old colonial city which is very popular among the tourists , but the worlds away from the nearby pre@@ stige ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for some years now La B@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( Music ban@@ de ) has been playing in the municipality : one from children and adults , existing symph@@ ony orchestra , which with their musical instruments have found a way to over@@ coming the surrounding poverty .
a music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the community of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the church , which is located in one of the p@@ oo@@ rest provinces of Mexico , is known for its drug abuse and the bonds of bonds .
but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth had always offered a rare hope .
the young band members take their obligations towards the music group , the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI writes :
as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
they will always come and play with shining eyes and play in the Tru@@ bel you are studying day for day trumpet , tromb@@ one , Pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ ber@@ os and the Con@@ ga .
music from W@@ aste
more than 7.000 kilometres south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero to play the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village that is practically above at the biggest gar@@ bage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in the capital - on instruments made from recovered waste material :
music with recovered instruments , made from local solid waste materials , manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura , where the recycling started under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Chávez in order to transform parts of the exhaust in instruments .
the instruments im@@ itate violin , viol@@ as , c@@ elli , double b@@ asses , gu@@ itars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trumpets , tromb@@ ones and percussion that were all made out of the tr@@ ash .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music and music by the Beatles , from Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article in the Los Angeles Times F@@ avi@@ o Chávez reminds of a local econom@@ ist and music teacher of the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura , at the initial time :
first it was very difficult because we had no place for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach in the same place , the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents , because many of them do not live with their children .
this changed slightly as F@@ avi@@ o , which he had never seen before : a violin made of waste .
today , there is a whole orchestra that plays on instruments from recovered material and is called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
a documentary N@@ ames &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic gar@@ bage dump ) shows the musical performance :
the world produces approximately one billion tonnes of waste each year .
those who live with him and of him are the p@@ oo@@ rest , like men in Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn him into something beautiful .
the Orchestra harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspir@@ ing spectac@@ le of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra played his music even before Pope Francis :
these Eastern African countries show how technology and team@@ work can successfully fight the illegal fishing
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that is fighting the wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published in En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically advised about international , practic@@ ed solutions for environmental problems .
the re @-@ publication happens in the context of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for common use of content .
it was then known in West Africa that this ship had already operated illegal fishing boats before the other coast of Africa had already visited Africa .
the Eastern African countries were con@@ fron@@ ted in accordingly and inclined to hot the cr@@ ush@@ ers of this type to their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ essors , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and Seych@@ elles , mobil@@ ized quickly against the ship . they refused to attack one of its har@@ bours and refused to share a fishing stone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the Premier was surrounded by countries , who simply refused to be refused , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior executive of the Ken@@ yan fishing industry . he is part of a team that discovered the ship of the ship and persecuted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was driven out of the region &apos;s waters : it was not able to catch up there fish .
finally , it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , due to pill@@ age of the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , the criminal practices crossed and resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries which stop from N@@ RO Stop illeg@@ ally F@@ ishing ( Il@@ legal Fish@@ eries ) .
the members of this network are adjacent to Somalia and Madagascar , the six countries that then drove the Premier from their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries which are equ@@ alled and work together . you can exchange information and stand on each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , Head of the P@@ ew Char@@ ly Tru@@ sts project En@@ ding . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is regulated by defin@@ itive : what is caught , is hidden from being extremely difficult to split . thereby , the illegal fishing is a main cause of over@@ fishing regions .
by the deliber@@ ation of existing laws , by which certain hab@@ itats and species are protected , the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystem may harm a del@@ ic@@ ate equilibrium .
however , during the actions against the illegal fishing were once im@@ pregn@@ ated through bureau@@ cr@@ atic hur@@ d@@ les , and with the information between individual countries , these actions are now in real time , with tra@@ ce@@ able on F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communications platform .
there , for example , the individual countries can exchange the lists of existing lic@@ ences , news about their own activities or details that one had noticed or experienced during a port spec@@ tion .
fish @-@ i pursued the activities of ships even very atten@@ tive if they move on the open sea , via satellite data .
this enables the authorities to mark ships to mark the ships of fishing in forbidden areas - such as such that a ship suggest that a ship loads his caught fish on the way to other ships .
in ide@@ cases , such investigations can indicate whether the involved ships have a fishing license , where they were on the road and possibly even if they have a stra@@ com@@ est .
countries that are against illegal fishing , may be able to refuse the assum@@ ption of such vessels in their ports . what means that the ships could not sell their charge . and that they could even be forced to the numbers of pen@@ alties , as in the case of the Premier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then there is considerable financial losses for the owners , which means that the illegal fishing catch is fin@@ anci@@ ally worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that &apos;s what we want to reach , &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , leading director of NF@@ DS Africa . the latter is a celebr@@ ity company that sets itself for the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i .
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created , in order to win estimated $ 20 million to lost sales , representing eight members of the H@@ ISH network every year due to the illegal f@@ ishers who penet@@ rate in Eastern African waters .
East Africa is one of the most productive t@@ una fish fish@@ eries , which is due to the region &apos;s commercial fishing from all over the world . among these illegal f@@ ishers .
among their practices include actions such as sailing under false flag , f@@ ake licens@@ ing papers , speci@@ fying imag@@ ery species , fishing protected species and fish in nature conservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ut@@ ili@@ ze the missing international cooperation and do the weak@@ nesses of an un@@ stable control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ship was illegal and a country could say &apos; You must not run my harbour . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; and exactly this legal sli@@ p@@ hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i now .
the closed front has been completed .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 studies of susp@@ ects ships .
it has uncovered the criminal network that had counter@@ f@@ eit licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several fr@@ au@@ dul@@ ent ident@@ ities used and it has been pursued and found ships .
due to its collaboration with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority for the com@@ b@@ ating of crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information about illegal fishing across large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our resear@@ ches lead us far into the networks of organiz@@ ational crimes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it builds a system that can help F@@ ISH @-@ i to be di@@ gest with precise ships .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system that has always been developed further , helps to hide the illegal ships to hide themselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; illegal f@@ ishers use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chief analy@@ st with Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tra@@ cking , a N@@ RO , which also offers technical support with fish@@ eries and fishing industry .
some of the ships switch for example their automatic identification systems where they can no longer be used by satellite .
Cop@@ eland therefore helps to build a system that combines different information carriers . the F@@ ISH @-@ i will help to find criminal ships with greater precision .
a program model
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of afri@@ can nations actually take effect on the und@@ ou@@ bt@@ edly global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the platform Global F@@ ishing Watch on Google and the Oc@@ e@@ ana Marine protection organization : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide through the position of any tra@@ ce@@ able ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; met with the neighbours to get a better picture of it , who does whatever - this makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to un@@ ite and to bund@@ le their resources . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should do this on global level . &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ ly Tru@@ sts has a similar project when a global system permits the persecution of ships .
there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities do not only feel famous det@@ ective stories , but also scre@@ ams .
ships that previously used without license f@@ ished and hardly to reck@@ on with consequences we know that they are observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH @-@ i have now reached a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries , ever since fishing boats more licenses .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found there on board towing networks , whose use is prohibited .
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
other countries consider these successes . &quot; the effect is so strong that we also copy other countries , &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; we have become a study object . &quot; in West Africa , &quot; we dis@@ appearing several hundred million dollars annually through illegal fishing .
there are six countries assembled in 2015 , to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . now , they fight the illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security is the goal of leaving more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s most recent member of Somalia was able to report its first great triumph : in October there were Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was under false flag . not only was the ship travelling without a license and were not allowed to be forbidden .
the ship was also reserved in forbidden waters , which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; with the rules of rules against Gre@@ ko 1 , it was a strong sign that they should go against illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ ISH @-@ i , this is another success of many . and at the same time , evidence shows that such special , collab@@ orative work will actually work in the entire world . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London . she writes about the environment , technology and nutrition .
her article will appear in Wi@@ red Magazine , T@@ ED Education , the New York Times , and in the Guardian . situation in Venezuela has sp@@ elled on : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of bringing &quot; the country . &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of intense demonstrations .
they apply to protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the President of Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

after the government of Venezuela was rejected by the opposition to a referendum on a referendum , the Ven@@ z@@ ol@@ ans re@@ acted , in whose eyes the negotiations began to lead over the political and economic crisis of the country , in which they were gathered to the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the recovery of Venezuela ) can be found both images of this demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them .
the debate will also lead in other parts of the country - amongst others in the low@@ lands of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ den@@ regions Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , in the central north of the federal state of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ part@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country deterior@@ ates continuously , which in everyday life of the Ven@@ z@@ ol@@ ans is noticeable by a acute lack of food and medicines .
many representatives of the opposition saw in the minist@@ ration of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro has chance for a fundamental change ; finally , however , the re@@ election of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ acting at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises in its latest article the context of government decree as follows :
in the context of the social , political and economic crisis , the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % at the annual financial statements , and in which a serious and extensive lack of food and medicine is the only way to give the country the chance to re@@ locate its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .

the call was commented on Twitter as follows :

the first demonstration in the context of the action programme &quot; The recovery of Venezuela &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26th October .

particularly large waves beat the message about police repression at the centrally located city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there , demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own statement before the police and armed forces of government .
hours later , they were able to leave the cathedral again , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to retain police forces , including those women in the An@@ den@@ State T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira bear no coats , because otherwise it could see what many national@@ ists did not have !
meanwhile , an inf@@ ographic on the round , which forms the extent of suppression of repression per day :
thus the dictatorship has op@@ pressed the country .
many representatives of the government had the validity of the demand after a minist@@ ration procedure - this was now shown in the eyes of many through the presence of inn@@ um@@ erable people in the streets .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Labs :
Nicol@@ ás and di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of the signatures are counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ed .
here is your ministers !
on the road !
other values of this protests as a further step in the fight against a government that made little against the devastating economic crisis and would prefer to kill critical voices :
they have taken us so much - but also the fear !
mar@@ ches do always take more of frequency and intensity .
some Ven@@ z@@ ol@@ ans reported the media to be hungry to take part in a strike , rather than to work or shopping .

this is an adap@@ tive version of a interviews from Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano , whose original is being published on 23 August 2016 on D@@ ía a D@@ ía , a Argentin@@ ean news page .
the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano became forced by his father to see the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in Argentina &apos;s Argentine city Córdoba .
as an adult man , Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano said in the context of the large La Per@@ la @-@ Ribera process in the province of Córdoba against his father .
in the trial which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes was examined , who were committed during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
starting with the office , the same name as his father bear up to the brutal military operations in the prison La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he has suffered enough .
he kept the family secret for 34 years .
in the situation at that time , I thought that was in order .
I felt like a secret .
as a child with 15 years you don &apos;t notice that one is manip@@ ulated by his father .
I could not know that my father was a thief , fol@@ ly and mur@@ der@@ ers .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ ar@@ eri@@ e@@ Invest@@ ter . during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , his father was deputy commander of the Intelligence officer 141 in the prison of La Per@@ la .

this is not the story of Luis Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ pressed , who is charged with ab@@ duction in 158 cases , torture , murder in nearly 100 cases and kidn@@ apping of a 10 year old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qu@@ i@@ j@@ anos Son , a man who did in the years the extent of the atro@@ cities , which he had witnessed in the years before a Federal Court against his own father .
his story shows what great power has a parent over his child , and how this child chose for himself a way of redemption .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father began to take me to the military base , I went often with us to the sports hall . there I had been killed with a boy , the mar@@ tial sport .
all they called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo , and asked me to identify my friend on it .
he said :
you are a wat@@ erh@@ ole , you were killed with one of the ERP .
pass just that they will not lead you out of a day , and I will save you .
ab@@ brevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito revolutions in Pueb@@ lo , the Revolutionary People &apos;s Army , the military arm of the Revolutionary Workers Party in Argentina .
therefore he for@@ bid me to go back into the gym . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he said to me , I would become secret .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that was in order . for so my father had moved me .
on the military base I had to destroy pap@@ ers who had heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : University conclu@@ des , handwritten notes , literature , certificates , prop@@ aganda material , books , just everything .

&apos;@@ da@@ zzle the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
my father took me four times after La Per@@ la , all in 1976 .
at the first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ ac@@ ke , in the cars , furniture , television , fri@@ dges - just all possible - all possible .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a little in a blan@@ ket , and commanded me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that a large cl@@ ums@@ y was found in it .
on that day I went to the other end of the Bar@@ ac@@ ke where the stolen objects were removed and under@@ took me with a guard .
suddenly he interpreted to an open room and said :
there the prisoners tor@@ tured .
I saw in and saw a Lie@@ ge where people were tor@@ tured .
she looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that it fortified the end of a cable . the other end was fast@@ ened to the body of the person who was just there .
they caught a man with a hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , over@@ lay it with water and pursued him a charge of 220 volts to the gen@@ ital@@ ia .

the tank there was dr@@ y@@ able there ... as a dirty win@@ del .
years later , when my father arose under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room .
I recognized the smell again and I became clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I never forget this smell .
and I asked me , What is it possible that a man can do so much sorrow in one another ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I knew that these people were killed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when my father took me to work for the third time he took me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were sh@@ ackl@@ ed and tied .
he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; L@@ op@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pe@@ z , a civilians who was also indicted in the process ) and I took the opportunity to throw a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses , on which naked people with the face down below - all were spot@@ ted at hands and feet .
close to the entrance of the entrance to the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noticed that I saw to the cap@@ tives , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you think so , Ar@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I met &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why have you brought me nothing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were cast into a pit and was buried by soldiers .
I know that , because my father told me home .
besides La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms that were named as offices were called .
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero made a man there and killed one man .
according to the survi@@ vors of the civilian , Jorge Rom@@ ero is also indicted in the La Per@@ la @-@ Ribera ( to be found in the La Per@@ la @-@ Ribera ) .
in the following video , Emilio F@@ essi@@ a , the head of the Memorial La Per@@ la , through the former following chambers .
the way to which you came in , is also the way where they arrived here .
if you see on the map , see that they took about this way and then became tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number assigned to the process of discovery .
when they survived the acts of torture , the prisoners were thrown into cu@@ cum@@ ra , until the order of above came that they should be re@@ located .
this was the lie - the Eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of people and the dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; war yield &apos;
my father brought all the possible stolen things with home .
at that time , I had no idea about the &quot; war &quot; - as it was called it .
but when I was later on the military , I was in the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - it was clear to me that the yield is a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps Military Bad@@ ge which one has strug@@ gled to be enemy .

but if one goes into a house and the refrigerator , the record players , clothes , painting , money ... steal , then that is no war , but v@@ and@@ alism .
that is theft .
I always asked me as my father , the director of security forces , could join this v@@ and@@ alism .
I simply don &apos;t understand .
I was also officer in the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do this .
once he called me a crime and I answered : and thou , whom thou can@@ st upon the street ?
you are not a crime ?
he explo@@ ded me , he smote me , and cried , saying ,
if you go so far , then I will find you , and bring you strange .
we don &apos;t need any other !
so my father was .
I have no one good memory to him .
when I had said in the process , I showed a photo of then , on which I had a jacket and a bike swe@@ ater . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothing to home .
then , the defence asked me to have been a fellow in this crime . I said , no problem , they can lay me a burden , what they wanted .
I was anyway there to speak out .
&apos;@@ the dis@@ appearance of the dead is the last ab@@ b@@ ous act &quot;
now , where I am older , I &apos;m silent .
I have children . if you have only children , you can recognize the value of a life .
man develops and recogni@@ zes that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
so well , you have ex@@ er@@ ted during the dictatorship of human dictatorship . but what the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
why do children perform ?
one day my father brought a girl with home , whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I turned again the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
one would have it easy to put in jail .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people : but what the dead bodies disappear ?
did these people not have families who was handed over to their mort@@ al remains ?
the dis@@ appearance of the dead is the last ab@@ h@@ or act , which one can do to a man .
my father told me when the democracy was again introduced to eliminate the mort@@ al remains of the prisoner .
they were cr@@ ushed and somewhere there - no idea , where . &quot; one will never find something , &quot; said my father .
but anything remains , of course always .
&apos;@@ i have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
only to clear it : I have nothing against the military .
I even was with the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my father .
the thought that signi@@ fied my father arose during a meeting when he was under house arrest .
I did not trust in him because of all the atro@@ cities that I had to do with him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he said suddenly : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt un@@ fortun@@ ate and asked me , what was the whole of patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; who supp@@ os@@ edly defended it , actually well .
then I cried out :
how can you say anything to me ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crime , and you have comp@@ elled me as a child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he answered only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , I pray . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
exactly what did I do .
in 2010 , I announced the first display .
I finally knew that he was a crimin@@ als .
no one can submit to me that I have been losing for my own father . I finally told my own father .

a translation error makes older people in Kyoto to be &quot; terrible drivers &quot;
the sign with the translation errors in a center in Kyoto , in which one can extend his driving licence .
the photo was spread in the social media .
description of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of K@@ YO@@ U , customers of a newly opened Centre in which one can extend his driving licence in the last month of a very un@@ happy translation .
on a shield , the Japanese word ( a @-@ stri@@ pe sh@@ a ) , which means &quot; older drivers &quot; means , perhaps , perhaps with little rear ow@@ e &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; aw@@ able drivers &quot; translated .
the false translation was available on electronic ads from 1 to 20 September in the entrance area and in the building itself .
description of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was divided into the social media .
the error was the translator Julian Holmes , a population of Ky@@ ot@@ os , fell down . it was also , who made the local newspapers to the attention .
the daily Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n was published in Kyoto :
&quot; how could it come to an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation .
this is an ad@@ joining for elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto simply un@@ acceptable , &quot; Holmes &quot; said .
the faul@@ ty English translation was initially removed . the name &quot; -@@ drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; terrible drivers &quot; ) was later replaced by the reasonable name &quot; El@@ der drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) .
the police in the Kyoto pre@@ fecture were pre@@ school@@ ed for the translation errors . furthermore they declared that the error was already contained in the text that they had received from trans@@ lat@@ ors and that the translation was not checked for their correc@@ t@@ ness before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported how follows the exc@@ use :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry , he was sorry that elderly people were off@@ ended by the in@@ adequate correction ( translation ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News continued to learn more detailed with the phenomenon of the &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
the word &quot; terrible &quot; was disp@@ leased as an adequate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of elderly drivers who are involved in accidents are involved , but they are all concerned .
in the Kyoto Pre@@ fecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 were caused by a total of 19.@@ 460 accidents by seniors in 2005 , which equ@@ ates to a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , Sen@@ iors 1,@@ 8@@ 03 from a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents were incur@@ red .
this increased its share to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has fallen in total , the proportion of seniors caused injuries in the same period .
the nam@@ ing not mentioned re@@ porter published in Yahoo published version of the article comments on the light which show a few Japanese apparently some Japanese drivers :
the article on Yahoo Over the translation errors received the following comments :
&quot; is this ( &quot; fear@@ ful drivers &quot; ) not the reality ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the translation really not , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it is a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is spread throughout Asia .
translation errors are widespread in Japan and all Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a true story mine for these bizar@@ re bugs in English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r users Andrew .
the reasons for the wide distribution of translation were multi@@ fac@@ eted .
you need two important features : passive voice knowledge to understand the output text and active speech knowledge in order to transmit it into the target language .
the latter requires active rule of the target language - Som@@ e@@ thing that is in case of native speakers . generally , in general , the convic@@ tion that the trans@@ lat@@ ors in the target language - not in the output language - native language should be .
thus a French mother tongue was to transl@@ ate from English into French - not from the French to English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ users Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies employ no employees with English as native language , the translations into English . this might lack the lack of understanding , cost @-@ reasons or the relatively small number of English speakers , which can learn Japanese .
some companies that have no foreign employees allow translations to fir@@ ing internally . then the Japanese company , whose English knowledge is considered to be the best , for trans@@ lat@@ ors - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ users Karl Baron .
mechanical translations are also widespread - often with funny results .
the wor@@ r@@ ens and aw@@ ful phr@@ ases that are created by mechan@@ ized translations , show that this technique can still be no human trans@@ lat@@ ors for a long time . this is true for several languages .
some of the stran@@ gest English For@@ cour@@ ages in Japan , including the aw@@ k@@ ful im@@ prints that are often used t @-@ shirts or bags are only used for sty@@ li@@ istic reasons - not being read or understood .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors like jewelry nor un@@ acceptable , or at least harm@@ less . but by large companies or from the government who have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations .
the city of K@@ YO@@ TO also uses a serious source of translations in the future .
Venezuela : protests and TV to take action on the internet and television
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to PRE@@ N@@ SA y Soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute of Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , the 7th of April , Venezuel@@ an Internet use that they did not have access to the online transmitter vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later that other users wrote that the Internet plans of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV will not be accessible even more accessible .
another online radio records carried out images of the protests in Caracas , which were organized by op@@ positi@@ onal groups , who opposed the government of Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros .
the protests began early April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the tasks of Parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author of Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection is coupled to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the internet .
# Zen@@ o : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet sites are again closed .
this is from the site of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular in vene@@ ers with internet access , especially in times of distur@@ ban@@ ces .
traditional media have been working in coverage over protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission threatened for telecommunic@@ ations with fin@@ es and closure if they continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call for violence . &quot;
without cable TV and inform@@ ational national TV channels I filed myself with @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
amazing that this is still cheaper than to purchase two litres of li@@ on@@ ade .
the local NGO Con@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is not accessible by a blocking of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) but also two more online channels . this also applies the website , on which the National Assembly transfers their sessions .
formerly resear@@ ches of the institute for press and society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had revealed that local Internet providers may stay on DNS . in this case , it concerns technology due to the DNS server in@@ quiries by certain domains .
if an Internet is blocked by the DNS server , the server will be incorrect or denied the request when calling on a website .
we confirm having a DNS lock : @ el@@ ik@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
with V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , the transmission was discontinued on Thursday 6th April , when the V@@ PI@@ TV cam@@ er@@ aman El@@ vis Flo@@ res , who survived the protests in Caracas , was taken into custody .
Flo@@ res was defeated , while he was in custody facilities .
eight hours later , he was released and V@@ PI@@ TV was going on show again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , there was also announced that the government is regulated by the Internet connection : the Ven@@ z@@ ol@@ an@@ ians make access to multi media coverage regarding the current events of the country .
in Paraguay many girls will be a slave to get a training
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a Cri@@ min@@ ita child . now she visited the house where she worked for many years .
today Tina for the rights of children and collec@@ ts testimonies of other Cri@@ min@@ itas , which were exactly how they were victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the shortened version of a report from Kur@@ ds , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; F@@ lying cows , dec@@ aying schools &quot; ) , edited and re @-@ published by Global Vo@@ ices in Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household , in which she did not eat together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her studies at the university , she returned to the house again , and heard how the owner of the house had full of pride , saying , &quot; She is like a daughter of us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old , she began working as Cri@@ min@@ ita for the family . as Cri@@ min@@ itas , the more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the shop is very simple : a large family with little money is giving their minim@@ alist son or her min@@ ors @-@ old daughter to another , rich family . in exchange the child gets food , a training and a roof over the head .
however , what is not mentioned in this case , that the children must pay for countless days of house@@ work , which may never be paid and abuse of abuse and abuse may be able - and all that can &apos;t lift up in the framework of a contract that is not able to raise .
this referred to as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widely used in Paraguay with the participation and acceptance of large parts of the society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations .
after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization that f@@ ights for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ min@@ itas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected witness statements , calcul@@ ating and p@@ iti@@ ated .
she tried to call things at the name , because the feeling of grat@@ itude that vacc@@ inated the Cri@@ min@@ itas , guaranteed in general .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; says Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
the family , which is their daughter in the belief that they shut up their training as their training , improve their position in society and can do something from itself , to another family .
on the other hand , the family , which takes up the girl with him and whose exploitation is right with the faith , that she would give someone any chance that would not get any formation , and perhaps it would be hungry .
the Vic@@ tims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is har@@ assed , his family will only experience many years later .
sometimes they even never know it .
in January 2016 , the so far relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the secret in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín was in hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , the body showed signs of heavy stro@@ kes . shortly afterwards she died .
she was 14 years old .
it was Cri@@ min@@ ita in the household of Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , which works as an official office at the registration office .
Mar@@ ín was living in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
in late January 2016 Fer@@ re@@ ira struck down as long as a river on Mar@@ ín until they suffered dead@@ ly injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
some days later the media reported on the incident .
they finished that the murdered child was a Cri@@ min@@ ita .
organizations such as UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deeply ro@@ oted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an society for the death of the girl .
they signed the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came to protest in protest and demanded that there will be no other Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widespread in the social media .
in Paraguay , more cows are registered as children , compl@@ ain Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control , among which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the sp@@ a@@ ars and nearly 60 civil society organizations demanded that a rapid investigation on the fall .
they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was sentenced to 30 years in prison by Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo .
if the case is found in court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be landmark , if the case for the first time in the history of Paraguay a fall of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is coming .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ min@@ ita
Cri@@ min@@ itas will not only explo@@ ited workers for workers , ins@@ ulated by other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bik office in which her father worked , bank@@ rupt@@ cy , and their father lost his work .
your brothers had to work all working and started to sell on the street , or on the market swe@@ ets to earn money .
but they all went to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón in the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
in the house of their employer , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day .
yet they had to share the time so that you remained at the time for learning .
she rose up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for their employer .
on Fridays , they cleansed the refrigerator , plaster the living room , polished the furniture , and the infected ground .
when the school was at the end , she went home again and had time to learn .
ever they had finished with learning , the more leisure had her .
but this time was limited , because they had to make a dinner for their employ@@ ers .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she had never been hungry , but got not unlimited food . &quot; I could pick up more books from the library of the master &apos;s library as a meal from the fridge , &quot; they are remin@@ is@@ cent of her .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the house@@ holder , a former military and sympath@@ izers of Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , who was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who belonged to the opposition from 1954 to 1989 .
in some evenings of the house of Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , in addition to him and gui@@ ding articles from opposition items such as &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; or &quot; El Pueb@@ lo . &quot;
he attempted to convince them to convince the reports from the official media on the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he stayed for intelligent , but did not teach her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the house of the managers had found someone who heard it , while he spoke about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they did not allow me to visit my family , because they were the opinion that I would like to learn there again &quot; bad hab@@ its , &quot; that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ ani , at home her mother tongue Guar@@ ani would speak at home .
their Lord feared the education that they had enabled , would lose it again .
it was completely clear that they had paid for everything she had paid from them to their hard work .
also in school Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a discrimin@@ ates . &quot; one thing that almost never been spoken , are mo@@ b@@ bing and the ic@@ ans to whom Cri@@ min@@ itas are exposed to school whenever they go to school .
because the other children parents have , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents , is a cri@@ mp@@ ita .
I was able to invite you to home . I did not have a circle of friends in the school , or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time where friend@@ ships arise , I felt very clearly that I belonged to any group .
the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; says Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
the Society Appro@@ ves the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group , in which one can share boo@@ kl@@ ess for cleaning agents and children &apos;s ma@@ ids in Paraguay .
the administration offices of the Group is Pep@@ a Kost@@ ian@@ ov@@ sky , a town council in the As@@ unci@@ ón district .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter , who played in the morning and in the afternoon with her .

please inqu@@ ire to you .
beginning from Monday , if possible .
the ad got five &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the village of Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she would have had an old girl and gave her telephone number .
another woman who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by also offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes little children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
in the third review was written by &quot; a girl from the inner inner that wants to work . &quot;
then the authors switched on the ad once a :
Dear friends , I have found one . I look like it works with her .
thank you , I am writing again if something is .
the shop was finished .
in the pro@@ log@@ ue to report Cri@@ min@@ itas , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ?
( Cri@@ min@@ itas , how long yet ? ) , a collection of witness testimonies former Cri@@ min@@ itas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z :
in the course of our history we managed to abol@@ ish systems like slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice coming from the Spanish conqu@@ ist@@ adors in Paraguay ) and the nati@@ ves were subjected to the Spanish conqu@@ ist@@ adors in Paraguay , and the nati@@ ves were subjected to them that many girls and boys involved themselves in a system of slavery where they become a light sacrifice for abuse and exploitation .
social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and the vision of power are the key to the understanding of the phenom@@ ena known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill design writes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government
image of Pix@@ ab@@ ay , changes from Global Vo@@ ices .
published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
sixty Egyptian parliamentary committee had recently approved a bill to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; voted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ulators and Social Networks &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he is accepted by Parliament , users must register social media in Egypt by a government authority to use social media , including Facebook and Twitter .
on the basis of the law would then be set up a place that is responsible for use the citizens and citizens to share social media .
within six months with acceptance of the law , users have to register users and users on the site of the site with its correct name and identity numbers to use social networking .
if it failed to do this , this could bring a penalty of up to six months in jail or a fine of money .
the bill , which consists of six paragra@@ phs , and in local media , including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt independent ) , defines social media as &quot; every application that is running and used to communicate with others by voice , video messages and text . &quot;
it is un@@ clear how the law is set out when the draft account is provided , as Egyptian authorities are supposed to determine the user how they are supposed to register for those who are unable to register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure the regulation on stage of social media companies .

this could mean that Egypt is planning to raise a fire@@ wall on national level around Facebook . because of them it would be necessary for Egypt inside and Egyptians to submit information on their identity to access the network .
but it is so far not known that such plans exist .
experts and experts on site are sc@@ ep@@ tical about technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the flags .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( based on German &quot; leading researcher &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R ) , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I doub@@ ted strongly to the technical capacity and the understanding of neither authority in Egypt regarding things that have done with technology . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in my opinion , they imagine that just as they did for@@ ci@@ ble physical and private rooms , it could also be done online .
if I take it , then it means that they will request a powerful surveillance system to request citizens , who apply a permission , or not . and this means a mad system to monitor the activities of people and to bring it to a court process .
this is technically no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
in order to be adopted as a law , the draft will initially be discussed under the legisl@@ ature of Parliament and the constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate .
whether his acceptance and en@@ forcement will be successful or not , the draft &quot; stands in line with a pro @-@ military thinking in parliament in whose meaning , no devi@@ ating Nar@@ ration on the image is present , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .

high above in the mountains of the Kurdistan region in the northeast of Iraq work the veter@@ inary sur@@ geon H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and their team of scientists of NGOs in the non @-@ governmental organisation Nature Iraq , to protect the intellectual op@@ ards .
a sub@@ type of the larger family of Leop@@ ards , which spreads through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . in total , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to wild animals , the loss and the fra@@ cture of their living area , as they do always find less prey , end@@ anger@@ ed .
why is this specific type of le@@ op@@ ards so important ?
as R@@ aza in the video shows , &quot; the Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remainder of the Kur@@ dish ecos@@ ystem &quot; and the health and the growth of the ecos@@ ystem , too , that a large pre@@ dat@@ or is present .
the chance to watch a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the free bo@@ di@@ way is small and goes against zero . as the team in the video you determine that they have a recording of a large cat in the camera trap , R@@ aza breaks out in pure joy .
as a trained Bi@@ olog@@ in , R@@ aza is passionate about another site of their country , which is not only of war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies on wild animals and programs of Nature Iraq for six years .
since 2013 , it has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and assumes that protective zones for wildlife will be established in the Kurdistan region .

at the beginning of March 2017 , the daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o , the progress made for the North East Japan were to re@@ build the life of those who were affected by the &quot; triple disaster &quot; of March 2011 . an massive earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima happened .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , located in the pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ fecture was in Japan &apos;s northeast , both experien@@ cing both the earthquake and the ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring countries of Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were evacu@@ ated , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had van@@ ish all the coastal cities of the map .
even more , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima experienced a nuclear accident , just about 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses .
the special report of K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o shows a local view@@ point of which progress has been reached after six years later in order to re@@ build the lives of local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as the survey results of those affected themselves .
the residential building in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o &apos;s newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare parts ( that was completed by December 2015 , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate were finished .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i showed the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , 80 percent of the planned spare parts were finished .
I@@ w@@ ate has finished 75 percent of such houses while around Fu@@ kus@@ hima joined the final turn@@ around with 70 percent .
yet again , six years after the cat@@ astrophe , evacu@@ ated from Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ wald ( beginning @-@ time , kas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) to be re@@ located in final replacement houses .
after the triple disaster , nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ wald .
in December 2016 , there were still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate in such conditions .
almost 40 percent of the evacu@@ ated companies of Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live in emer@@ gen@@ cies , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i had a succ@@ es@@ ful success . more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ated those after the disaster in Beh@@ el@@ bows were moved in final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ades this figure is 34 percent .
the status of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o Newspaper could determine that 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , who were affected by the mis@@ fortune , opened its doors down to December 2016 , which makes almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction is far more difficult in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
while almost 100 per cent of fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ades and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i have now returned to operate in Fu@@ kus@@ hima only 30 percent of the fishing ports have been resum@@ ed .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and nuclear accident , have moved in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures agricultural land large @-@ area @-@ wide .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could recover 93 percent of its agricultural land , but only 66 percent of the ar@@ able land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 per cent destro@@ y@@ able farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
it is un@@ likely that this is only a result of the atomic fact , because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed ar@@ able land of Fu@@ kus@@ hima are located in the &quot; nuclear pl@@ ywood area . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , the tourism has largely recovered , but Fu@@ kus@@ hima still remains unbe@@ aten .
the tourist figures in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again up to 90 percent in the same stand as before the mis@@ fortune . Fu@@ kus@@ hima can only show up to 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o Newspaper also reports that almost half of the inhabitants are almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it is more difficult to earn their li@@ vel@@ ih@@ ood .
is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
in order to determine a total photograph , the newspaper carried out numerous surveys under the local population and under the evacu@@ ated population . she asked them about the status of re@@ building and also how their indig@@ nation has changed over the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in the introduction of the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o led a survey to bring out more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness under the native population .
the survey carried out that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents took measures to be taken in order to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.9 percent of respon@@ dents have still not been done enough in the cat@@ astroph@@ es of disast@@ ers .
as it stands to be evacu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
in its issue of the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper has strengthened its attention also to the position of evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
Fu@@ kus@@ hima had not only had to experience the massive earthquake and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima was also witness of the worst , disaster @-@ caused , atomic fact that had to experience the Japan ever .
almost 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the Pre@@ fecture of around 160 000 evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
at the beginning of 2016 there were a little over 23 000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , in permanent spare parts .
after the 2017 state of 2017 , there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima off their home pre@@ fecture .
in the disaster areas most of the evacu@@ ation areas are more than 50 years old . they are able to re@@ locate in proper home conditions , because the efforts to re@@ build Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima will compete with massive construction projects . here are building projects that are part of the Olympic Games which will be held in Tokyo in 2020 .
the world is small : our po@@ d@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
if people encoun@@ tered from other countries , which speak another language , the differences seem to be greater than the simil@@ ar@@ ities .
after a while , however , one recogni@@ zes that there seems to be more than it appears at first sight .
these global connections are important , since they come out our proposals to enlarge our perspectives and remember that the world is finally very small .
in this sequence of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look at exactly this global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep po@@ d@@ cast we handle topics that will often earn less attention than they earn .
we speak to five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they felt very strongly associated with someone about voice and international borders .
Veron@@ ika Kri@@ con@@ i speaks about the simil@@ ar@@ ities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ i is remin@@ is@@ cent of the lack of common language skills during a journey in rural China ; Adri@@ ana M@@ aci@@ as talks about the time where they worked with people from all over the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences that he has collected in a small village in Madagascar .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in artificial coma , after being defeated by the police in national demonstrations
left : the attack against Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva . photo : Lu@@ iz da Luz . publication with permission .
right : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva has a very common photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit : last Friday , a police officer was defeated at a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with a stroke at the head . nationwide millions of demonstr@@ ators participated in a protest against au@@ ster@@ oids .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , studied social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered several fra@@ c@@ tures .
doctors operated him on Saturday and have now transferred it into an artificial coma .
his condition is considered serious .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus which rapidly managed quickly in Brazil within a few days .
the pictures can also recognize the face of the police officer , which was identified with a stroke attack . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the end of the case of the case of active service .
the pictures show the police officers , as it strikes in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his impact on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
if a police officer was beaten by a demonstr@@ ators and landing on the Inten@@ sive care unit , his face would be seen six months in television and the entire suppression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ol@@ al@@ iz@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activ@@ ist from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , divided the video in the net , in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked from the police officer , and several wash@@ rooms shortly thereafter .
another video with the same scenes , but from another perspective , is also immersed in social networks .
in the below shown clip you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users now lives 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( approximately 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover a part of the costs for medical treatment and to keep his family in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , while at hospital .
&quot; be vali@@ ant , Mat@@ eus .

the drawing was dealt several times in the social networks .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for more violent crimes against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás :
Go@@ i@@ ás experienced a wave of political power : here , the activity of a W@@ hat@@ s@@ app Group had been killed here , because he was attacked the Occup@@ y Movement in secondary schools . now , we have been attacked the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who has been attacked by a polic@@ emen who struck him with a stroke .
police handles
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil in which it came to demonstr@@ ators against demonstr@@ ators over the past Friday .
polic@@ emen trained in protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a stage for Red@@ ner , rubber migrants and lac@@ ri@@ eng@@ as .
on violence against demonstr@@ ators , members of Fl@@ avi@@ o Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( PS@@ OL ) , the police operated on violence against demonstr@@ ators .
this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country .
once again , the Brazilian media street protests swe@@ pt , decl@@ ining the focus on another , unexpected prot@@ agon@@ ists : a window of window .
the fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and est@@ ado de S. Paulo were specifically designed for a broken glass window with a photo of their cover pages .
in contrast , the O global@@ o is preferred by a title story with a set of fire .
there is no pl@@ au@@ sible journ@@ alistic cause , more about a broken window disc than the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special thing .
this is necessary to recogn@@ ise that if you stri@@ ve against any form of atomic damage .
here , the term &quot; V@@ and@@ alism , &quot; an ab@@ sur@@ d , an un@@ disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ate , and the typical violent of the military police are marked by head@@ lines with the title &quot; demonstr@@ ators on con@@ front@@ ation course with the police . &quot;
the villages of Ab@@ in@@ du@@ str@@ o For@@ gotten Vill@@ ages to Cuba
with the introduction of the Act of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso closed almost hundreds of sugar tubes throughout Cuba ( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ atist@@ a )
the parish community Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cub@@ an province of May@@ abe@@ que , is widely known as a Central - at Spanish Sug@@ ar mill - regardless of what there are no significant sug@@ ars on site .
it is two years ago when the activities were manufactured in the sugar tubes factories .
after getting the sugar @-@ tube industry in the region , and the factory lost after and after its plants , until only the rum@@ our of steel and concrete remained .
some 272 workers had to find themselves .
some change the work .
many re@@ signed and comm@@ utes daily to the factories which still grinding .
N@@ ene , a solo &apos; veter@@ an , who rises every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar tubes industry smo@@ kes not his sleep .
he heard that it exists in the east of the region of sugar tubes , which are back in operation after long in@@ active time because they have been preserved .
that was something that it was not expected .
N@@ ene reminds himself exactly that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ I would receive the sugar cane factory , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar industry resistance has already been the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the case of socialism , the low market prices , the severe administrative decisions and climate change .
in 2016 the production of 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the 1910 were produced .
the news would have been a motive for a couple of decades a motive for the country , but the bad harvest are not even Neu@@ vity .
why was the Cub@@ an sugar industry turned off ?
the old railway station of the commune looked already better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ atist@@ a )
the reduction of the sugar tubes industry was an economic need : the 155 sugar tubes were technically ob@@ sol@@ ete , and hardly competitive they were in@@ compatible for the country .
the initial idea was to focus on the most efficient factories , the annual production goal was 4 million tonnes .
they only left the factories which can produce sugar for at most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the moti@@ fs that led to such measures were the low productivity of the sugar cane plants and the sug@@ ars on the global market .
nevertheless , the sugar price increased about one decade ago .
from 2017 through 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar has to stay between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 report , &quot; Land Sustainable Development &quot; from the OECD and FAO , the Agriculture and Nutrition organization of the United Nations .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate circa 85 million dollars for the country .
not all ran well
&quot; today &apos;s day will go down with security in history , &quot; that was the first words of the Cub@@ an President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o .
from there began the process of restructuring in the sugar industry .
in the following years the shut@@ ting of a total of 98 sugar tubes , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further training .
the same thing happened in the sugar cane factory Gregori@@ o Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
if N@@ ene , as it is known as a soldier , is talking about the closure of the factory , is the word that he repeated most , &quot; sc@@ am . &quot;
almost all of those surveyed are the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order to receive the place they were a full @-@ time working group .
in front of the first year of lie@@ utenant , the first letters started to come .
it was officially adopted documents that only be removed in terms of parts that would be removed , the address sat and the date .
all were signed by Ul@@ timo Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve each withdrawal .
and from there , the responsibility was taken over and the letters were more common .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the l@@ act@@ ate factory for two years , and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for those in running sugar tubes , as@@ sures us .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for the retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was also involved in the shut@@ ting of the factory in which construction he helped , in which construction he helped .
with every part that he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 years of work .
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important jobs have been extingu@@ ished .
in many cases , no alternatives for work equi@@ val@@ ents and services were produced in the congregations where they were present .
we will never know if during the mamm@@ oth speech of October 21 , 2002 , the former president in the eyes of the present people saw when he was guaranteed for those who were not running since five years , everything would run well .
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar tubes
since 2004 , sugar cane has only been extracted high by grinding .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ atist@@ a )
after two years , the Municipality of Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always at the time when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or better , when they began to ab@@ on@@ ate them , they also heard on paved road , this dis@@ advant@@ aged also other farms .
without work in the region , and with already advanced age , n@@ ene and Ed@@ dy others had to search for other factories .
they were shared to spare parts .
without any future perspective , many young people left the region once again .
in the area the food factory was created whose production is not once used for the supply of the commune .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
Ne@@ un@@ und@@ forty explo@@ ited the old soldiers a pension of two thousand Pes@@ o per month to spend the years retired in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin colour , small , with a few teeth and clear voice , is no retro@@ fitting person , yet he gives the lies that one told him , not .
they have been dealing with him for ten years .
N@@ ene is working with 65 years of age , not because it is missing in power , but because he is bitter .

first Nations youth use Hi@@ p @-@ Hop to express yourself and get their own culture

young people of the first Nations communities in Canada are dealing with topics which are important for them . they do not do with hip @-@ hop , thanks to a number of hiking workshops .
since 2014 , as part of the N &apos; we J@@ in@@ an Tour , workshop and youth centers have been performing directly to schools and youth centers to include youth groups son@@ g@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live appearances .
the original workshops were led by the ped@@ agogue David Hod@@ ges , who lives in Montreal and in North Quebec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then worked with the Cre@@ e Hi@@ p @-@ Hop Group The North@@ Stars .
the workshop continues to ensure that the young particip@@ ations in our discussions related topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , strug@@ gles , love , self @-@ acceptable &quot; or what to them in mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos , in which the young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other first Nations communities in Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the trunk of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the US state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Y@@ oo in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia tells us the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; on which almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered .
the cases were not resolved .
the next video of the Nem@@ o Cre@@ e First nation uses the motive of a video player to mediate , as important as the preservation of traditional S@@ itten and customs , despite influences through the global@@ ization .
many of the songs have appeared in indigenous languages , although the yo@@ ungst@@ ers have not always rule the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation recorded , the refra@@ ction will be sung in Cre@@ e .
the yo@@ ungst@@ ers took some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the North@@ stars Hi@@ p @-@ Hop group who gave them a St@@ rop@@ he in dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
on the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ page of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an , the St@@ rop@@ he is available in the address , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German :
sometimes I feel like would not ever be interested in me
but I continue to continue my days on the earth
that is the day when you &apos;ll understand our cry .
because we lost our way to life in life
but I think we will be able to raise us a day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so you can grow and lead the same as our youth
so you can do it , for which the Creator has determined

in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant
plastic dishes ( c . ) outside of a typical restaurants in Japan .

in Japan you can see almost every restaurant of plastic dishes .
to show potential customers what exactly on the menu is to be found in the vicinity of the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin to pur@@ u ( oc@@ ative , &quot; plastic models of dishes &quot; ) of each food which is served in this restaurant .
customers can see these plastic dishes and decide if they enter or go on the restaurant .
there is an entire industry devoted to manufacture of these plastic dishes .
in the C@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi district of K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi there is a variety of these small businesses that manufacture the plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese cars are these plastic dishes so usually that they did not find them once more . a new trend is transformed , however , into amazing mobile accessories and other g@@ ad@@ gets .
at N@@ aver Mat@@ ome published the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos that demonstrate this unusual tw@@ ist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin .
now in special sale : new with plastic gr@@ ated mobile tapes were shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u Kauf@@ haus .
many of these artificial foods have been changed to kit@@ ch items , as in this case , fridge k@@ mag@@ nets :
here are a few Sho@@ a fridge k@@ mag@@ nets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo station .
the new boom in the ess@@ ences will increasingly van@@ ish .
in this case an imper@@ ial @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was transformed into a mobile phone support .
for these tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile phone support .
we also have this part for the Tokyo exhibition in Tokyo .
and here is an Apple to hold your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple , using a guy for the mobile , it is already a great design .
and that &apos;s only the beginning of an increasing flight into the Com@@ ic .
some mobile phone support and mobile phone designers allow you to produce your own artwork . in this case , ik@@ ura or salmon are used , a popular t@@ opping with white rice is served .
on Twitter some users had their doub@@ ts :
is there someone who say would say : &quot; Wow , cool , now I can get rid of my mobile phone with salmon ? . &quot;
I think I will be the only tiny one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also assume a less appet@@ ite form to surprise some colleagues or family members .

in reports in@@ - and foreign media about the not@@ orious &quot; fighting against drugs trade &quot; in Mexico do not sc@@ uba diving regularly in statistics . however , this mirror is not reflected at all the extent of human tragedy that this battle is with him .
the reporting on drug bos@@ ses like El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the Chief of the Sin@@ al@@ oa Cart@@ ells , pushed the stories of the conflict in the background .
on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the g@@ rief or to the churches that have learned to live with the pain .
behind each bone , behind each bone re@@ funds in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners are perhaps to heal .
that is why the Mexican news portal animal Pol@@ í@@ tico is the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ en@@ a Vi@@ vi@@ r C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; dealing with the drug trade , &quot; ) to give this victims a vote and stories of people telling the battle between the prosecution and cart@@ els .
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project :
organiz@@ ational crimes can not only fear our lives .
the effects are far pro@@ found .
for example , if shops close because they are threatened by drug tra@@ ders and all the municipalities need to drive a lot of kilometers to buy something like milk .
the pain of victims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how fear@@ ing life &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells about this stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who is looking for every weekend of secret graves after his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ guez , who lost their father and their four sisters , their husband and two of her neph@@ ew .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priest : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again to the task that we have put forward , and after the graves , we have loved us to search for the people who we loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in a electric store in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came back . Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it is very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need a training .
there is also my mother , which is also here with me .
at the moment it has no income .
you are the insurance of my father , but she does not get paid out because that require a death certificate .
where should we get those ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ un@@ a vi@@ vi@@ r con el nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
we do not only need to show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts of frag@@ ility and the govern@@ ance .
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some extracts from stories .
K@@ Y@@ HB , a woman of animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post in Tax@@ co , in the State of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
their contribution is remin@@ is@@ cent of us that violence should never be considered normal , no matter , in which form them occurs :
I have been familiar with disease and Sens@@ ational journ@@ alism for some years now .
I come to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ken every day and see the title page with pictures , which actually can only come from a textbook for crimin@@ ology or from specialists from specialists .
it takes me from the version .
sometimes I &apos;ve got the feeling , as if I am the one , the ange@@ ment or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body once .
I can &apos;t be equal to or this is considered normal .
she writes on :
no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin think that he is great . and it is not normal that people listen to people over the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of the offen@@ ders , when they go through the streets .
for me , that is , than would they have lost those who have lost someone and those who have fear that something happened .
I see our weakness , if stories are to block numbers in a statistic .
the facts of human beings is unbeliev@@ ably for me when the death of six people and the dis@@ appearance of 43 students in a neighboring village will be justified that they were &quot; rising . &quot;
I think they try to agree that they are spar@@ ed from such tragedy when they are not stirring and still .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; Four months of awak@@ ening in the main city district : &quot; like a family with dr@@ um@@ ings , &quot; it describes how armed crime month had been destroyed for month &apos;s money , until they had not only destroyed the store , but also their family apart .
you think all that you lost and remember how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain never goes up that trau@@ ma remains high , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
hab@@ its have changed , contact numbers also .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the more we are removed from each other , the better .
she completed her report with the words :
we want to be arrested that the others are arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will cause you to kill or kill .
I asked myself in these aw@@ ful days , if you would dissolve my deepest root feelings , but the answer is no , for I forgot how to weep . I have to learn how to live with the pain .
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the contribution &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation of violence . &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions on how to : who car@@ es about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by the organized crime ?
how is it in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care for them .
Br@@ yan is a Wa@@ ise and he tells that he had to kill himself as one egg co@@ ater , bo@@ iled potatoes , tortillas warm and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies that makes it home with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left hand - one for each year of life .
but they are not significantly compared to pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a young man for all the life of violence and who had to learn to live with them .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood had been over two years before , when he was just a few blocks away from his home , the bloody dead bodies of his father , who had been shot by armed men from an ab@@ sent car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 when violence through the organized crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of bills for public security and the government of the United States government .
in 2010 alone , the Prosec@@ ution filed 3@@ 103 counts . this is equivalent to 8.5 Mor@@ den per day .
these are just some of hundreds of thousands of stories that leaves the organized crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country .
only few stories live in view of new head@@ lines . this project reminds us of those who are not forgotten .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ en@@ a Vi@@ vi@@ r C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; brought the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data into life , whose goal is to present the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trade , which the country has tor@@ mented in the past four decades , in a simple way .
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; Sh@@ aring is Car@@ ing &quot; from Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this post and sides , to which he left , contain images on which violence is represented .
the fact check is important at a moment in which it comes to raise an report or a counter@@ f@@ eit .
but what is the year that something is di@@ pped for the first time ? content in social media , no matter whether it is true or true , tend to exist .
let us take this photo of a terrible accident , seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
since its first release , it has been used ir@@ re@@ pris@@ ingly , trage@@ dies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false coupling of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Draft News - denied the fact that there are pl@@ enti@@ fully careful coverage of events in the DRC , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it th@@ rows questions about our desire to go to pictures .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 , a tan@@ ker left the place S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ t and explo@@ ded . 230 people lost their lives .
after the civil war in Africa , Africa had been neg@@ le@@ cted and devast@@ ated . the streets in the region became dangerous p@@ aving full of drums , which were difficult to ride .
it fell victim to the fuel tank wagons .
it representatives described a fire ball , the dozens of living houses , including a cinem@@ as close to people that was full of people who illustr@@ ate the soccer world championships .
houses dist@@ ressed and carbon@@ ated dead bodies were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to the infinite .
a painting with the title &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; by Im@@ g@@ ur users Myst@@ ical Monkey , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ multiple photos of the occurr@@ ence form the grey scenes of this day .
above is an example .
it displays rows of carbon@@ ated body , which can be rounded up on the floor during persons .
but here the story does not find its end .
over the years the same photo was wi@@ ped by several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms , but may not be attributed to the trage@@ dies , particularly events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on January 3 , 2015 the fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am held the le@@ gen@@ eous n@@ ig@@ eri@@ an towns of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
eyel@@ ids reported dra@@ stically of atro@@ cities , before whom they had to flee .
houses and shops were burnt down and dead bodies were burned in streets and bones .
there were reports that 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one stayed back to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a person to Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were cro@@ oked , shot or burnt .
only using satellite images the follow @-@ up time could be illustrated .
the reason for the attack remained un@@ explained , but the army @-@ based point in Bagh@@ dad was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am , country to win ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture from the DR Kongo on , as it was f@@ row@@ ly presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented :
this is Nigeria .
the massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this miss@@ ile use of the image of the DR Congo is only one in a number of false abor@@ tions ; Africa Check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the picture was vor@@ ced as a letter for mass@@ acres .
another step further bring personal comments as this example the picture from the DR Congo with the sources of mass media in connection to deliver arguments .
the picture from S@@ ange also joined forces in conjunction with the dead@@ ly prosecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a lightning message , published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee stro@@ kes , rape and some dead , some through burning .
while others of violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya reported , Post@@ s like the following descriptions were brought together with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture was taken from an Saudi Arabian News page , which had failed in 2012 , the President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ ein said that mon@@ ks and politicians had participated in the assassination of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to disc@@ ern this information .
the original contribution , which was accessed by April 26 , 2017 , can be accessed here .
other News agencies , AF@@ P mentioned as their source , had also been attributed to this statement , but did not allow the image of the DR Congo in connection .
the worldwide operating range of false information
traces of these wrong de@@ coupling ranges up to the years 2011 and 2012 , and actually come from anywhere in all over the world .
with the help of a &quot; re @-@ returned image &quot; you can see how far more information can be reached .
a converted picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has been showing 344 images under 18.@@ 8 billion images ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) 344 images showing the image of the DR Congo very similar .
they come from a mixed mas@@ ch private side , platforms social media and community , as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some of the wrong reports have re@@ directed , others have attempted to expos@@ e the for@@ geri@@ es .
we have introduced examples of im@@ it@@ ant use and associated with the respective countries , based on which page they were published . by this way we want to clari@@ fy the range than by the language alone .
several examples of ab@@ usive use can come from the below listed countries ( which were also linked together in some cases ) .
here are some cases that can now be split completely ( on the map in orange ) :
card : News Fr@@ ames .
country examples of incorrect head of the image from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries are based on pages or server , on the examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or fal@@ cons are still available .
the countries in grey are examples , according to the met@@ ad@@ ata and information that are available via Tin@@ Eye , probably also counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing examples .
as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma -@@ Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the picture from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to al@@ er@@ ci@@ er and interested Arab ) as part of a thread to the war of the Budd@@ hist@@ s against Muslims . &quot;

Canada , 2015 .
in this post a blo@@ gger from Quebec City does not only hear the false report of the image from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria as well as further questions according to the inten@@ tions of persons and the di@@ ced trage@@ dies ( in the DR Congo and beyond ) .
Ecuador , 2013 . &quot; EN Nigeria est@@ án qu@@ em@@ ando a los Crist@@ ian@@ os &quot; ( in Nigeria he burn the Christians ) .
in this article on explo@@ sions in North @-@ Kan@@ i in Nigeria , published in the newspaper La Rep@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , the district is identified as the Christian part of the place .
La Rep@@ ú@@ b@@ lica quotes as his source the Spanish News Agency EF@@ E ( which is not known whether the original report has the picture ) .
France , 2015 .
according to the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am , as this here , who used the picture from the DR Congo to illustr@@ ate the &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam &quot; to illustr@@ ate this , they have no pages like Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster , who contra@@ di@@ ct this .
Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster named the def@@ ective use of the image since 2011 in conjunction with Nigeria , then promoted by a post of US American , anti @-@ Islamic comm@@ ent@@ ator Pam@@ ela G@@ eller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Germany , 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; genocide against Muslims continues in Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Peace Manifest@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this article gives attention to the continuous use of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims in Myanmar , but quotes the work of an article of Indian Express with the image from the DR Congo ; the article by Indian Express had not included the time of publication of this image .
Greece , 2012 . &quot; the beginning of the tour !

this page was used as a evidence that Muslims put to death Muslims .
this statement was contra@@ cted by a Greek fac@@ ial check @-@ page in 2013 and once again in 2016 .
Iran , 2012 .
a federation of students of the@@ ology ( Mul@@ l@@ ahs ) in Islamic countries released an open letter to support the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims of the Nas@@ im and used illustr@@ ating the picture of the DR Congo .
Italy , 2015 .
one inhabit@@ ant of the old city of P@@ ie@@ dic@@ ast@@ ello from Tren@@ to posted this message to its side in order to express his solidarity with the massacre in Nigeria in 2015 .
Nigeria , 2012 .
even within Nigeria this photo was taken from the DR Congo as a test@@ ament to the strikes of the B@@ oko Har@@ am in Kan@@ o in public discussion for@@ ums .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme example of an ab@@ usive use of the image from the DR Congo , with one hand , the sympath@@ y opposite to the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , and on the other hand of a blo@@ g@@ gers , the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are persecuted , because the photos were mis@@ used .
Myanmar , 2017 .
the government of Myanmar released a correc@@ t@@ ful of what they arrived as &quot; inten@@ tional wear and photos , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understanding with regards to Myanmar . &quot;
this correc@@ t@@ ance that appeared exclusively in English , includes references to counter@@ f@@ ake images from sc@@ iss@@ ants , the H@@ ate Spe@@ ech operate and by extrem@@ ist groups to define that Muslims Budd@@ hist@@ s kill and ander@@ s@@ rum ( which often is widely used by bur@@ ese national@@ ists ) .
Russia , 2012 . &quot; F@@ Х@@ р@@ и@@ с@@ т@@ и@@ к@@ е@@ т@@ и@@ к@@ е@@ т@@ и@@ к@@ е@@ т@@ и@@ к@@ и@@ н .
this post that addressed to the members of the Russian @-@ orthodo@@ x congregation , clearly states that the image of the DR Congo is NOT Muslims who should kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page is claimed that the President of Myanmar was suspic@@ ious in 2012 that mon@@ ks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims , and brought the story together with the picture from S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this release is the picture continues .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 on students who had been murdered by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the Catholic Church on An@@ á@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has explicitly stated that the picture was not taken from the red@@ ness , but it claims that it was a &quot; similar d@@ Shi@@ ps attack . &quot;
when the picture later became in circulation with the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am from 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to cancel that there would be connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Y@@ an@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ us@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria bur@@ ns the world sleeps ) .
the picture of the DR Kongo is equipped with this t@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and dissolved a discussion under the Muslims at the B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 massacre and on the flags on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve that their communities took place that they took place in the name of the Islam@@ s , a greater attention .
United States , 2015 .
the picture was made as letter to the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ret@@ aining ) , but the messages that were associated with these were not taken up in no religious context .
instead , the goal was to raise attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of the media coverage in comparison of Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Malt@@ ese ) , 2014 .
after a message which had been supp@@ os@@ edly written by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mart@@ os &quot; on the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre had been written in circulation , it was translated into discussion as this here on Vietnamese and declared it to be a false report .
from the message in which the image of the DR Congo had been included , the organisation of Clar@@ et@@ iner mission@@ are and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mart@@ os .
there are further confirmed examples of an incorrect use of the picture from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , Netherlands and Argentina .
based on other accounts , aggreg@@ ators , and pages in the following countries ( at the portfolio in grey ) , however , these versions are not fully tra@@ ce@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with UR@@ Ls and tim@@ est@@ amps exist in the Web@@ cra@@ wler and occasionally they have image file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslim . )
in all these cases that appeared only clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture shows a correct description but the original entry is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong topics or frames ( ir@@ radiation ) , who walk through this post . the first frame is focused on religion .
the photo was used in reference to greater discussions on the silence of Christians in connection with Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the ex@@ h@@ ort@@ ation of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as through Budd@@ hist@@ s .
a second Fr@@ aming uses the picture to discuss how a African life is under@@ valued compared to a European or French life .
religion is to be understood and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worthwhile to examine how images may be used in connection with these efforts .
however , a more detailed question is what happens when reading these images can not give any longer belief .
with social media there are mer@@ ciful people who have un@@ intended to tr@@ ines the water around a tragedy .
sug@@ ger@@ ated this mood of false and false information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and hal@@ es the real hor@@ ror of what actually happened in the DR Congo in Nigeria and in Myanmar ?
the spread of for@@ ci@@ ble pictures was already deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
an argument is that the re@@ proof of pictures of a ref@@ us@@ al to recogn@@ ise the tragedy . sometimes these pictures are even required by the victims .
at the same time , the concern is that for@@ ci@@ ble pictures of readers and viewers des@@ si@@ zing and give them the ability to emp@@ ath@@ y indig@@ ath@@ y ( such as this study , who sought to work as for@@ ci@@ ble media to help others ) .
while there are some for@@ ci@@ ble represent@@ ations in the news media there is fact that they are indisp@@ ens@@ able for today &apos;s news coverage .
techn@@ ologists experim@@ enting with algorith@@ ms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News . &quot; they will be thoroughly thinking about the situation in which a picture is something suggests , but it can also be replaced by context or completely mis@@ ery kind .
any study of false grants should also take into consideration how international they can be .

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uni@@ qu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo of Andy Simmons used in accordance with CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name of Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. d@@ t. un@@ mist@@ ak@@ able ) ende@@ av@@ oured to offer a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to transl@@ ate at all .
such words are in any language : you press some situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these un@@ acceptable words are already well @-@ known ( like the famous port@@ ug@@ uese da@@ de ) and others that are deeply ro@@ oted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ ber@@ me@@ a ) .
but all resist hard to each attempt of a simple translation .
one word or expression is not enough , so why a full explanation and sometimes a little context is required to understand exactly what is meant with this one word .
these unique words have been collected all over a long time in an online list .
most of these lists of Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist@@ ics of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
for example , in the blog you can find words from V@@ anu@@ at@@ u V@@ anu@@ at@@ u as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Col@@ oring your parents in recognition of how you have ende@@ av@@ oured to have yourself in your younger years .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language , which are spoken in parts of Brazil , as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kw@@ adi &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Com@@ fortable , or sl@@ oth , which you feel after a cold day in the sun . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bir@@ ds own words from his blog in :
they dis@@ sem@@ inate other cultures , reveal another thought of thoughts and cur@@ ios@@ ity our cur@@ ios@@ ity .
sometimes , you influence how we analyze the world to analyze and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page even more of this &quot; un@@ eas@@ ible &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impres@@ sively these small languages are .
Red@@ ner of the &quot; Treasure Languages , &quot; which are much appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able are invited to upload their favourite words here .

the Women &apos;s March on 21 . January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo of the Sah@@ ar Hab@@ ib G@@ ha@@ zi .
in January I participated in the Women &apos;s March on the Women &apos;s March San Francisco in San Francisco .
I trusted her my four year old daughter , she tru@@ sts to me her children : she is my rock in the surf .
in the one minute we call par@@ ol@@ es for the rights of women .
in the next sk@@ id we add rights for trans@@ gender .
we are located in a sea of rain@@ forests and people , some keep the ic@@ onic picture of a woman with head cloth high , bound from a American flag , other sk@@ en@@ code par@@ ols against Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my gir@@ l@@ friend look at me , says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things do not concern yourself , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Mus@@ lim@@ a ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ask me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already run these entertainment .
people who have been working or people who know me since years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar who they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which was built in its presentation .
you de@@ formed me .
there are 1,7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
we will identify themselves to be a Muslim , in different art . but somehow we all plug@@ ged into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is well constructed in our collective presentation , that as Muslims , which can not be rein@@ for@@ ated there , can be mus@@ li@@ zed .
to be de@@ formed
I will not stand alone .
this is even the poet , whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what pictures are in the sense when you think about him ?
love ?
peace ?
when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am , he was an orthodo@@ x mus@@ cular pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , Kor@@ an and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the center of his poetry .
but in the western point the religion was cleared by Rum@@ is , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ etion makes a great part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another exists in the reduction images of Muslims who would col@@ oni@@ alize the western books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting image is determined by the dark man that should be afraid , and the exotic woman that should be saved .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid employed the story behind these pictures in the 1970s .
but these pictures also occur today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood have still stopped .
I &apos;ve been working in the news industry for thirteen years and I have seen how this powerful , faul@@ ty Nar@@ rative has domin@@ ate our news@@ feeds .
this Nar@@ rati@@ v reveals the reality that has led nine Muslim women to their countries during the last three decades , while the United States could not even chose their first female presidential candidate .
this Nar@@ rati@@ v failed to recogn@@ ise that if French , Muslim women are forced to carry out their head@@ scarf in public buildings , Muslim women through their government to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same coin .
a mighty group practices its &quot; control &quot; on the other .
this severe Nar@@ rati@@ v weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements for change .
it looks away that the first Muslim prayers were spoken in American soil by Afri@@ kan@@ ers , who were brought about this way with slave merchants .
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er Muslims .
this sc@@ r@@ ent@@ ine has occupied our collective pre@@ ference force der@@ art deep and def@@ ective that often S@@ ik@@ h men and children are to become tim@@ est@@ ial attacks and labelling .
because of these stories we tell and because of the kind where we tell them , Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; other . &quot;
to the 1.7 billion belong
in the news industry we do more than just tell stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ rative , who help us to understand the world .
and my industry is f@@ ooth@@ say@@ ful to capture the Nar@@ rati@@ v of the 1,7 billion .
and we have failed here where seven million Muslims , which make up the highest degree of religious group in America in the highest degree .
more than one @-@ third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ ham@@ mer@@ ed Americans .
six out of ten American Muslims belong to the immig@@ rants of the first generation that come from 77 countries .
the parents of the writer was in New York in 1976 .
use approved .
four decades ago , my parents arrived in New York to live their American dream .
my mother laid her first jew@@ ellery design in 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; Wol@@ ken@@ krat@@ zer were made possible by the Muslim , American station of Bangladesh , with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
back then , when Khan was re @-@ thought the Sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were indig@@ ated Muslims and Americans .
but am I now called Mus@@ lim@@ a and American ?
sometimes , when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork meat , I say - instead of my Muslim recipes , or to carry my hand@@ some hand@@ ker@@ ch@@ an who wear all Muslims with respect - &quot; from respect to Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I kid@@ ding , we do not wear all T@@ ash@@ enk@@ or@@ ane with us .
we also have to be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be selected for an additional security checks at the airport .
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim schol@@ ars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who ende@@ av@@ our to fight widespread lies over Islam .
these lies are produced on the current volume of a well @-@ lubric@@ ated Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia with money supply , think tanks and experts for fal@@ seh@@ ood , which is our already def@@ ective image , which is a Muslim ; or what Islam is , manip@@ ulated .
because of the stories we tell us and because of the species , in which we tell them , Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is in more than just a stranger , who doesn &apos;t leave the head@@ scarf in more than just a stranger .

Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia in its ug@@ ly forms takes our affili@@ ation .
it takes care of our identity , so far it is so far , so versatile and versatile , that they can fit in a drawer .

use approved .
I want to explain that .
I was born as Mus@@ lim@@ a , but a Mus@@ lim@@ a was born only when I was four years old when I was four years old in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
if soci@@ ologist describe religious life , they attack the following terms : believ@@ ing , Beh@@ avi@@ or and affili@@ ation .
my Muslim faith and behavi@@ ours are perhaps not visible , but they are there .
perhaps my gir@@ l@@ friend , my neighbour , my neighbour to see my rock in the surf , that I am Mus@@ lim@@ a , when it could see through the 15 meters concrete and air that could separate our houses .
she would see the all@@ usion rit@@ ual with my daughter when I kept them in my arms , and you know the Arab verses to protect the coral and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
every of them I repeat three times .
I think that they are protected from evil , the evil which you can see and see the evil which can &apos;t be seen .
my Muslim faith is probably not visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow .
the grand@@ mother of the author , when she wins a Ik@@ eb@@ ana contest in Kar@@ achi , with their sisters sometime in the 1960s .
use approved .
affili@@ ation is the image of my matern@@ al grand@@ mother with their sisters , as they win a competition of art of flower arranged in Kar@@ achi about decades ago .
it is the picture of you that I close my eyes when I slept my eyes : nano , surrounded by their finished and un@@ finished paintings of Su@@ fi , and a basket with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , which it can be virtually impossible .
Mus@@ lim@@ a to be to speak the prayers that she had said to me , if I have a bad day .
Mus@@ lim@@ a is to be in it , as she hath taught me to refer to God , Allah , Mi@@ an , what God means , my only lord .
for a people that - over the centuries - through a &quot; imperi@@ um &quot; colonial , which founded a company with the de@@ cent British Ost@@ ini@@ dien company , it has a deep significance , God , to mention my only lord .
the author was founded in 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
affili@@ ation means to grow and hear that men do not weep , but at the same time , my dar@@ ed grandfather cri@@ es .
in the middle , while he writes about the modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir@@ s , N@@ ana J@@ aan lived around his family in the east of India , who were not able to close his arms within half a century .
belonging to know , there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , whose families , as in my grandfather , were torn apart from col@@ oni@@ alists , who have divided the Muslim world as at the game risk .
Mus@@ lim@@ a to be to know that in the last two centuries , Europeans have all been al@@ igned to four Muslim lands . &quot;
it means that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of the story was dropped by a Muslim country in front of a century .
it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , an in@@ dish , k@@ asch@@ ical subject of British Empire , was called &quot; dangerous &quot; from the newspapers of his time as &quot; dangerous &quot; when he led the first mosque in England .
even before the planes gave , he travelled into more parts of the world than I ever was and preaching the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

to my Muslim tribe of the 1,7 billion , we go deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ plug@@ ged history .
it means that fourteen years ago the most powerful military of the world , with forces that were scattered over every continent apart from Antar@@ c@@ tica to pursue weapons of mass destruction , who did not exist .
it means that more than half million Iraq in Iraq were buried under the ruins of the war .
an American Mus@@ lim@@ a means to know that the self @-@ moral decline in veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 per cent since 2001 .
it means that if a tragedy is home to the USA and the susp@@ ects , a Muslim name , bears the story four times more than a story with a white attack .
it means that four hundred years ago the first prayer call , Az@@ aan , was called by a free black slaves called Bil@@ al .
it means that two hundred years ago an African Islam@@ ist schol@@ ar called Bil@@ ali Muhammad and was brought into this country .
it means Mal@@ col@@ m X to name an American hero .
it is the warmth which I feel when people filled the airports to fight against the Muslim B@@ an .
it is hope that I feel when we stand for our dreams , and when we say black life .
an American woman , a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ erin , a k@@ asch@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Mus@@ lim@@ a and a journalist who contra@@ cted the inher@@ ent inter@@ sec@@ tional@@ ity of ours with multiple d@@ ashes , but to failure to communicate with others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Nar@@ rati@@ v of the 1,7 billion has more possibilities than a magic cubes , but is represented in the reducing branches &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a mother to be a mother , me to give me my child and all the Muslim children , well @-@ knowing that ma@@ ison@@ ous and privileged individuals to build on this spar@@ ity structural Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia .
structural Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is established in the Muslim registry , which began with President Bush and under President Obama .
it is in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists in the immig@@ rant , who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it consists in a country that closes its borders on people from just the countries which it bom@@ bed .
it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; No @-@ Fly list , &quot; which broad@@ casts largely Arab@@ s and Muslims .
we are the wars which we lead and throw bombs that we throw on Muslim countries .
because of the stories we tell and because of those who do not tell us , we are here today .
in a study entitled Asc@@ ent of Man , the scientists of the North@@ western University participants showed a scientifically described picture and desired it to assess groups on a scale of 1 to 100 as regards evolution .
Muslims received the least score .
the conversation we must lead
we are too deep dar@@ ing to be a Muslim or the other &quot; other . &quot;
we stand back in decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the lack of dangerous expres@@ sive prints which we stopped in our news editorial actions .
at least , there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims in the media industry , trying to capture our multiple with d@@ ash and forgotten story .
the po@@ d@@ cast lake Som@@ e@@ thing , Say Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the Pod@@ cast # Good@@ b@@ lim@@ bad@@ o ; a initiative , multiply Muslim authors to print and Ms Mar@@ vel , the Pak@@ ist@@ ani , Muslim , American Super@@ hel@@ din - all this makes me hope .

but I am concerned about this difficult global time point in which we are located .
and that moment , consequences , which go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is a reason that conspi@@ racy the@@ or@@ ists existed in the dark corners of the internet , now the White House .
they are exp@@ on@@ ential since they have made Muslims with &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has grown exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally by being created the &quot; other &quot; .
a few years ago it had not been given them ; now they have ruled great areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the re@@ alities and history of which I was not aware of when I was so old as it is now my daughter , but that made me today to an unknown Mus@@ lim@@ a .
things I left here like a bread volume lane in my speech .
things that might wake up memories , because in all the inter@@ sec@@ ections that make our humanity , likes a story , where som@@ eb@@ ody is made to one another . &quot;
just now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley will find conversation within the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia .
more than a hundred academ@@ ics speak about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; structural rac@@ ism and &quot; American mil@@ itar@@ ism . &quot;
these are no terms that we are usually able to throw ourselves in our schools or read our newspapers in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why do I understand this here at this T@@ ED@@ X Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where nonetheless Edward S@@ aid , the man who has shown us how to be brought wars and people through the pro@@ clamation of the &quot; other &quot; in the public screening , four decades themselves scientist of Stan@@ ford .
we have to ask ourselves in@@ comfortable questions after the role of what , deliber@@ ately and un@@ aware the &quot; other &quot; to conce@@ al , as it is my gir@@ l@@ friend , in which we did not make a new future , while he had already bom@@ bed countries and &quot; to others &quot; people hit , far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts with all of us .
initiative of nar@@ rative art wants to preserve urban diversity
history of history , of Fli@@ ck@@ r users Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 license .
can there be a way , here and now in spite of a voice barrier to appear with someone else ?
for Steven Bird and Ro@@ by@@ n Perry , founder of the initiative Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) is the creation of stories in their original language a possible response to it .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about a different initiative of Steven Bird , the Un@@ translated blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not written on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is a try to obtain the spra@@ ying diversity of great cities .
in fact , in urban areas like in Melbourne and Darwin in Australia , or in Oak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already carried out events since 2015 , the risk that small and not very small languages are not given to the new@@ born children .
for the M@@ acher of the project :
the mass mortality of the world can be avoided , if we do cities that have di@@ vers@@ ität - safe rooms , where people must not forget to belong to them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; during &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listen to understand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to understand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to estimate , to make it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , history accum@@ ulates their history at first in their own language and explain it to English .
even if the participants are no professional history of history , their dev@@ otion and their representation is that the au@@ dien@@ ces can be joined to it .
they call laugh@@ ter and emotions out , the language is no longer a barrier .
for example , the following video shows a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language of D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the history of history of R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou offer also the opportunity to clari@@ fy the cultural customs of the nar@@ rator .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the barrel of the bun@@ ni@@ es and the sp@@ ouse in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
after being declared the significance of his f@@ uses , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara asked , &quot; How is this to speak to an audience , that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a wide Gr@@ in@@ sen , he shares his feeling of cl@@ usi@@ vity :
you have heard !
they were atten@@ tive ...
they were all with me !
to date , the events of Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to extend this . all that are inspired by the project can organize with T@@ LS in touch to organize their own history of history .
Puerto Rico calls for the United States to re @-@ establish the state debt
with the aim of a new investigation into the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounted to 72 million US dollars , the March 3 , 2017 , took several religious and civil organisations in a mass demonstration ; the march started at the pu@@ er@@ tor@@ ic@@ onic Capit@@ ol , the government building , and went up to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
called &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano p@@ or la Au@@ dit@@ or@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( ci@@ vic front for the neur@@ ons of debt ) and the Ö@@ com@@ en@@ ish Church meeting Puerto Ric@@ os .
the advoc@@ ate of the new debts of debts have also submitted a petition to the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto Ric@@ os is that the politicians , banks and government authorities that are responsible for the debts are responsible for their corruption .
we call for a financial exam and a Ste@@ ering Committee without personal interests to public debts , with a firm , our working conditions corresponding fees , which is ag@@ ated in favor of the economy .
we are pressed and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto Ric@@ os is ref@@ using to pay an debt , which is not their .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pension@@ ers will not be able to re@@ locate pension payments .
we require immediate action .
the island - not in the state of state in the USA - suff@@ ers from a serious financial crisis .
hence , the so @-@ called &quot; Center for New Economy &quot; is an independent non @-@ profit organization without party citizenship with a focus on the soci@@ o@@ economic development , a law on state responsibility as an alternative to existing public view .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto R@@ os requires a broad restructuring of state infrastructure .
the measures imposed by the outside will be charged without the participation and convic@@ tion of the citizen who refused to be rejected by the people .
the demonstration took the name &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :
demonstr@@ ators prepare for the march .

the Syrian web@@ developer Bas@@ le Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi , has been missing for more than a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and members leave the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions which he has provided for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : PU@@ BL@@ ICA , the annual conference for digital culture that will be hosted in Berlin , dedicated to a event of the # Free@@ Bas@@ sel campaign .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a Scientific Director in France based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , Managing Director made by so @-@ called &apos; Book Spr@@ ints &apos; finished books within three to five days , l@@ ases Ex@@ pul@@ s from the book cost of Freedom : a Colle@@ ctive Indi@@ c@@ ation ( The cost of freedom : a collective research ) .
the book , which was published last year and is freely available here , contains a series of essays that deal with free culture in the face of op@@ pression .
it is a homage to Bas@@ le and its work .
in the introduction it is :
this book wants to discuss how movements for free knowledge are being built and what are the true cost to which this is connected .
activ@@ ist , artist , designer , researchers , researchers and authors contributed to the movements of freedom of freedom , have been working on site to view over the fog which gives our news@@ feeds and to create something of our various experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers , which has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012 .
his name was deleted from the A@@ dra @-@ prison directory , which he sat on October 3 , 2015 .
since then we have no information on its present state or position location .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that would like to release his release and to know him back in his normal life and in freedom .
to see how Bas@@ le has a high price for his participation in a free culture , has many of us begin to thinking about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , actions and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what have we decided for ?
what did we use extreme belie@@ fs in this process ?
the Web@@ developer of Open Source and Digital activ@@ ist has been in detention since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bas@@ le was transferred to the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution which was transferred to an unknown place .
his wife , the writer and lawyer in N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi reported that the &quot; Military Police Bas@@ sel had taken on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; given by the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported that it was contacted on November 12 , 2015 by individuals who submitted themselves as Insider of the Assad government and had informed of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
however , his position and condition remains unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel played a decisive role that access the internet and to the knowledge of the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist , and currently transmitted the ladder of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project which founded Bas@@ sel , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of the Bass@@ a cultural prototypes have been fo@@ ret@@ ched as the work which he started with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually constru@@ ct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ m@@ yr@@ as .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the crossing of numerous civ@@ il@@ izations and mer@@ ging Greek @-@ Roman architectural types with hi@@ es@@ ful traditions and Persian influences .
Bas@@ le could not know that ten years after he started working with this work , the IS would put everything to it , this architecture that does not only em@@ bodies the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens , but the world em@@ bodies .
this stra@@ pping into digital archae@@ ology and the maintenance has created a time capsule which will be for the public as well as scientists and artists in the future of un@@ estimated value .
as a result , Bas@@ sel was not able to close this project until now .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband , his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I have spent all my life , a lot of freedom to dream and Bash@@ an taught me to emb@@ race them .
I have overcome when I call his name .
Bas@@ le brought to me English , even when he was already in prison .
I learned to read English well , to write and speak English .
he always has his knowledge of shared with everyone who has asked . he has taught other opponents to read and speak English .
Bas@@ le has opened the gate to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he has also taught other in@@ ventions such as computers ut@@ ili@@ ze computers at least theore@@ tically that they actually held a in their hands .
G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Warten ) , a pro@@ clamation , which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 , when he was in prison .
Bas@@ sel and N@@ our@@ a have worked together in the book for a year .
she sailed his texts to him when she visited him , and he translated them from the Arab into English .
this book is available free .
book covers Y@@ ous@@ sef Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It is happening &quot; :
it is happening at every visit ,
that I bl@@ ush in the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose the mind at the moment , in which we emb@@ race us ,
that any of the d@@ angers doesn &apos;t matter to me ,
each of the f@@ ences , chains and gu@@ ards
I forget the plaque of the prison
and I bow in every detail of your voice and words
which I bear with passion in my passion ,
if your eyes say goo@@ db@@ ye
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to get all the moments ,
and to weep for your absence , and to smile .
I bear witness that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the detention of Bas@@ le wrote G@@ ha@@ zi :
a year for@@ gets , my soul
while while
I am in your cage ,
and you are still In the cage of Monster
Bass@@ el &apos;s history is not unique in Syria .
according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) , since the beginning of the protests in 2011 ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) , over 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared .
those who have been arrested or executed under violent application by the regime , tor@@ tured or even executed .
according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International have died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Sy@@ rer in prison since 2011 .
the stories of many more people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community requests the release of Bas@@ le since 2012 .
today we repeat our demand in hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Moz@@ ambi@@ que : due to corruption convicted director following detention office once again in previous post
Mos@@ ambi@@ ans re@@ acted with wrath on a corruption , where a government member returned after half of his sentence to the workplace in the state , on which the corruption was celebrated .
this is a Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and detained in 2010 along with four other def@@ endants due to failure of 54 million met@@ ic@@ al ( approximately 800 000 euros ) for 22 years in prison .
the money came from public funds at the airports of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , whose Council was CFO between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 because of good guidance and called immediately his re@@ attitude to the company , which happened on April 19 .
in accordance with a position of At@@ tor@@ ney General At@@ tor@@ ney of the Republic , which evalu@@ ates the application , there wouldn &apos;t be no obst@@ acle for Cam@@ b@@ aza , to return to his old position as the company had no discipline .
however , many inhabitants are not so good .
the Centre for Public Integration ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , shortly C@@ IP ) , a local institution that sets itself for public transparency , condemned the company to re@@ ject the director in an interview with the Deutsche Welle :
represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the absence of transparency and is even a step towards the efforts of our legal system , so the C@@ IP .
what we need to know is that the company would have to introduce a discipline infr@@ in@@ gement proceedings against the assignment .
however , the company kept silent and conce@@ aling no adequate legal steps for applying the corresponding functions .
Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Mos@@ ambi@@ que social media , re@@ jects this behavior as well as &quot; contra@@ cted &quot; :
when Cam@@ b@@ aza was a competent type , he would have been advis@@ er after being sentenced to prison and to eat half of them .
he could pay lectures and motiv@@ ating words , he could advise and polishing his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he in@@ hib@@ ited to be integrated into the company which he saved damage .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza is glad@@ ly paid for his silence .
resist@@ ible !
bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ ambi@@ ans and student of political science in Brazil says the director no mor@@ als :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was rewarded by the state because he has ins@@ ul@@ ted him , I can &apos;t believe someone in such a way that the state has already off@@ ended this state .
Cam@@ b@@ aza is missing the Mor@@ al to return and serve the state , * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but has only served in the state instead .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was used to state the state as a hand @-@ free money supply and the state itself is tired of being tired who was un@@ loaded and killed in a long prison sentence .
hon@@ est@@ ly , I don &apos;t know why this man was rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te preferred it to remember the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remind you that a thief was in prison :
th@@ iev@@ es belong to the prison Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el only as the first independent president in memory , but also as a sharp , single @-@ cutting and - Inci@@ dentally , proph@@ et@@ ric Red@@ ner .
one of his most famous oral represent@@ ations was , when he confirmed that &quot; an ambitious man is , even the pat@@ ern@@ land for its amb@@ itions , its own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not so . he changes the tac@@ tic , but he doesn &apos;t turn off his amb@@ itions .
an ambitious man is criminal . &quot;
the reactions were also cancelled in Twitter :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison , and he sat in prison for 10 years .
and today the company places the company where he was ar@@ ising from the contract , again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ OM@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - Som@@ i@@ ously igno@@ red ( @ az@@ e@@ _ Raf@@ ik ) May 12 , 2017

Facebook has blocked the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cen@@ sored for many users
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; signi@@ fies K@@ ich@@ er@@ erb@@ se or sp@@ ies .

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their Post@@ s from the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although more about the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to assign to people on East indi@@ an origin or generally rather than ad@@ j@@ ec@@ tively . &quot;
fac@@ i@@ fying the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or ( in Augsburg Scripture ) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of the hate language in Burma in the social network .
over the last years , the rise of radical national@@ ist movements has given an extremely se@@ wer@@ age to the word .
in particular , it is a word that mostly used by Ultra national@@ ists as a hate speech against Muslims who is a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in the effort to tackle speech in Myanmar , the company has licensed a quantity of sen@@ sible content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; today may normally be associated with rac@@ ism , but the word on itself is not calling to hate speech .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that Post@@ s , in which they have discussed the use of the word or doub@@ ts for purposes of his use , cen@@ sored .
in addition there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with basic varieties that have the same accounting sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , it is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese even &apos; Kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; which contains the same letters , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( sp@@ lin@@ age ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( Kam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ ky A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the various mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post of any of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends on the spiritual kind , whether they would like to alle@@ vi@@ ate his back pain as he made a word .
the sentence K@@ U la - &quot; Healing &quot; ( K@@ U ) + the Fra@@ ge@@ word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different .
there were various reactions to the Facebook initiative .
Z@@ in Win H@@ oses is the opinion that they must decrease assets of radical national@@ ists , but also stressed that Facebook must be analy@@ tic before it wants to distribute Facebook in the suspected hour of rac@@ ism .
Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it sh@@ ook the word automatically .
the automation is not understood what you are writing on fac@@ t@@ ook .
what should make it instead , is carefully to analyze the post and check it by checking the words mentioned in the next words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar Ht@@ ine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the good is that this three @-@ party national@@ ists who dis@@ sem@@ inate hate language , have been preserved a quite good lesson .
now it &apos;s time to circumc@@ ise their national@@ ism .
while the action is able to send a strong signal to everyone who dis@@ sem@@ inate hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experience of social networks in China like S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of whi@@ ps often have a kiss and mouse game , whereby the user &apos;s social networks are simply start to use a new word or an alternative written word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to delete his post when he wanted to tell his friends , that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is banned from the social network :
... when I was atten@@ tive to this new directive of Facebook , I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is blocked .
ir@@ on@@ ically my post was removed from Facebook and I was asked to tell me the post and parts of content for 24 hours because the post &quot; Facebook community standards not de@@ ferred . &quot;
Facebook has a variety of posters that have no negative inten@@ tions or that simply try to show their opinions on the role of a radical national@@ ist .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post has been removed , who has nothing to do with Hass@@ elt :
post without hate speech by Facebook .
in the post he shared his opinion about why extreme national@@ ism and religious foundations are bad in the land .
Chan my@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook would have more to do more than the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet Community in front of the beginning of the initiative :
Facebook likes a good intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma by their platform , but it doesn &apos;t work .
such words to be cen@@ sored shall only bring more hat@@ red within the different communities .
it seems that if they have started this without local context or technical support , and so words like &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; pe@@ sen@@ curr@@ y &quot; have prohibited .
even when they found out that they had made mist@@ akes , they tried not to am@@ end the deleted postal address .
if they had just a little more respect for the 15 million benefit who had a great turnover , it would be great .
Fac@@ eb@@ ooks automatic c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship has donated for a lot of bul@@ ky amongst the users .
instead of taking seriously , users are funny now on Facebook and write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if your postcards are taken from the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook Post@@ s , who had no hate language , but still removed :
with permission used .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to sit on a throne and watch a pe@@ op@@ curr@@ y and a Indian movie . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just to try out whether Facebook contains the post which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;

over the past five years , extreme national@@ istic ide@@ ologies and religious foundations , social networks have used to extend their voices and their influence .
among other things , the language of social networks in the municipalities in Myanmar is said to be in charge in Myanmar , especially in the Rak@@ h@@ ine region , where disp@@ utes between Muslims and Budd@@ hist@@ s have been forced to escape .
Facebook has been critic@@ ized for his convic@@ tions , critic@@ izing host@@ ilities in his Bur@@ m@@ ese pages under control .
but rather than just to analyze the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have better been running to context than on code concentr@@ ating initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is concluded with the children &apos;s face
a wedding ring in the sand .

the children &apos;s face is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , Parliament of the country unanimously decided to offer a law , which should offer this practice , so that the age @-@ ready age is now at 18 .
in front of this change of marriage , some members continued du@@ istic and mus@@ cular religion . at that time , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mah@@ ar@@ aj , a group called the representative of the various religious groups of the country , that the state should not be mixed as the State did not ask for maturity . &quot;
this happened , regardless of the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago has defined a contractual partner of the United Nations Convention on Human Rights , the min@@ ors , under 18 years of age . &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of the children who were married to 15 were married , in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago 2.8 percent , and at 18 there were 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the Federal Central Office of the country , that of 1997 @-@ 2007 , more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 .
online @-@ pet@@ itions and social media movements , which were forced to abol@@ ish laws to the children &apos;s face , followed by the foot and enjoyed great support . und@@ ou@@ bt@@ edly , they helped them to bring this result .
nevertheless it was not all smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Hin@@ du @-@ guide , for example , had no concerns , to tell the critics of the children &apos;s face , they should be dam@@ ned to care for their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of religious opposition made for st@@ resses in this actually un@@ complicated cause , and some doub@@ ts came to whether the opposition would agree to the bill .
but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill was decided against the children of children - in spite of 4 Sen@@ ators ( one woman ) of the opposition and an independent that abst@@ ained - so that he could discuss in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would do it to the law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , only the President of the country must vote and declare the law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the country &apos;s Sen@@ ators gave a status update which read Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle to Inst@@ ag@@ ram again :
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence R@@ amb@@ har@@ at : bill of bill against the children of Child was decided at the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes in favour and not only one single counts .
after having been decided in the Senate in the Senate , the draft may now be appointed to the law .
the majority of the social media user was thr@@ illed because the laws of the children of children were finally changed .
Facebook , member Lov@@ ell Francis , who dressed in the Ministry of Education in the Ministry of Education , said :
it has needed too much time and unnecessary Ger@@ ede , which has veil@@ ed the nu@@ cle@@ us of the thing , but do you know what ? the children &apos;s before is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago almost every price .
while Abel Jackson , the opinion it was definitely long enough to abol@@ ish practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas survived that the day had finally arrived :
public Status Update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , , Excellent news !
the Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for that - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( W@@ I@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society that says quite openly about it , how important the adoption of the law was noted :
the married age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the amendment to the Change Conference today was adopted on 9 June 2017 .
there are 41 de@@ pu@@ ties and 35 of them were present at the vote .
all members who were contrary to the law have approved for the law .
the children &apos;s face is not allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long battle ( ... ) # Chil@@ d@@ age@@ ous child@@ birth .
many thanks to all activists who have exposed him .
congratulations to you .
a thank you to our members .
yet a possible hook occurs in the form of Sat Mah@@ ar@@ aj , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan , Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du organization of the country .
prior to months , Mah@@ ar@@ aj announced his intention to company judicial steps , should then be adopted the law , and it seems to be able to redeem his promise .
during the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al @-@ wi , a author of the law meant , it was quite righ@@ tly justified when Mah@@ ar@@ aj would like to proceed against the law , most of the social media users would wish to do the debate on the subject differently .
Patri@@ cia Wor@@ rel@@ l suggested :
Dear Sat , when we say , instead of the discussion so commonly , in a way we would like to talk about the problem that we would say that they might need to worry about the state that they might need of large , persistent men who need to be mis@@ used , &quot; would you be ready to carry out the discussion ?
or do you believe that there is no problem ?
however , whether it comes to an accus@@ ation against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where the children &apos;s before in different gra@@ dations are legally or to the norm though there are laws , which they say .

on Sunday morning , the local News Service Y@@ ar@@ News announced that they were min@@ ced .
by the mirrors of websites , Turkish users can view more Wikipedia content
the English @-@ speaking Wikipedia page was presented on January 18 , 2012 , as opposed to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IPA . copyright in the United States , internationally dar@@ kened .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
since more than one month , Turkey un@@ lock the popular and at the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pe@@ dia Wikipedia .
day of day it is clear how important the platform for users can be helpful as well as reliable information and share reliable information .
both students as well as re@@ porter and fans of TV series against the pl@@ ywood .
although many techniques were used to use conversion tools for block pages ( a current article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ valence in the world ) , most unusual Wikipedia users will not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been subject to Wikipedia articles from Wikipedia , as recently published in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University has been posted regular block@@ ings of the Internet since 2007 after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
after China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of Wikipedia .
while the platform continued to remain closed , there are several Mir@@ ror@@ sites ( pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and often updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform put all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centr@@ alized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( so calcul@@ ator machines ) based on the system of domain and thus making a complete c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship difficult .
the content is available in spite of legal prohibition .
in a blog report IP@@ FS on his efforts :
after we have heard the news ( over the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we put everything to put snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . so the option is to read the contents on de@@ centr@@ alized and distributed manner .
this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ di@@ a.@@ org website .
IP@@ FS also announced that this step is independent of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it only deals with screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Vik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .
Crist@@ ian Con@@ sol@@ i from Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a Mir@@ ror from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open @-@ source project that everyone can use to make similar Mir@@ ror pages when exposed to the respective country where Wikipedia is closed .
Con@@ sol@@ i reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i - Global Vo@@ ices as well as collabor@@ ator with Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i &apos;s Open Medal &quot; Pod@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a proxy address , a Mir@@ ror .
you take it to another URL which is not the original . that what you see then is from Wikipedia .
essentially the server direc@@ ts the request to the right Wikipedia page so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia themselves if they are blocked in Turkey .
for this is executed by a server that is not in Turkey .
a ne@@ ak@@ es@@ ian game photographer uses his camera to atten@@ tive to the need for nature conservation

S@@ aus@@ Gir@@ i was with the photos that he looked around , never satisfied . they were w@@ ishing with bad positi@@ onable mot@@ ives and balanced colors .
the motiv@@ ated him to bear himself a camera with themselves and try to gra@@ b the situation .
then he was a child .
today , at the age of 28 , S@@ ion , Nept@@ une was trying to bring an international stage to the international stage .
and his hom@@ etown right next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , it offers the perfect opportunity to shoot photos , that &apos;s attention to Nept@@ une Animal World .
he described on Facebook , like this first @-@ class position in his work helps :
I live at the edge of the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could it give better for a passionate wild photographer ! !
I rested from home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida ) called me . he had received a call from my father to get a le@@ op@@ ard on the banks of the Rap@@ id River .
the river dam@@ m is just a few minutes from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I went with my camera and was there in a few minutes there .
my father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the Leopard was , and I immediately began to Kni@@ p@@ sen pictures ! !
we aim to achieve a co @-@ operation with the authorities to obtain worldwide recognition for Nep@@ als Nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding of that wild animals are not so fur@@ ious , as they look like .
and he ought to know , because he rose already from face to face , saying ,
a tiger can not be bo@@ ther@@ ed by the opinion of the sheep not when sleeping ! !
late evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
also I was in the way home when the king of the bush appeared , and immediately the king of the bush appeared . he immediately push@@ es us , we see us , and he star@@ ved me through the S@@ al @-@ trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , S@@ elling the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos .
his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ als Nature and game is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , and lived mostly in a tent to make pictures of Ot@@ ter in Bar@@ dia National Park recordings of Ot@@ ters . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and live six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near tourist shel@@ ters .

this entry was posted by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ unte@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community organisation from India .
a revised version was re @-@ published here as part of an Content Sh@@ aring Convention .
in many parts of India there are women with the greatest care , the names of their hus@@ bands , or even from older men in the family .
instead they use a p@@ onom@@ en or tell &quot; father of my child . &quot;
of Ch@@ is@@ is@@ gar@@ h to Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra and Ut@@ t@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h give women to respect her husband &apos;s social pressure , as well as the fear of the consequences they should mis@@ use the norm to do this practice in life .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condemned to the Indian state of O@@ il@@ a by a hom@@ osexual acts and was cast away by her family and the village community after having addressed a secret relations with names .
tradition of their wives is not to be called by the name , but also among men are widespread . however , they have far less assignment assign@@ ments if at all , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , among them health professionals and house@@ wives , were therefore fast to the main round of the city .
it is a place just for them alone , in which they discuss the host@@ ility of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate and discuss .
as one of 56 clubs , which there are in 13 Indian states , it is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the community video Vol@@ unte@@ ers and uses himself for dismant@@ ling the patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was working for seven years with the help of their video camera at the discovery of practices , like children &apos;s he@@ aters up to the Verb@@ al of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS players , and heads these clubs .
it is reported how these clubs have created a secure place for those women and made them at the same time to ambassador of the wall .
the first video , showing the Roh@@ ini in her discussion group , did not win their hus@@ bands at the name of their names .
it has decided for this issue because they wanted to open a talk about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves .
nor to arrange the names of their hus@@ bands according to their hus@@ bands , a custom , whom they have found out all the obligations and have never been question@@ ed .
Roh@@ ini believes :
this tradition test@@ i@@ fies that a woman wishes to her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not keep this will be regarded as a hin@@ der than woman without mor@@ als .
the tradition is so deeply ro@@ oted that we never made our discussion round about this discussion group .
at the beginning of the Roh@@ ini , who had never mentioned their husband so far at home , try to try out at home as it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother in law .
Roh@@ ini told :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband weigh still long after the video was ended .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pra@@ k@@ ash , my husband , turned to me , saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I should call him at his name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini started its first discussion club with this self @-@ confidence in Bag@@ gage .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; never before . some believed that there was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family would be protected against girls and women .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in Ut@@ t@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , women tried to bring the discussion with a exercise in gear .
Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , leased , sad , lov@@ ingly and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then they asked them all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us how they want us to respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years , and this was the first day to whom they brought the name of their hus@@ bands on her lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ j@@ on from the village of Wal@@ he in Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra over the Bre@@ chen of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which he married women to speak the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini told :
a woman was so sh@@ y that they only went away during the whole exercise ; another decided to leave the whole fru@@ str@@ ate fru@@ stration against him and his family until they cursed him .
expression on their faces was ek@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
even at the A@@ dr@@ en@@ al@@ in@@ r@@ ush , with an ancient fires , the women decided that they would actually try to name her hus@@ bands in the name .
and they kept their word .
in the next days , Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas they put in the head : his wife could not cease to say his name .
another one member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she joined her , she was afraid , saying that it was an error .
another woman said , &quot; Roh@@ ini said that I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant was fully under@@ stand@@ able and the situation created in violence .
Roh@@ ini reported how women tried to stop other practices , such as the carrying of the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red point at the fore@@ head , which shows the status status :
why only women have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband , that I would carry the petrol point if it is open .
he laugh@@ ed only , and I heard him to bear it .
the other women have not ceased to be stopped , but my , they are now in a better position , even to wear it on some days .
for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their views and goals .
&quot; we make a trip at every discussion club .
normally we packed lunch and water and go out into the field .
I don &apos;t want to make sure that the women could hear what could hear , &quot; says it .
in the last months they celebrated their own birth@@ days for the first time in her life with cake ; they d@@ anced and talked about things about which they had never done before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on this problems for many years and yet have I been working about some things , for example how our ident@@ ities are linked to our hus@@ bands , never been so hon@@ est .
it feels great to say some things according to words , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round we have talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothes .
some women in the group have registered only Sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most it is okay , but some wanted a Sal@@ man @-@ c@@ ta , a large shirt above a tro@@ users , wear it , they have not kept .
after much disp@@ utes and discussion about the advantages of your own clothes selection , the mor@@ als associated with the Sar@@ is and much more , clever Roh@@ ini made their own pair of cur@@ t@@ as ( upper shirt ) into a discussion round , so that women could wear it .
next , they have now decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a in which they can wear Je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure they can do it .
on the question , if in the five months have already changed anything since their first discussion club , Roh@@ ini confirms that the things come slowly into rolling .
we have made only small steps so far .
some women tast@@ ed a few times , but we stopped doing it again to say the name of her husband .
some , including me , make it still , but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved .
only one or two say the names of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now carry Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their fore@@ head .
the women in the discussion group know that changes that they would like to achieve in their lives - like the f@@ eil@@ ing of movement or your own clothes choice - at the end of a difficult to navigate the river .
being able to trust in each other , they will be aware that they sit in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explained :
each of us is a sacrifice of patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am there too .
but this club gives us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that there is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction , if every woman is in the club home and other people tell us what we speak and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .

screenshot from the official YouTube channel of the Beatles .
on 29 June of this year the h@@ ash@@ tag was to be found in the Japanese Twitter trend , where many fans were issued memories and their appreci@@ ation for the Beatles were distributed .
the visit of the Beatles in 1966 in Japan is considered to be in the Japanese culture of post @-@ war period .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , which was inter@@ viewed in London in 1964 , was noted on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the first visit :
for just about five days the Beatles were in the country , but this was enough to rotate the Japanese .
the people here is quite clear that they had no other option than the Beatles received with open arms .
many well @-@ known Japanese sizes had reached its zen@@ ith when the Beatles arrived in Japan in 1966 .
the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , President of the single @-@ trading giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review .
good morning ! . today the Beatles commemor@@ atory was in Japan . it was in Tokyo for 51 years ago .
even today songs of the Beatles have sung songs by the Beatles in Japanese kar@@ a@@ oke bars and in English classes on Japanese central schools .
the kit@@ sch survived all .
today Beatles date is Beatles .
we all love in our house the Beatles .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; Win@@ nie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll of John Lenn@@ on should or not .
and as it belongs to fans , Japanese naturally also make mushroom rides on the known places that stand with the band in connection .
but if you love the Beatles , you are your 5 places you have to visit .
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry F@@ ields ( memorial in New York )
4 ) Penn@@ y Lane
5 ) ( From the link ) The Beatles Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
the mushroom runs may not be l@@ ur@@ r@@ ile enough :
good morning together .
today Beatles date is Beatles .
the Beatles began to Japan exactly today in 1966 .
the characters from the film K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran over Abbey Road .
we did the same last year .
and of course , some companies take advantage of the fan community , such as this R@@ amen Shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ ah@@ iro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! ! today is Beatles memorial day .
and what could that be for one day ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I will listen to me today &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ ES@@ TER@@ DA@@ Y &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and will eat R@@ amen pasta with Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gl@@ atz@@ y men are deported and killed in Moz@@ ambi@@ que and killed
the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia war@@ med the population that believ@@ ing men could be in Moz@@ ambi@@ que &apos;s goal of attacks .

a new system of kidn@@ apped people for trade , probably for super@@ st@@ itious purposes , probably the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambi@@ que . the local government now called a number of operations to life to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was de@@ capit@@ ated and part of the organs were taken from .
two men were arrested and con@@ founded in the sequence that the organs of Sh@@ am@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi are being used .
there will be the local super@@ st@@ ition that the head of a smooth man of gold contains gold , or riches , declared the police show of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia &apos;s BBC .
it is the first time that consecutive attacks on glass became registered in Moz@@ ambi@@ que .
another group , the aim of ex@@ h@@ ort@@ ation for ob@@ sc@@ ure are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to that the UN led a mission in the South African country to investigate these practices .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in neighbouring countries Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight this super@@ st@@ ition and pre@@ st@@ ables .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who have submitted to the country :
attention to a h@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Moz@@ ambi@@ que are aiming for we@@ aning men in Moz@@ ambi@@ que are goal rit@@ u@@ eller attacks , warned the Mos@@ ambi@@ que police after the latest h@@ ort@@ ation of three smooth men , due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the ex@@ h@@ ort@@ ation took place .
Hus@@ hai Al@@ gy Ad@@ amo , student and inhabit@@ ant of the city of In@@ ham@@ lets in the south of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , said that the local police already lost its case :
PR@@ M believes that the Sh@@ aman has been involved in the death of the glass @-@ member men .
the persecution and assassination of smooth individuals for the profit and selling of their organs in Mor@@ amb@@ é@@ zia County , for probably super@@ st@@ itious rit@@ u@@ als , has resulted in the police of the Republic of Moz@@ ambi@@ que ( PR@@ M ) , which also indicates that a faith has existed , according to the victims of the head , the wealth of wealth .
in recent days three men were murdered with hair@@ dressing problems in this part of the country .
Angela Fer@@ re@@ ira Sam@@ an@@ tha shared the chron@@ icle of the blo@@ g@@ gers of the poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa that is clear that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty of which Moz@@ ambi@@ que is opposite :
I would like to ask E@@ IN Moz@@ ambi@@ que , DAS S@@ ICH , a country where the teachers would be ashamed to demand sex against good notes , work and other services to make their bread to make their bread , a country in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor col@@ der for super@@ st@@ itious purposes , or &quot; black magic . &quot; they aim to aim to get to fast wealth .
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenom@@ ena , some of the opportunity for ma@@ th@@ ene humor could not escape .
Zen@@ o Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Moz@@ ambi@@ que and enthusiastic Twitter pres@@ ets , twe@@ ets that both the boss of the Mor@@ c@@ em@@ bal@@ a , Pedro Sap@@ ange , as well as the Poli@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ cher Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , both gl@@ itter@@ ing heads are :

a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably made recently .
this story was originally published on Hong Kong Free Press , July 8 , 2017 .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of in@@ car@@ n@@ ated Chinese dis@@ sidents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has taken attention in the international community after his lawyer had been announced at the end of June that he was hosp@@ ital@@ ized due to liver cancer in the final stage .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( government end@@ anger@@ ed ) , after being involved in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that demands the democratic re@@ forms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal question &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and nar@@ rator , he did it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yet China will continue to give calls to the international community , the Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , Di@@ chter@@ in Li@@ u X@@ ia , or allow a treatment abroad .
while some countries critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have gone out completely to the topic .
Hong Kong Free Press has consolidated some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
arth@@ eid Ra &apos;@@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Commissioner of the United Nations for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to facilitate Li@@ u abroad a treatment .
Norway and Norway
Norway &apos;s prime minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Minister of Foreign Affairs B@@ ø@@ r@@ ge Br@@ ings have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
the relationship between China and Norway got into a Sto@@ cks , after the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government gave it nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were first resum@@ ed in December last year . in June , Norway signed an agreement to record the salmon trip to China , as the exports have been largely blocked since 2010 .
after the message has spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee brought his hope to un@@ conditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment , he was not able to increase its price .
during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a decision on which China was promp@@ ted to release Li@@ u and his wife immediately from the house arrest and allow him to seek medical support where he wants .
the leading diplomatic side of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called Li@@ us to release Li@@ us , as stated in a statement on 30 June :
we are at the same time that China raises all restrictions on Mr. Li@@ us wife and family members .
they are supposed to meet all visits and welcome them who wish them to communicate and be able to communicate free with the outside world .
United States
U.S. ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad issued the Americans that he had the opportunity for the treatment abroad , if it is possible to communicate with it in his enjoy@@ ment . &quot;
an spokes@@ person in the U.S. Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced that the message of the Chinese authorities announced that the message of the Chinese authorities not only allow Li@@ u to free Li@@ u , but also to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from their house arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the withdrawal of US embassy moved to China , with the introduction of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country has the right to be unique and respon@@ sive remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Poland , Pol@@ ley had to offer that China should offer the following :
protection and freedom such as trav@@ ef@@ rei@@ heit and access to the medical care of his choice , based on them according to Chinese Constitution and legal system as well as international obligations .
the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have introduced a decision in the Congress to release the Chinese government on it , Li@@ u and his wife un@@ conditional .
I need China to allow China to release the Nobel Prize Lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , so he can treat himself into a proper medical treatment . ht@@ t@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin hope that Li@@ u needs all the medical support that he needs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o must be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chinese president X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G20 summit in Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources reported in Peking of the news agency Reuters that China had great concerns whether the vort@@ ex could overcome the visit to Hamburg in Hamburg .
Canada to Canada
on June 28 , the Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um asked China to provide a reasonable medical care and to give him the opportunity to leave himself entirely by his family .
Li@@ us An@@ w@@ alt tells AF@@ P before , Li@@ u X@@ ia who could visit him every day , but the police always monitored the room in the hospital , and that it is not permitted to talk with someone outside , including his lawyers to talk and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells us :
Canada calls to China to susp@@ end its international human rights issues , including the expression of expression , and the rights reserved for the exercise of this rights .
France
France &apos;s Foreign Ministry ur@@ ged China in an explanation on June 29 , on behalf of humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures must be taken in order to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o will receive all treatments which he , regardless where , needs . furthermore , his wife and his family may have access to him .
although the news broad@@ caster France info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of State gave no further information if France will eventually take him .
Taiwan
the Council of the Fest@@ land@@ issues in Taiwan called for China on 27 June , Li@@ u exemp@@ t and require a larger tolerance towards those who require peaceful funds to demand political re@@ forms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ator Yu Me@@ i @-@ n@@ u , from the reg@@ imes of the People &apos;s Party , also called China to allow the dise@@ ased intellec@@ tu@@ als Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed herself very concerned in a statement on 28 June at Li@@ u very interested and gave him to pray for Li@@ us prosper@@ ity .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my faith that he participated , that he took and for which he had been strictly punished for a harmon@@ ic , stable and we@@ al@@ thy China , which again has contributed to a peaceful world .
I felt personally and encour@@ ages , when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the Charter 08 signed , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .
license : CC@@ 0 Dom@@ aine Public
is Singapore a city or a country ?
the question may be stup@@ id when Singapore is an international level as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice , K. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am should be considered a town in Singapore .
this re@@ mark triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the International branch of the State of New York , the Minister , that many people critic@@ ized the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because it was compared to Singapore with other countries .
it support that Singapore should be considered a city .
... nobody said in question if New York is a democracy ...
that &apos;s it , with most people commit an error .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the Minister of Justice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to turn the logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and ass@@ ess@@ ments to create this valuable country , we will say that we will not be any country .
it was so vul@@ gar , so vul@@ gar , it had respect to the run of a run before the responsibilities , a mandatory infr@@ in@@ gement .
Singapore if you are not my country , whose land is it ?
the reasons described by Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am were not very Nobel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of its , he appeared in@@ sof@@ tened .
in contrast , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to the cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , as well as cities that are permanently led by a party .
these cities are democratic .
as soon as you reach the core point of the subject , the good old Lei@@ er from the author@@ itarian fe@@ eders could be left to the demo@@ cra@@ b logic , since it fits better to their power .
in the final of the last week of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am gave answers to his American guests regarding our press , our J@@ udi@@ c@@ ative , our political system truly non @-@ answers .
appropriate questions tar@@ ts with non @-@ answers rati@@ onal type .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am to clear his opinion , as they did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country but a city is , so the country belongs to our city ...
short , I understand nothing .
I would be than@@ k@@ ful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am would take up the effort to clari@@ fy this point if he was paid highly paid to be part of the government of Singapore .
by clicking on the blog he published his comment on the reviews that you should start to read the entire tran@@ script of the conference , so that you can understand the context of statements from Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am better , according to which Singapore is a city and no country .
read the heading .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore is rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said why the elections in Singapore would be so important even if we are looking for free and just place elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he earned Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party gain a party ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he didn &apos;t do it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an demonstrates its dis@@ appointment over Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , which makes the leader of a her@@ on @-@ growing generation , a pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
I am about what said the Minister of Justice of Singapore , ...
at least I knew Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old yar@@ n that expected me - be understood with them or not , but this is another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , member of the new generation of the political leader of Singapore , I doub@@ ts and I &apos;m not even sure if he really believes , properly and aware of what he def@@ ends .
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review the weak@@ nesses of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am Arg@@ um@@ ni :
did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am &quot; ben@@ evol@@ ent a mistake &quot; or was it a fre@@ igh@@ te@@ ous spokes@@ man ?
if Singapore is not a country , we will only be considered independent and so@@ vereign state ?
if not , on which country go back to the so@@ vereign rights of the city of Singapore ?
Singapore is unique , it &apos;s equally land and city .
since he plays an important role within the government square , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am plays the serious significance .
why do the people aff@@ ord their military service , defend their country only their country ?
who must pay our Prime Minister invo@@ ices ?
what is the value of our pink head@@ count ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
comm@@ its the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade to the Be@@ ast , Singapore is always a city :
&quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot;
this sentence seems to have much more sight@@ ings of Singapore ...
no one has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we were always a city / island nation .
I can understand that we often hear statements as &quot; the defense of the country in particular &quot; etc . , but this is not quite true .
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .

your answers will be published here as part of a continuing series , with the rum@@ ors of certain parts of the world uncovered and another fac@@ et should be shown .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question that is set to me in Japan : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , and answer me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I live in Japan and again in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on where the situation takes place in the event , it is considered to be cour@@ te@@ ous to show interest in his talk @-@ party by making personal questions .
in my clari@@ fication they are usually followed by default : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice @-@ hockey , nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans may cook without blood before rage when they are held for Americans , but I do not distur@@ b me .
for anyone who doesn &apos;t know , there is little , that differs us from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans put a Canadian flag in their back@@ pack when they travel .
all love Can@@ adi@@ ans .
by contrast , Americans , ... .
so it was already when I began 20 years ago to travel through the world - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before the 11th September .
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always borne little monkey sheets on their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free healthcare !
there are no weapons with us !
the same official marri@@ ages are legal in Canada already since 2005 !
all seem to think , Canada is so great .
we are cour@@ te@@ ous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are obviously very often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exc@@ use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada also applies to ethnic groups as the most toler@@ ated country of ethnic groups .
we are not like these types south of the border .
we are Canadian .
I hate it .
first , I have many American friends , which I ad@@ mi@@ red .
it would not account for me if you would like to change Johnny from Dallas for example .
Marc out of Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
first , being referred to as &quot; nice , &quot; says in fact , sp@@ ie@@ fly , but trag@@ ically , but trag@@ ically un@@ important figure N@@ ed Flanders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has a very own Canadian Doppel@@ gän@@ ger ) .
if Canada really had a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flanders , this would be a step forward . but the real problem exists that &quot; nice &quot; no personality has .
there are no corners and edges , nothing where you can encounter .
harm@@ less , is un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and in@@ interesting to earn no attention .
this can be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , from the things that pass around one .
I would even go far to say that the wish is , free and alone to be a main building of the Canadian .
we tend to take care of our own matters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; is maybe just a cool courtesy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans speak not often over the fence with the neigh@@ bors .
we l@@ acks the warm heart@@ y , open kindness , whom I now connect with my American friends .
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) , Just@@ in Tru@@ de@@ au became the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has Canada truly sexy .
music video of a pop band par@@ odi@@ zed in Thailand Jun@@ ta
one in Thailand famous Pop @-@ Band has published a music video that the Jun@@ ta par@@ odi@@ zed which the power took hold in 2014 , despite its promise to recover the civilian government , continues to re@@ igns .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells about what regulations makes him his gir@@ l@@ friend .
although not explicitly polit@@ ically , the music video refers to the sustained military dom@@ ination of the Jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation in the country .
the video for song was a huge success .
within the first three days the video @-@ loaded video was shared between 1.@@ 254 times and received 8,@@ 800 eyel@@ kes .
last month , the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists the public to view this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entert@@ aining introduction to the Thai policies , in particular , as it remains the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
once again , check out these videos , which relate to some of the political issues that have been tra@@ ced in Thailand in the past three years .
the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; possibly refer to the dra@@ con@@ ical section 44 of the provisional constitution , with the Commander in Chief of the army &apos;s absolute decision to represent significant national topics .
the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program for &quot; Settings &quot; by journalists , students , scientists , activists , policy and other people who can be viewed by the Jun@@ ta as a critic .
the image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime against , whose v@@ age and un@@ clear rules can often be used by the authorities to rep@@ ay activ@@ ist and other critics of the state .

the post @-@ war society re@@ covers only very slow in East Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ros@@ arch@@ al .
it has now been over 20 years since the Geor@@ gian @-@ ab@@ as@@ ian war officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still visible in this part of the republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ anc@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
villages like D@@ zh@@ an@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and Khar@@ chil@@ ava are in the carbon pool of Ab@@ ch@@ Asia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , de@@ position Asia , Geor@@ gier and Armen@@ ians lived and worked in the area together .
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today , the largest part of Russians and Ab@@ ch@@ ases live in the area .
such settlements will also be called in Ab@@ ch@@ Asia .
in the pre @-@ war period there were more than 10.000 people , today there are only a few hundred people in this spirit .
this phenomenon is characteristic of the arch@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district became more than 16,000 people , after having barely increased over a decade .
in 1989 about 43@@ ,000 people lived in this district .

&quot; everything is a consequence of the war &quot;
the empty five @-@ story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , which are called Ch@@ ru@@ ch@@ t@@ ch@@ kov@@ sky , represent symbo@@ lically for the decline and the devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are fallen and very rare , they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village of D@@ zh@@ an@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he starts a conversation and it falls hard to end this .
&quot; it is a consequence of the war . &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; why ?
it is still unique . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens , who had served all the community .
now there is only paved road with all spl@@ end@@ our spl@@ end@@ our buildings .
people who once lived in this place and had their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union , have left the district now .
in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ zh@@ an@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , about fifty inhabitants live .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the ch@@ ru@@ sch@@ ov@@ kas , which is still a or two families , recogni@@ zes in the balconies where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when she dis@@ covering me with the camera in the hand , they draw back immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother is forbidden to photograph us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is simply forbidden , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ per@@ ed to her gir@@ l@@ friend , and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and van@@ ish .
many people work in the area for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ anc@@ arch@@ al@@ ug@@ ol .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence industry ( cultivation of land@@ sc@@ aped products for the own demand ) such as cattle breeding , bee and vegetables .
it is difficult to come on the laps .
the municipal office supplies hot candles and bread for the villages in winter .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cch@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about ten years ago , an older woman moved with the name Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a as they will be called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to the jung@@ le k@@ ha .
in spite of her el@@ dest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left Asia to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ ch@@ Asia . &quot;
Gal@@ ina would like to assume no financial aid from her daughter and insi@@ sted that she supports their young grand@@ son instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly yields are just about 9 dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is too hard to survive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a tells that she and other vill@@ agers try to make regular meetings and public holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
when holidays are , we visit us .
but we can &apos;t do this - everybody is busy with his own problems . &quot;
while she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ asha , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; call A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a to her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said we could arrange Zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I already prepared the floor .
I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; one can get to everything &quot;
together with her husband and the five common children lived G@@ aly@@ as , together with her husband and the five common children in her house for a few days .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day they remin@@ is@@ cent of the life of the war .
despite the relations that live in Central Russia , Oss@@ et@@ ia and Georgia ( the country Ab@@ ch@@ Asia still broke out ) , they did not leave the opportunity to leave it .

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capit@@ ol in Ab@@ ch@@ Asia ) recently .
we want to build a house there , but it will take a little bit more , &quot; she explains it .
Nat@@ ascha receives approximately $ 9 for each child .
her husband works in the coal eng@@ ru@@ be .
the young family has its own farm .
in the vicinity of the house where Nat@@ asch@@ as Kinder@@ garten was once located , they hold pigs , cows , H@@ aly@@ ne and chickens .
it tells that it was initially a very terri@@ fic situation when many people left the village after the war .
but during the time they lost their fears .

&quot; we have no fear of the dark street or a few people .
one can get used to everything .
many people believe that this building had been destroyed during the war .
in fact , it actually has something to do with pill@@ age .
after the war there was hardly work and all lived as it was right .
I remember every day like the city and the war once were . &quot;
when our conversation goes to the end , a little boy ren@@ nt over us .
he runs through the window of a destroyed building and hidden .
a ball is flying out of the window and another boy .
he plays with the ball , then falling down the hill .
a group of children pursu@@ es the ball .
while they run , some of them cast stones upon the ru@@ ined buildings .
these Ru@@ ins are a part of their childhood , who care for imm@@ ac@@ ity in their lives .

in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; houses the migrants on their long voyage
Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez runs a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the State of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken has been published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our Partners PR@@ I.@@ org and appears here with friendly permission .
on the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , some places will be known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he is located on the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is managed by a 59@@ - year old Mexican player , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink Br@@ ill@@ en@@ frame and golden earrings in t@@ ed@@ dy shape .
she is called Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless they know many of the names of Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a goal for Afri@@ cans and Ha@@ iti@@ ans who are on the passage .
the hotel does not have any charm .
for approximately 2,50 dollars the night sleep in simple rooms , with grinding , cr@@ um@@ bled walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .
there is no sign to the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and African migrants are here .
sometimes , wife Ram@@ í@@ rez tells the people in full small bus@@ buses and the upper part of the coast they begin to call : &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you Mama Africa ? . &quot;
at the moment it &apos;s rather quiet but in this year , Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept outside on boxes .
she would not want to be ashamed .
she also helps them and bring them to the hospital when they are sick , they buy them medicines that they do not pay them , it mass@@ aged them with a bal@@ m that exhau@@ sted from a long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebast@@ i@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived at a short time .
I asked him if Mama Africa is a reasonable name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family Sebast@@ i@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a Jo@@ gh@@ ost@@ st@@ ache ) pos@@ ing with Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ kes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel that it is too you that African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebast@@ i@@ ao travels to Boston with his sister , who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
they already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans , who are on the way to the United States , normally a first stop in South America and then move towards the north .
the family had heard from other Weg@@ ers from Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the route , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he tells that Ha@@ iti@@ ans and Afri@@ kaner often travel the route and that Afri@@ cans are already talking on W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
how many of his Weg@@ ener did Michel@@ et lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a builders on the building sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy weak@@ ens , he started his journey into the United States .
he has been a guest of Mama Africa since months : it sells SIM cards to save the required money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ ju@@ ana .
I ask him if he is in the future with Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let them go again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered sm@@ iling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells that their guests often send text messages when they have gone to kiss them or tell you about the course of their journey .
they declared that their Christian faith is the drive of their work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but their guests have taught you to prepare h@@ ens like in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps familiar here , but it is not the only wireless hope for migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city a cu@@ l @-@ lane leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter is Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family moved to their small house .
he is polic@@ eman and found that the bus stop to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive .
he began to help them to get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar the night .
at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Ha@@ iti@@ ans .
some sleep on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cook@@ ery outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests do .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he tells us . &quot; I have experienced what they experience .
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and help others . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support . &quot;
after he lived for three years , he was transferred to the United States after a raid on his office .
the majority of migrants who travels across Tap@@ ach@@ ula is from Central America , other residents open the doors of their houses for them .
José Antonio C@@ ord@@ ova Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he was fled to Honduras with his wife and three children from before men who wanted to make money without a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked an accommodation and an unknown , a all@@ ap@@ ason , has offered him a roof .
a few months later , the family lives and tries to decide where the next steps should go .
back to the house of Mama Africa , everything is full of guests .
in the streets consul@@ ted the travelers quiet of their teleph@@ ones .
a mini@@ bus arrived today and has 20 new guests , most of Somalia .
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy about that her house is full , but it is also nost@@ al@@ gic , because of those who have gone away .
as a proud grand@@ mother hide her in her album with numerous photos .
there are one of her daughter with African hair bra@@ ids that you have made a customer , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .
she laugh@@ s sad , while she is briefly presented to me .
&quot; Habla se fu@@ eron , &quot; repe@@ ats her once every time . &quot; you have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install a surveillance app based on their mobile phone .
there is a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang from Twitter users .
the residents of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic min@@ orities region in the West of China are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phone .
on July 10 , the mobile users in the Ti@@ an@@ shan district of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a mobile phone number in the Ti@@ an@@ shan District in which she indicates the district government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; web cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this release , the app tells you that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must access to terrorist information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that the authorities use the app for more than the fight against terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ fecture , because they had installed the app , messages with a private We@@ chat group .
in the communication of the police , the app wants to determine the sources and the distribution paths of the terror@@ ists and would follow together with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang Website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elecom .
the main function is the blocking por@@ no@@ graphic Websites , online fr@@ aud , Tro@@ ians and Ph@@ ishing sites to support users how much time they will spend online , and to control the own home network .
this app to help the min@@ ors for min@@ ors to help children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can naturally be used in a varied way .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; state player or even h@@ acker could control the home network of a person to manip@@ ulate or from it .
this introduction stands in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
while news about digital c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in China usually lies on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south , the reality is very often dark for those who live in remote ethnic minority regions like X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
to limit the rest and dis@@ satisfaction in the conflict areas , authorities often arrange extreme poverty and surveillance measures as well as rout@@ in@@ ely via internet de@@ position .
the Media @-@ Out@@ let Media Out@@ let &quot; images from the beginning of China &quot; ( which appeared on the link in China , showed photos of a Check@@ point , by the police officers to review the inhabitants optional , whether they have installed the surveillance app .
authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian are sure that people using the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang App .
a mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days .
if you are searching for an Check@@ point using a device without these software , they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for the technological development .
they forced the people to use devices that are intended for elderly people .
this is a form of captivity due to rest technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Images from Route China &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Re@@ quest@@ w@@ ang @-@ Product description &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) also released a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which the software can lift the license re@@ clamation of a Windows operating system , thus receiving un@@ restricted access to the hard drive of the computer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after installation of j@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and cell phones are in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang to electronic handles .
the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may possibly minim@@ ize a reaction to the statements of the city party , to minim@@ ize the dis@@ sem@@ ination of illegal content .
all government branches , authorities and associated institutions , including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security office in operation of their computer and communication devices .
a current report from Freedom House , an US @-@ American Human Rights Organization , also mentioned this new monitoring system :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published a decree on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi a decree with the order to all residents and entrepren@@ eurs , to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ eb@@ ooks and media memory cards &quot; at local police .
the intention is to identify and destroy any of terrorist videos , but this promotion has viol@@ ated the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants , and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole number of other possible Agre@@ ements , including those who refer to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , part 1 : everything scre@@ ams after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

this is the first of six reports in series &quot; sleep or death , &quot; in which the activity is Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane his experiences in a Syrian prison .
far away from our blue , virtual world , you look at and stell@@ o that you are very alone at a place where everything is very important .
everything changed after and after dis@@ band@@ ed and reveals a truth , which is clearly visible , both from inside and outside .
one that makes all glory to her name .
one , which allow themselves to feel in a list of feelings and expres@@ sions , allowing no met@@ aph@@ ors .
but when you come back into reality , you will look behind the scenes - beyond the actors , the beautiful scenes and the actors , the characters in beings from flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death .
all the doub@@ ts are in smoke , and you shall keep your existence , even if the earth is on the axis of evil . you will clear that you are tra@@ pped between the walls , which your parents , and before them have erected your grand@@ parents , stone to stone .
they have arrested me and my father three times , but this was not enough to form@@ ulate &quot; my lesson , &quot; as the chief of the security services - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he established his power over us , while he even destroyed the most sim@@ pl@@ est concepts that we knew .
five young people were destroyed during a peaceful protests such as the dar@@ nel from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it was enough to destroy the city the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; write @-@ cry .
all the urban area cov@@ eted only my own , not only my own .
for the first time it was quiet , rainy , even to the wrong time , even if I had no high demands of a city which is to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their compli@@ ments .
in the third night , things had a little cal@@ ming after the power supply occurred in the quarter .
I cut the silence , while I cried several times &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; out of my house roof .
I heard my voice through the silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt enough to gather together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends yet joined me , and we are united to a splendid picture which my expectations were full and fulfilled .
in such a moment it is aware that you free the spirit from the lamp , but you are not interested in the smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you ready to meet us at the military security building &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can hin@@ ge you - nothing can withdraw your voice after you have lost your way up to the office of the security service from the body .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an was there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I now also .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me hear , as you are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; any@@ ahu &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or you are only bra@@ ve enough to cry when we are not nearby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his h@@ uts filled me up against me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you mourn what I have to look to me in the eyes , and not on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I then did , nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building .
perhaps it was on my fol@@ ly , vanity : perhaps on the revolution .
I was so sure when I said , &quot; I haven &apos;t thought that you have already forgotten my voice since yesterday .
and I think I never stopped to see you in the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
it was the shortest conversation that could have such disast@@ rous consequences for me , and I do not regre@@ t any word from what I said .
&quot; it is like him in one and his father equal with it . &quot;
&quot; his father equal with it . &quot;
the st@@ ank of this curse is from me until today in the nose .
he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a se@@ el@@ ian torture being exposed to months .
I pier@@ ced the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with me .
then again through the farm and into the second office which leads through a ais@@ le to the individual cells .
I make sure all the details exactly before I serve the room .
otherwise , they gave me a bigger cell in this time .
I have to share them with only one another det@@ ain@@ ees and may immediately place me without waiting for their permission .
after some minutes that felt like a whole life , the civil servants left the cell , and I left to a old proven communication method : with the f@@ ist against the wall .
I knew that my Z@@ ellen@@ com@@ rade was a &quot; Er@@ s@@ th@@ at@@ ling . &quot;
after a long ignition , he finally responded to me .
apparently there was not one of the surrounding cells a well @-@ respected citizen , who looks like me and called &quot; The doctor &quot; in no way .
in the perfect darkness there is no striking fac@@ ial characteristics , and doctors are not available here ; we are all just numbers .
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice is like My sounds ? &quot;
all answers connected with its existence .
perhaps he was re@@ located to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will stop immediately .
the investig@@ ator had insured me , they would be happy when I stay .
Lü@@ g@@ ner .
I would like to have had a bird @-@ trap in order to distribute all of these c@@ rows , which lab@@ elled on the fruit in the garden of my head lab@@ s .
from afar , I still hear &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; and sh@@ out .
it must be at least 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the cri@@ es , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black is the color of the Ver@@ der@@ y , until I saw the yellow light , which presented us the grave in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Donn@@ er , &quot; playing on 13th S@@ ure of the Kor@@ an ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are here to hear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the secret was lab@@ eled : to protect the state security in front of us and to prevent the terrorist attacks in us , they speak in al@@ a@@ wit@@ ic dial@@ ect - thus they played their con@@ fin@@ ite replacement card and ri@@ ver@@ ed the narrow eye view of its world view .
here is no house , which is not a country ; it is a curse to call it Ko@@ exist to transform the crimin@@ als of her tone in a hero .
I cared for the hearing space and meet to Abu I@@ mad , a slim and sto@@ cky man ; at least he comes so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he starts a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conversation , despite the fac@@ ial expres@@ sions , which you are still young , you can start your life as much as you join this day@@ di@@ ly and to protest demonstrations , so why will soon be an end &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I acc@@ ust@@ omed to answer me , not to answer .
I can really no longer say when Bel@@ ei@@ vers and stro@@ kes have become a friendly conversation for me at a common communication tool .
when and how this happened , was un@@ important .
some voice said in me said that I had to get used for me or bad , though I had done nothing to earn this punishment .
an penalty in all its diversity .
its command is to rip so much flesh as possible from the body .
he calls the aff@@ ection@@ ately &quot; conf@@ ession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe that probably originates from the hooks .
your Hen@@ ker beat down to your cry .
give him the pleasure , you can not measure you with him , and you can &apos;t keep your cry .
my carp@@ enters did not get enough , why they were dispos@@ ed of the tube through a cable .
in my first arrest I asked if the investig@@ ator had been working earlier times as gar@@ bage collector , or whether it belonged to normal working equipment .
they had four cable attached to each other to present themselves from their sight , great invention of a huge cable .
three of them only changes three of them while I was still in the series .
I had lost all the feeling in my body - and my voice , so I stopped to cry out .
the Hen@@ ker re@@ perc@@ ei@@ ves the cooling , and found no pleasure in any case , which is why he found the next to an electrically charged rod .
electricity f@@ lowed all the body , enough to feed my whole quarter .
my semi @-@ naked body , which was stretched out on the ground , was the perfect current conductor .
the dew van@@ ished and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had met his duty to this night .
it must have been at midnight .
I decided to sleep me again ; let &apos;s say , that was my only option .
some hours passed , which came to me as minutes .
then the call for the morning prayer .
the door opens and the morning light meets the space &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am answering with the voice of a troubled youth : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my lord , my father must be fear@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet , and you shall be moved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always been released .
where do they lead me ? !
the j@@ ord@@ an R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b speaks about the rights of the L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + community , free expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
this picture was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b brings the most part of its time inside ; sometimes it ends on his canvas , time to his computer , and again to his couch .
what can be left , however , a cig@@ ar between his fingers or his nic@@ ot@@ ine lips can be discovered .
he lives in the top of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel had forced his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs family had forced to flee from their village in Palestine , where she lived as fel@@ ah@@ y@@ een ( about : farmer ) .
for now six years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is a passionate activ@@ ist , the conservative majority , and its old proven opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and free expression of expression by art and Rap@@ id .
with his music that sets out often with topics such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian poultry . all these themes do not only find in his home town Am@@ man Rel@@ ev@@ ance , but also in cities that range from Damascus until to San@@ aa in Yemen .
at the age of 25 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees itself as someone who has not restricted to his thinking by borders , and he can feel the most devastating of foreign inter@@ ventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria , and Libya .
even though he did not open it , he over@@ threw the US foreign policy against the US foreign policy .
he considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b doesn &apos;t believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones , anything with his identity as &quot; Palestinian poultry , &quot; as he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine until now .
&quot; I don &apos;t think of my own life , st@@ resses H@@ d@@ ai@@ b .
then he adds : &quot; I think so because I am a man &quot; while he dissolved in water in two cups . it is the holy month Ram@@ adan . in this time it is planned for Muslims , from sunrise to sunset .
in addition , the Jord@@ anian law states that the public consumption of food is illegal during Ram@@ adan .
obviously , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weak@@ nesses to break with ancient traditions , on the other hand , a cup of coffee in a sen@@ sible Jun@@ e@@ ag has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically the gap sh@@ immer@@ se coffee and the cr@@ amp@@ ons of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose in the first line of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the free sky , especially if you th@@ rows a look into the neighbouring countries .
therefore it avo@@ ids easy to do fundamental things - as to drink in the public during the Ram@@ adan water - to land not in prison .
recently , the Interior Ministry of Foreign Affairs has had a appearance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a , cancelled , already for the second time .
some parliamentary committee that support the Islamic State Court - argu@@ ed that the Bank &apos;s sexual orientation is argu@@ ed that the sexual orientation of hom@@ osexual fron@@ ers Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o , contra@@ dic@@ ated the cultural and traditional nor@@ ms of the country and contra@@ dic@@ ts the main reason for the concert table .
the de@@ pu@@ ties and former spokes@@ woman of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b spoke in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert had been cancelled due to sexual orientation of the singers .
many claim also , the commitment of the band in matters like the Arab Spring , human rights and free expression of expression in the Arab world may be more dangerous acti@@ vis@@ m that has the most proven legitim@@ acy of the regime in the entire region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a estimates the j@@ ord@@ an people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights &quot; who continue to continue &quot; for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement is probably not easy to use the rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic , but actually reflects a clear cryst@@ all@@ ine reality in Jordan , which clearly represents the appearance in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs &apos;s plant .
in 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b traditional gender s@@ nor@@ ms came to body by having formed his vision of the fate of Arabic women who have vo@@ re@@ hel@@ i@@ chen sex .
the picture shows the sk@@ el@@ eton of a apparently hor@@ red woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those who actually should trust .
in the past few years , the number of &quot; Hon@@ mor@@ ant &quot; has risen - the un@@ official outside in Jordan .
human Rights Watch according to Human Rights Watch it reached its cli@@ max in the year 2016 ; however , the institutional infrastructure is missing in order to support women who tried the victims of mur@@ ders or domestic violence .
according to a law to un@@ break@@ age from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence , &quot; on un@@ certain time in prison , &quot; and for their release is often a lon@@ ge@@ bureau@@ cr@@ atic effort as well as the guarantee on the family that the woman will not happen .
also H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs Music enjoys great popularity and is well @-@ known for that , not to rever@@ ence issues that can be seen in his country as tab@@ oo .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b gu@@ ards that his work is political , however , is that he could not separate his music , which is full of exp@@ ir@@ ations on sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression of expression , cannot be separated from politics .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; me was pur@@ ified , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says he . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; taking H@@ d@@ ai@@ b the question of the Palestinian identity in the attack .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of the songs which are polit@@ ically political , can be continued .
in March 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b published a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song , verse is often repe@@ ating :
&quot; you are free , and every other is it . &quot;
in the course of the songs , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a sort of market , on which one can get in his words , &quot; what you want &quot; - unless it is faith or non @-@ faith , hetero@@ gen@@ e@@ or homosexu@@ ality .
he not@@ ices that hardly anyone speaks in Jordan on the rights of gay and les@@ bi@@ ans , and that comments on equality of L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + individuals were gradually cen@@ sored in 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b led an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ anic On@@ line@@ program Ro@@ ya , to remember that his comments was torn out of context and were cen@@ sored in his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Youtube , it was up@@ loaded without cuts , but was only a revised version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says he . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today H@@ d@@ ai@@ b advert@@ ises the Arab L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + community community and represents the opinion that Int@@ ol@@ er@@ anz is dis@@ able compared to homosexu@@ als not to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ de , a po@@ ets of the eighth century , who still has remained in memory , thanks to its hom@@ o@@ erotic poems .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks : if Abu Nu@@ de , which was later to work on behalf of the Cali@@ ph , in the eighth century , more than homosexu@@ ality could say , why cannot Jord@@ anian people do it ?
the real problem , so hat@@ ch@@ ai@@ b , have nothing with m@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a or the fact that the concert was cancelled , to do .
in the h@@ ash@@ an kingdom there is nothing new , that the government disp@@ uted attacks on the free expression of opinion , and that progressive voices can be brought to silence .
recently , in January 2017 , the j@@ ord@@ anical news service took several former government representatives and members of the teacher &apos;s representative , with the reasons that critic@@ ises the problems in social media to be critic@@ ized with the deep in the country .
in view of what is the show of H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs , only the top of the ice @-@ ice - the real challenge is to act a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ anian .
for him , progress is a contin@@ ual En@@ ter and . Jordan , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a now has a gig in a row , but the way of progress - looks like H@@ d@@ ai@@ b - consists of slow , require and in@@ humane changes . he is sure that this changes from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
finally , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , like millions of other Arab@@ s , were from an Arab world without inter@@ ventions from abroad .
he dre@@ amed , not only to bring his work to Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to experience them . &quot;
perhaps the region will be ann@@ ul@@ ged with the help of music , art and literature of a real and fundamental re@@ vel@@ ih@@ ood - and not through bombs , spreading , and on artificial art . at least , he hopes it .
if it happen , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b becomes further ra@@ ging and therefore also resistance to resistance .
this report was made by the Pul@@ itzer Center on Crisis Reporting in which A@@ man belongs to the Fel@@ low as a student Fel@@ low .
Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan .
this great , ex@@ trav@@ ag@@ ant war@@ d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous the@@ ories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festivals .
it is believed that there is a variation of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory indicates that the land@@ lor@@ ds , the drums and the dance over over one thousand years have been delivered , in order to reach the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the Em@@ ishi , into the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to gra@@ b some great seats , so we have a great view .
one can imagine hard , how big these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition at W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally .
I have long been watching the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two fixed cars are straight ahead .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer Festival in the North of the Country .
I was there and I viewed the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the view of a 18 @-@ meter tower was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

rarely , outer appearance and body care is as important as in this history , because they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth from the crimin@@ ality and promote a legitim@@ ate profession as the Fr@@ ise@@ dec .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific ocean , near the historical centre of the capital Lima , a region with a very high crime rate , where street smo@@ b and illegal drugs are all day .
a survey , published in April 2017 , showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region should not feel safe .
at the same time Peru - as many other medium and South American countries - an rising demand of aesthetic services for men .
the trend , the appearance and thus also the f@@ ancy hair@@ style of famous athletes like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , has led to that more normal citizens joined the experienced hands of hair@@ dresser , which can compos@@ e these elabor@@ ate hair@@ dresser .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ dresser , which go to the ultimate bound@@ aries of imagination and creativity , has even made an annual event that competition the hair@@ style your &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os &quot; competition since 2014 .
there are experts from each other to show , who can create the ec@@ cent@@ ric l@@ ooks , as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current cont@@ ests is available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
education facilities such as school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to discuss their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools , and instead of bad Rat@@ ings a training in hair@@ dresser art , which makes it possible to find work .
motiv@@ ated by this activity and motiv@@ ating possibilities , dozens of young people saw that they can sei@@ ze a profession , which is currently in fashion .
the school started special training workshops before the school year in March and reported some of their achievements :
in 1995 we were the only technical school in the community and the district , where@@ of we are very proud , because of love to children we have built this educational community .
Colombia : love Letters to Gu@@ err@@ illa
photo : Valent@@ ina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with friendly permission .
the following article is the revised version of the contribution &quot; Liebes@@ kind to Guer@@ ill@@ ak@@ ov , &quot; which has published the International Online Magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write love letters to people who we know ?
is it not yet more important , people who can feel out@@ fit , aff@@ ection to and aff@@ ection ?
this question went to the two young Colom@@ bian activists from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ art and Crist@@ ian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young Youth Foundation . inspired them to send them to the campaign cart@@ as p@@ or la Re@@ conc@@ ili@@ aci@@ ón ( letters to reconciliation ) , the young people ex@@ hor@@ ted to write gu@@ err@@ illa letters .
only recently , their country was the scene of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to their part : after many long negotiations , the Colom@@ bian Government concluded a peace treaty with the gu@@ err@@ illa movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary forces Kol@@ umb@@ iens ) , which forms the point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
International was the signing of the peace agreement as so important that the Colom@@ bian president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for its mer@@ its .
however , in front of the column , however , it is still a long way until you can talk about a real reconciliation and peace .
Gu@@ err@@ illa , who lived for many years in illegal camps , were exposed to a war rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic and carried out around the clock their weapons in their lives again , in order to integrate them into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian company again , who had used to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hat@@ red opposite gu@@ err@@ illa had to take this one in their ranks , and they will support the construction of a new life .
Leonardo and Crist@@ ian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bian had to join themselves and help the integration process .
and this is exactly what they did : until now , thousands of young people wrote letters - love messages to former gu@@ err@@ illas to welcome them again in society .
the goal of the campaign will be 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former gu@@ err@@ ac@@ dam@@ pers - who is then to surrender personally .
the Valentine &apos;s Day for the Campa@@ ign
the idea for the reconciliation went to the world summit of the Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ate , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Crist@@ ian had the opportunity to talk shortly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ arth@@ i , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this declared that we love the people who love to write on Valentine &apos;s Day of love letters , but those who need to need to need much more necessary .
he was , telling his love in this year to share his love with people who needed the most ur@@ gent matters .
so the plan to write &quot; letters full of hope and support for former com@@ bat@@ ants of the F@@ ARC . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian company is ready to make the dis@@ course of a war history to a common history of peace . &quot; they say .
up to date , more than 2000 letters were collected within the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&quot; I never thought that someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to the Cal@@ don@@ o Cau@@ ca region on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o area .
a group of 40 students from the University J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city council of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ kind re@@ ists into the camp to express the letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC was so on how they had previously done earlier to meet the commands of their govern@@ ance .
but this time they did not receive any orders , but letters full of people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for all parties . &quot; it is incredible how many different feelings one can walk in just a few hours - from fear to luck and everything that lies between , &quot; related the political science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ nez Av@@ ila later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the governor of the Province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
after having passed the letters , a former fighter led me through the camp of gu@@ err@@ illa fighters .
when I in one of the &quot; Cam@@ book &quot; ( a kind of hut , in which the gu@@ err@@ illa Live ) saw , I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa who wrote something .
I was afraid to enter , because apart from him on the bed a M@@ GL @-@ pom@@ egran@@ ate , a dead@@ ly weapon in the village of a grave .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am answering a letter that someone has written to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful roll .
never in my life , someone else has written me something like this , and answer me . &quot; they ran into tears over the che@@ eks .
I em@@ bra@@ ced him , and put me in addition to the pom@@ egran@@ ate .
perhaps he was sorry for the war , I was sorry for all the years of faithful companions to be this killing , and would help him to write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never had something else from life as war . the F@@ ARC was the only possibility to preserve him and his six brothers in front of the Hung@@ er@@ to@@ d . &quot; I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mist@@ akes .
but now I know that there is a society outside , waiting for us with open arms .
now I have learned only how I have to handle weapons with weapons .
but now where peace rules , I can learn many things and work in dig@@ nity . &quot;
new voices
at the beginning , students and leaders of the F@@ ARC came to a discussion round .
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC was already in secret .
therefore , the leader of the F@@ ARC bands the history of the organization , their ide@@ als and gave insight into their views over the peace process : &quot; for many years , we have experienced the social un@@ righteousness on the entire Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can contribute to the society in this land .
for one goal of these magnitude , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them .
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
these people had never been hearing , who had never found any hearing , and to recognize that people who have seen often as monster and even hated even people with beautiful feelings , which were turned over by their li@@ mb@@ s and their environment was very painful for me .
the reality , in which the country lives , does hurt me .
but it comfort me that all men - even those who have killed , and so much damage caused us to bring us something that can give us a smile , and a smile , and a h@@ ug .
many former com@@ bat@@ ants have answered on the letters .
Gust@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote an example of Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ vo , Archbishop of the City of Cal@@ i , the following letter :
the column was prophesied that after the drainage peace would have rule in peace .
but this is not the case .
as long as ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to take up to the weapons of weapons and just@@ i@@ fies for their rights . and that is totally justified ( ... ) .
we use the F@@ ARC now to make peace on a policy without weapons .
for this reason , we call all defense of peace - no matter what race , religion or ide@@ ology they belong to themselves - over all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , aff@@ ord our contribution and sacrifice , because we know from my own experience that nothing is easy . those among us who defend life as the basis of existence , many difficulties will be im@@ pending .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but we will overcome them .
a Trans@@ figuration talks about the persec@@ utions in Ch@@ echn@@ ya and life before Kad@@ y@@ row

this follows the translation of an article that was written by our partner A@@ ida Mir@@ mac@@ ar@@ owa , and its first published in the website of OC Media .
hom@@ osexual and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a large range of d@@ angers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and ex@@ pressing .
with fear , activists have witnessed over the recent months over the persecution of the persecution of males in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat , which depends on an Dam@@ o@@ cl@@ eric value above the local L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q community , it wasn &apos;t possible only about night .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what happens in the republic .
the L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya took the international head@@ lines in several months after reports were published , which were recorded the dis@@ si@@ p@@ ation , torture and killing que@@ ens in the Republic .
the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aja Gas@@ eta ; they threw a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities who took a susp@@ ect que@@ fied men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; they brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a wife , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there .
in her childhood she felt that she was a woman in reality .
when she was educ@@ ated , you became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a saf@@ er place for her , why she moved to Moscow .
after having experienced a group of bats from the gender equality of her land , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina .
in fear of her life , she moved the last En@@ ter in the USA .
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunte@@ er hel@@ per in a human rights organisation .
one day was told me that someone needed my help .
it was a friend of Da@@ gest@@ an , a Trans@@ figuration , who put in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , he had a friend of whom I thought , he would be a friend of my documents and spread them anywhere in the internet , with my telephone number and a picture of me . &quot; then , there are no men more in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can remove this confusion ? &quot;
after that the photos taken by my documents through all W@@ hat@@ s@@ app the round .
on 10 October 2015 , I was attacked .
when I was doing so , a couple of grocery store away from the back seat of my car , I heard a mas@@ quer@@ im@@ me : &quot; here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
when I turned back , I felt anything in my body , but I did nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time on t@@ ang@@ y : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will you honor the family ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I only know that there was a young man , no 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and aw@@ aked at the final conclusion of the hospital .
apparently some women had carried out all together and starting to cry .
the man was fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I learned that I had taken two people in my right pul@@ mon@@ ary .
OC Media : in which gu@@ ards have been laid - in the men or women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are ob@@ sol@@ ete , there is still my male name , but the doctor stood and laid me on women .
I am very grat@@ eful to him .
when I read his name for the first time in his brush , I got to do with fear ; it was a Muslim name , a Cau@@ cas@@ ian name .
but he turned out as a good man .
I am grat@@ eful to him that he has respec@@ t@@ ful with me .
I spent more than one month in hospital .
I got a thre@@ ats last February .
they called me , they wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbours and some away relatives .
the requested me to send me to Ch@@ echn@@ ya , to prove that everything was a lie .
they asked ab@@ sur@@ d claims : some told me that I had to prove it without through the streets ; others , that I didn &apos;t change my sex at the official TV in Gro@@ z@@ ny , saying that I was not bad my sex , and Photoshop .
I have grain size C - what would I have to say in television ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it is still difficult for them .
some older people said once my mother on the street .
they said to her , &quot; They have brought a monster to the world , but not only your family , but the entire republic is disappointed .
we can not touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot;
my mother became too much and she lay a kn@@ ck around the neck .
fortunately , the neighbours and they saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and already a few hours later , under the window a car with dar@@ kened windows and a number plate with a 95 rate .
after the third time it happened , it was clear that something is la@@ zy .
my human rights of human rights tested the number@@ ing signs - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how are you fled ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for safety reasons I don &apos;t want to give her name , but I will say that I remember them all , they really helped me .
with her help I left the country , but then something un@@ cre@@ dible .
I can still realize how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived .
I bought it without registration , without getting off , without everything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the tr@@ ash .
came and checked in the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
in the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ app , I got a message : &quot; you believe not what you have left the country ?
our people know , in which hotel you plug . you even know your room number .
just to prove it : it is number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine that ? !
this was my room number .
OC Media : do you still stand in touch with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we don &apos;t speak about gender equality , but this is a tobacco topic .
I still bear some traditional Cau@@ cas@@ ian elements in me .
so I wish I wish to overcome this se@@ el@@ ic barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to viol@@ ate them .
when we ch@@ ill with the camera , I give to me trying to see how the person wants to see them out of their past - so remin@@ is@@ cent of my male form .
but this is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current position in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what are your friends , those who have stayed ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
for this I needed more information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I spoke with som@@ eb@@ ody who saved one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he told that during Ram@@ adan no people were arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the Ram@@ adan had hardly waiting to wait , and he didn &apos;t lock a new wave .
most likely they are now focusing on family and relatives .
so , I , they probably invite their relatives to worry about the problem with the person concerned and at the end , proof of evidence that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced by blood .
OC Media : are now even pregnant women in these secrets ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of Me , it &apos;s not very many .
if , then , above all those who have no temporary relatives or have dropped from their relatives to ask the Kad@@ y@@ row court .
as far as I know , they are imprisoned there , so that they can present them later than terror@@ ists .
say : should they be destroyed , they will show their bodies in television and claim to attack any village or a military base .
do you understand ?
however , these men were not simply disappeared , but targeted to radi@@ alize them .
OC Media : is this now only a mut@@ ation or have you a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just sh@@ ear someone who was imprisoned in Ar@@ gun in a half months .
he says that many people had disappeared in this prison after having grown .
there have been nothing new from them .
they simply took them away .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was taken away when these people were taken away .
until now they were not presented as band@@ its , but there was no reports so far . we accept that such actions are possible .
why else would you not allowed this man to shave ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ apping of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation already in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I registered my hair for ever .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had one Bob .
I think , already before 2003 I was already known in Gro@@ z@@ ny , when I lived there - and I never had problems .
in Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sh@@ aria applied , I never had problems .
on the contrary , there was a lot more secure than now .
in Russia , Russia wanted to bring us to the civil war , but ultimately cast us back into the Stone Age .
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were exhau@@ sted ; I had colored eyelashes , with tube je@@ ans and short tops .
the safety Ministry of Sh@@ aria has never too hat@@ tered to me only one hair .
before the Russian Theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people like me arrived .
it was a small place where several banks were standing , and the whole city knew it . they knew why men , young people met there .
we have never been off@@ ended .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a h@@ iring : l@@ ad l@@ ad Khar@@ da . that is , &quot; Sp@@ o@@ ons not talk about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
it is often said to children when they are funny about sick people .
OC Media : so you simply shut up their eyes before you because they believed you are ill ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never off@@ ended me , never ch@@ ased and never struck .
OC Media : how long has this grace time seen ?
Sab@@ rina : as long as Kad@@ y@@ row joined the plan .
when he was appointed prime minister in 2005 , he began to talk about Mor@@ al in television .
he spoke not over us , but advanced over the behaviour of women .
nevertheless - I could feel the people in the city began to change .
he who was first arrested and was wonder@@ ing at once with suspic@@ ion .
in the time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but each time I came back home , I was able to feel the situation in the republic steadily .
OC Media : what activity do you go now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I do not earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month in the USA .
apart from that , I was still active as a activists .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communic@@ ating with them as a sort of psych@@ ologist .
we perfectly organize Te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , gathering together , I kept them to the hospital and help them to get food types .
I did not attain a cent .
I discovered these people even when I cut off @-@ sto@@ cked sor@@ row@@ ed .
I am Mus@@ lim@@ a and want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s al@@ lied .
so the nature , that has nothing to do with religion .
that &apos;s exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens who wants to prophesy with foam before your mouth , there is no oscill@@ ating with them .
those who have the Cab@@ ard@@ iner who also have Russians also who have Russians also ; on the whole planet it is - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , that &apos;s why it is un@@ pleasant to hear what to hear .
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practic@@ ing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast@@ en during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
know , many think of tran@@ sid@@ ent@@ ity of men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but this is a tru@@ er .
these are two different things - two different types of sensation to be exact , different living settings .
for me , it is the most important , to feel me in my own skin , and not ashamed of my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
sorry I &apos;m so personally personally , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I just know that I &apos;m now myself .
local groups war@@ ns in front of an increase of self @-@ moral those within the de@@ hum@@ ed Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suff@@ ers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty within the local Arab population .
since the last months there has been a strong increase of self @-@ mor@@ sel .

the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i , on August 27 , moved the situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran , which is dominated by poverty and unemployment .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered under anxi@@ ety , depression , and he sh@@ amed for his own hel@@ pl@@ ess to escape the in@@ ability for his family , so Ah@@ ra@@ az@@ i Human Rights groups who are working in Ah@@ wa@@ z and anonymous .
on YouTube video , the moments spent the moments after he had ign@@ ited itself .
some people managed it quickly to delete the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the valley station in the town of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , bur@@ ns was so strong that doctors could do nothing more .
he died short time later .
it was not the only suicide in August which has happened in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i minority , and activists in front of the spot that even more men may take life .
Ah@@ mad@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights told that this month some other - Ham@@ id Manifest@@ o , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sh@@ ah@@ ab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - hanged .
their stories have a thing in common : there were all family do@@ ers who decided to feed their families because of persecution on the Iranian government , hel@@ pl@@ ess and indisp@@ ens@@ able to feed their families and to ensure safe work .
Arab Ah@@ mad@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment , and discrimination
the region , which is located in the most part of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community , was sh@@ aken by a pro@@ found economic crisis which makes it difficult to contest its native Arab population to contest their li@@ vel@@ ih@@ ood .
one century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z had an predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ahl@@ avi Mon@@ archy took power in 1925 to end great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z Region , there are some of the largest in Iran &apos;s coming oil and gas fields as well as some of the most common and valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continue to continue slowly , and the indigenous population receives only little of this wealth .
it is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and emp@@ t@@ ances .
the Iranian regime ref@@ uses the Ah@@ mad@@ az@@ i @-@ Arab@@ s systematically jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government also built a multitude of dam@@ s , the waters of Arab regions in the Persian areas , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and Gh@@ om are moved .
this dam@@ s have only led to destroy them in the region by dr@@ y@@ ness , devast@@ ation and local agriculture as well as the fish and pal@@ ms industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ ha@@ w@@ zi @-@ adolescents now rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian Director for co@@ operating , work , and social welfare , told that 5 % of the ancestors of Ah@@ mad@@ az@@ is , who finished elementary school , completed 55 % a secondary school , and 45 % have a university degree .
a &quot; systematic strategy ... that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot;
Kar@@ im Doh@@ im@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Human Rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , said Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist origin , &quot; a high increase in the number of self @-@ moral among the young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ men .
Doh@@ im@@ i said that particularly the unemployment has got worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ sians and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the setting process :
since Fun@@ ctional and institutions pre@@ fers to set up Arab labour force , the local Arab A@@ w@@ az@@ i will de@@ pri@@ ved access to work opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aimed at destro@@ ying the spirit of national resistance of young Arab@@ ians and to force them , to earn their li@@ vel@@ ih@@ ood outside their home ancest@@ or .
there are people who had to hide their benefits and sur@@ names to hide their affili@@ ation to Ah@@ mad@@ az@@ i and thus an@@ odi@@ zed , since the Arab name cannot be toler@@ ated in the workplace , because the speaking of Arabic language or carrying out of Arabic clothing .
given the given circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i have to carry out human rights activists before the situation will become explosive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it remains to wait if the world aw@@ akes and assumes it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; why didn &apos;t I identi@@ fi@@ able with the femin@@ ism , also with the inter@@ sec@@ tional@@ ism

the following article is a revised version of the opinion that was published by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website . the article was subject to several discussions where many different positions arrived .
you can read in the commentary under the original text .
if I say that I &apos;m not a femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women who describe themselves as an inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with Fr@@ ust .
they are wonder@@ ing why I &apos;m not part of the movement .
they even have well thought scientific and social arguments from me why I should be femin@@ ized and why we should generally all femin@@ ists .
for example , that women still earn less money despite the same formation as men .
that women are still under str@@ ingent observation , if it is doing what they are allowed to do with her body .
that violence is a global epidemic .
or that cultural and social standards are still to ensure that women or later stum@@ bles in various areas of life to a glass blan@@ ket , and that discrimination based on sex is still passing through the many different countries and faith .
all this is aware and known .
I &apos;m convinced of this and I suffer double and triple .
I am a black woman .
and yet , if I have to speak on skin colour , on rac@@ ism , on black c@@ is women , on black women in the L@@ GB@@ TI@@ Q municipality , or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention that kind of physical and verb@@ al mis@@ ses , many white femin@@ ists , and white inter@@ sec@@ ular femin@@ ists .
however , they all agree that women - all women - together should be able to sing &quot; their voices , and &apos; K@@ umb@@ aya , my lord &apos; to sing , to get the Gender Equality ( some ) of the women .
but they don &apos;t want to talk about that it is in addition to sexu@@ alised violence and assist@@ ants motiv@@ ated violence that we are exposed to black women on two times .
or about that black women and women of other eth@@ nic@@ ities as white men and women earn less than white men and women .
black girls and girls with migration background of the school are understood as white girls due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black spin@@ ach and women with migration background are exposed to a higher risk of domestic violence and violence in partnership , as white women .
on the other hand , I want to have all the women , all the men and all human rights . on the other hand , I can not join me as black woman , whose center is the white woman who refused to consider un@@ just un@@ belief in their thinking , which relate to both the sex as well as to the skin colour of a person .
I am exhau@@ sted and will no longer fight my affili@@ ation in a white fem@@ inist orient@@ ated sphere that loves me and countless other black women always .
in her words , So@@ y@@ ner compl@@ ained in 1851 in her words , &quot; Am I not a woman ? &quot; and I myself also refused to just@@ ify a ide@@ ology in which the black woman is a human and mar@@ g@@ inal beings .
I sof@@ tened me to join the group@@ ings , which also absorb our customs and customs to drive their eg@@ o@@ cent@@ ric program .
I will no longer try to draw white women the importance of the over@@ l@@ apping of skin colour and gender . for some of them will continue to keep the importance of black women for fem@@ inist movement dead , no matter how many black women try to honor them one better .
although the inter@@ sec@@ ular femin@@ ism was founded to give women different Her@@ bs a home and became a talk of white femin@@ ism , is still the word &quot; Femin@@ ism &quot; in his name .
I preferred it to resol@@ ve me and join the movement of the W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , who was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of myself for a white fem@@ inist par@@ a@@ dig@@ m that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tional@@ ity is being celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever before we define black women to our own performances and give us into the sphere that we will be created for us .
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ c@@ ana wom@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves to create our own kind . and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they can be completely safe in which the cultural , spiritual , se@@ el@@ ian , physical and even the spiritual elements can make the black women .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists will be spoken immediately , after they have read these lines , please inqu@@ ire about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contra@@ di@@ ctions of fem@@ inist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures , because I have existed in this par@@ a@@ dig@@ m .
I am recognized because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman as part of this par@@ a@@ dig@@ m .
I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in a environment in which my life has not passed , nor igno@@ red , yet will be denied .

Paraguay Women and their difficult fight against violence
a group of women is &quot; The crying women &quot; to present their pain on the women &apos;s mor@@ sel in the country and in the region and to show their re@@ jection .

the following article is the shortened and worked version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; from Kur@@ ds . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # we@@ ili@@ ch@@ ein@@ e@@ fr@@ aud ) , which report on the wave of violence against women in Paraguay .
most names were changed to protect the people affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a police Commissioner said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , that they had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , their own partner who had become violent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the end of her relationship a little time has passed and the police said , their statement would be laid to the acts , but more could not be done .
as a further woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed nothing mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment , including the acute dis@@ appointment of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez .
a few days later the second woman moved back to her ad .
to break the Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ ill@@ is of violence against women , is difficult .
if women make a display at all , they receive no support on the State .
in many cases , women are also fin@@ anci@@ ally dependent on men who ad@@ mis@@ ses them . this explains why only 20 % of all women who ad@@ mit to be victims of violence at all at all at all in the prosecution &apos;s criminal prosecution .
In@@ dex@@ 1 stro@@ kes and Statist@@ ical In@@ visible Mis@@ acts and an legal system that does not under@@ take 3 Paraguay laws : good approach , defic@@ i@@ ent implementation and statistics
it is difficult to determine how many women really har@@ assed , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , researcher at Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aci@@ ón y E@@ Studio , a social scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are different data and reports that , but not even an@@ sat@@ in to show the magnitude of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; declares them .
however , the figures available are al@@ ar@@ ming .
in 2015 the At@@ tor@@ ney General At@@ tor@@ ney reached 9@@ 600 AD due to domestic violence . 70 % of them went to violence against women .
86 % of ads come from women .
there were more than 5000 ads due to domestic violence because of domestic violence . 86 % of the ads arrived here .
in the ads 40 % of women who were physically disabled , 55 % of women spoke of psych@@ ic mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment .
however , this statistics show not the real propor@@ tions of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Women &apos;s Minister , Ana Bai@@ ard@@ i will actually be displayed only few of these criminal off@@ ences . &quot; on each woman who are re@@ im@@ bur@@ sed in Paraguay for mental mist@@ re@@ ation , there are 9 women who do not do this .
on any woman who will be re@@ im@@ bur@@ sed for physical abuse , two women who do not do it , &quot; declared at the end of 2014 .
since women in Paraguay no own off@@ ences , the prosec@@ ut@@ en@@ forcement agencies cannot represent adequate , such as many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners .
by August 2016 , journalists killed at least 12 cases of women in the country .
the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , in Paraguay all ten days a woman died due to violence through men .

invisible abuse and a legal system that does not decreases
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z was the fixed gir@@ l@@ friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the name of all her former friends .
at the beginning she did not want to do it , but then , after . this should always regre@@ t it for ever .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no more with Carlos together . for two years she bore the psych@@ ic violence against women and at the same time recogni@@ z@@ able the most common forms of violence :
I have never thought that I would be victims of mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment once .
if I have read it earlier , I thought that only women happens to be ro@@ uted , because they leave out of violent men .
I was convinced that I would never happen to happen .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment by Carlos Vera .
without name , they wrote on Facebook in which they described his popularity and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship , and told how he had ins@@ ulated them .
many people answered her contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked to rh@@ et@@ or@@ ish , whether he ever made the hand against them and refused to agree that his behavior was also a form of mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana , why they had fallen so long ago by Carlos and left him not earlier .
it seemed almost like that they wanted to say that victims of mist@@ re@@ acts would have at least a certain school@@ ing .
Victoria Santos , which is not from Paraguay , fought for eight years with the authorities in Paraguay , to prove that her former partner she mist@@ re@@ treated .
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o @-@ CRE@@ O network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) , which consists of women , who are all involved in any manner of abuse .
in the group , they can speak with others about their experience , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as , everything began with psychological abuse .
your well @-@ prosper@@ ous partners managed to convince them to convince her that she was valuable .
then he began to beat them .
Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as ads in the authorities remained without result and also from their relatives , they received no support .
she led a trial against her former partner , which developed into an un@@ ce@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and its home country , mainly for money , power and influence of former partner .
Paraguay laws : good approach , poor implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay many laws that are very good but not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the act of abuse is a way full of resist@@ ors and a fight against corruption in the j@@ udi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; says Victoria Santos .
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also looks great problems in the application of the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 a bill was discussed under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ el@@ la ( # Für@@ sten@@ ) under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ el@@ yn .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os Movement ( # Non@@ disposable Wen@@ iger ) are part of a campaign on Twitter published by Am@@ nesty International .
the original design of the law looks before , Fem@@ izi@@ d insi@@ sts to explain and har@@ der the har@@ der as already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
so the legisl@@ ature was modified in some points , to win the de@@ pu@@ ties for the law , that the way for the de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions are ge@@ ared , which are generally banned in Paraguay and will be punished by up to five years in prison .
the original bill had intended to charge the majority of the ( bureau@@ cr@@ atic and economic ) of proce@@ eding which have to wear the victims of violence even if they simply want to report it and secure a secure accommodation in the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri argu@@ ed that the law is not effective if the legisl@@ ature does not provide sufficient financial resources for this :
in Paraguay , mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment is seen as part of inter@@ human relationships .
here , a change must take place , so that violence is not considered to be more than a little bit .
those who keep silence in the presence of these facts makes himself guilty and contributes to the cul@@ mination of the perpet@@ rator .
we need to allow for a long display until this does not apply more than normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ an Senate . previously , parts of the law had been changed , among other things , among other things , among other things , a passage of domestic violence was transferred to reconciliation .
the opinions about the changes go apart .
the section on the reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the ag@@ gres@@ sor , to attack his offering .
the cancellation of the words &quot; sex , &quot; a political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; consists of parts of the law , however , is considered serious set@@ back .

independent media in Oman remains a year after the ban on a newspaper remains exposed to attacks

You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , remains in prison where he is a prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Ab@@ ri , were also arrested and placed prior to judgment , but later returned to judgment .

the last closing of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only one in Oman at the youngest time the Press Freedom was injured .
for further injuries , for example , the closing of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country , to put its operation .
due to the continuous closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of the Al @-@ Ha@@ j journalist , the Russian authorities are still not ready to prepare an end to the extensive violation of the Press Freedom .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the Hungarian authorities on :
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately release and un@@ conditional ;
2. to create a secure environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n to bring their journalists to their work ;
3 . protect the Press Freedom in the Country , and
4 . in any circumstances ensure that human rights and journalists in Oman have caused its right @-@ right human rights work without hin@@ dered and without fear of criminal measures , including judicial ch@@ ic@@ ans .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understanding
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ er 2016 in Zambia , figure takes place with his consent .
medical research in Africa is only rarely mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most ur@@ gent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the demand at the site of the medical research there are two reasons : a lack of health benefits and vacc@@ ines that cover the special medical needs on the African continent .
ill@@ nesses such as AIDS , tuber@@ culosis and malaria have reached widespread effects in the p@@ oo@@ rest countries in Africa , elsewhere , and lack of investments in research of these diseases by pharmac@@ euticals are a big problem .
secon@@ dly , research , which is carried out by African scientists themselves is to develop its own research capacities in Africa . a major role of science and technology can only be eligible for the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ er is director of the Centre for the research of inf@@ ectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epidemic , showed the first gra@@ ft impact on the national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Louis@@ iana , later in Indiana .
as a post@@ doctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania , he resear@@ ching the HIV virus at the University of Pennsylvania before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ ic health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. Warri@@ er discussed about the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understanding of media over these research .
( Dis@@ claim@@ er : Dr. Warri@@ er talks as a private teacher ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ er RW : at the moment the focus of my work on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ ic national programme for anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I got a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ o@@ gens .
g@@ v : what are your opinion about the important current scientific topics in your country and in Africa ?
how do they distinguish themselves from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only have solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this must change , otherwise we will always stay receivers rather than to be M@@ acher myself .
solutions that we get , are often not suitable in our environment , and sometimes it is impossible to use them here .
g@@ v : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult it is to find appropriate scientist for the projects ?
RW : from USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently .
it is difficult to find people who come back or come here , because the financing and development chances are better in other countries .
g@@ v : how is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not correspond to the standards in developed countries . it costs plenty of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import from other countries .
g@@ v : how is the opinion of the public about Science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are already interest but only a very limited understanding scientific methods .
I would propose that critical thinking and scientific methods to be taught in schools to improve the situation .
g@@ v : how large is your opinion , according to the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on , and how can we support development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all age groups .
there are demand for special scientific training , beginning at each age .
social sciences , Computer Science , Big Data , Expl@@ oration of World Health , health ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and ag@@ ious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine are highly benefit .
g@@ v : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as scientists in Africa across Western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : often you are limited to do things , things to do and the access to scientific expertise that represent challenges here .
the system that magazines make only accessible against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , limited to the amount of available information and the speed of research .
from USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change worldwide food production
this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the En@@ si@@ a.com website , a magazine published about solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank M@@ orton has been active in the USA for late 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties , such as out@@ shred@@ der , the first plant , cultivated by NASA ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts in space and has been consumed .
for almost 20 years , Mort@@ al &apos;s work was placed only by its own in@@ gest@@ ion and the question as many sal@@ at@@ kinds of sal@@ aries can be set .
but at the beginning of the 2000 , he noticed that more Sal@@ ads were patented and that he could not use them for breeding .
the patents are not only for single s@@ orts , but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green@@ ish or che@@ es@@ ful leaves .
over the past few years , more such patents have been registered for more plants such as cer@@ eal or fleet types . due to this trends , plant bre@@ eders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and expert for food safety ensure the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia old , M@@ orton requires more let@@ tu@@ ce , but he doesn &apos;t need more , because his work is always worth more limitations .
&quot; it is , when I lie down in a river , a b@@ oul@@ ders should lie down .
so we have to make it right now , but it &apos;s a break with breeding tradition , &quot; says he . &quot; I think that these patents will go into sal@@ ads .
and if they stand before the court , no one cannot represent a new sal@@ ads , because all features are patented . &quot; he makes so good as possible and tries to recover the features that he would like .
however , he is very careful and ende@@ av@@ oured to use no material that is protected as intellectual property .
it also has a movement connected to the USA and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; ) .
ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have been bred red Rö@@ mer@@ sal@@ at the variety of shred@@ der in the &quot; green@@ house &quot; of the station and it is tested if plants can be cultivated in space .

it is no co@@ incidence that this name sounds rather as it would be the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding .
the open source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seed ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software , the alternatives to copyright protected software .
it was launched in order to ensure that some plant species and gene are not protected as intellectual property , and can be used for plant bre@@ eders permanent .
as part of the initiative , for about Oss@@ i , US bre@@ eders could under@@ take that other seeds may use them for them .
this does not mean that they do not continue doing business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ eders allow merely others to cross their seed , and not immediately send out - two aspects which are prohibited by many plants or prescribed by many plants .
dozens of bre@@ eders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
sc@@ aff@@ ection@@ ery prospects
for the emer@@ itus professor at the University of Wisconsin @-@ Madison and Oss@@ i @-@ board Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control of seed and the possibility to breeding new plants and for environmental protection as well as for environmental protection .
seed is according to him , according to biodiversity , rights of pe@@ as@@ ants , control over the nutrition system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would try to use the latter not or just a little bit by using them seed with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphas@@ ises that the &quot; open source &quot; movement does not work with genet@@ ically altered plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , cor@@ n , genet@@ ically modified or not , from organic agriculture or not . &quot; those who like good , locally and su@@ re@@ produc@@ ible vegetables , like it is offered on pe@@ asant markets , should also know how it is far@@ med in pe@@ asant markets , as such as this vegetables is bred , is threatened .
nutritional so@@ vereig@@ n@@ ty without seed so@@ vereign is not possible . &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative under@@ take to provide other their seed in order to provide plant , seed and vegetable features .
photo of Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
Oss@@ i supporters argu@@ ing that the food industry is at risk to end@@ anger@@ ed since the available gene pool due to the always great spiritual property rights on plant material , which is thus always limited , un@@ paved .
Claire Lu@@ by , Executive Director of Oss@@ i , has worked in its thesis with a genetic variation in car@@ rot and their availability . it found out that approximately one @-@ third of all card features are protected as intellectual property , which makes it impossible for plant bre@@ eders either at all or less .
for other plants there are such estimates not yet , but experts such as Lu@@ by prevented that mass graves are patented such as wheat into even greater style , as a salad or car@@ rot .
a Question of Vis@@ iting
plants are grown so far@@ med that they have targeted well @-@ wanted characteristics - from such that their taste or their color has improved to such , due to them in certain environments such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant characteristics prove that the available plant material for bre@@ eders through more patents . genetic diversity is currently more need@@ less than ever before , because the changing conditions caused by climate change much worse .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ spokes@@ person Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to indicate that genetic diversity is generally important and also decisive for mon@@ san@@ tos activities . with a total of four Gen@@ banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Agriculture Ministry of the United States , the company has set itself the company for the preservation of genetic diversity .
however , it contra@@ dic@@ ure the view that intellectual property is promoting other bre@@ eders , as &quot; patents and the protection of plant vari@@ ances . &quot; a patent is basically taken into a plan if the patent expi@@ res as soon as the patent expi@@ res .
often these statements help others to come with another method for the same result .
such protection is not in@@ hib@@ ited to innovations , but promotes that the public will provide more material and know @-@ how to be provided . &quot;
M@@ orton looks at least 20 years to wait until a patent expi@@ res , and certainly no innovations .
and if you have to wait for long time to keep plants , which have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions , one would have lost the fight .
the main argument for M@@ orton requires that genetic resources always have been a general good and continue to remain : &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ et@@ aires are not attractive for us .
we want to make farmers their work .
that &apos;s what we use , and it is impossible to use us if we cannot use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot;
in total , M@@ orton does not distur@@ b the concept to be patented . &quot; we are creating the features really itself .
the plants form them even as bre@@ eder , we finally have no idea how plants do this .
a mystery of nature . &quot;
for Carol Dep@@ pe , Plant @-@ Se@@ eds in the U.S. state of Oregon and Oss@@ i @-@ board , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; those who are in@@ hib@@ ited a variety even though its own values are in them .
those who believes in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , which are needed to cultiv@@ ate the cultivation of her@@ bic@@ ide , breeding in his varieties of this concept of agriculture .
my concept is accurate . &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized enterprises ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , they are able to survive most smaller seed companies - either re@@ ject the pat@@ enting or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case .
the independent plant bre@@ eders Frank M@@ orton requires sal@@ ads in its breeding garden Sal@@ ads .
photo of Karen M@@ orton .
M@@ orton is also the view that bre@@ eders could become innovative by the Av@@ oid of plant patents : &quot; it looks like that , when I was with my efforts to produce new things , more strongly than companies that patented .
I need a constantly new material for my catalog , since I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years , &quot; says he . &quot; with a patent you are protected for 20 years before competition , where you can easily make it very nice . &quot;
although the United States seem to be a leader in the &quot; Open Source &quot; instruction , the concept has now spread rapidly across all over the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) describes itself as professional organization in the field of resources , a &quot; open source &quot; seed program . for the preservation of traditional plant varieties , the centre works with farmers and helps them to breeding new varieties that meet certain requirements .
it also supports , to come to &quot; open source &quot; seed seeds and sell their own .
the German organization Agre@@ ed to an &quot; open @-@ source &quot; licence , which ultimately must be a formal and legally binding form of Oss@@ i @-@ commitment for bre@@ eders in the European Union .
( regulations for breeding are different from country to country , in addition to Oss@@ i &apos;s commitment can not simply be taken one in one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission declared that conven@@ tionally grown plants should not be patented . thus , they are against the current practice of the European Patent , which allowed patents to conven@@ tionally cultivated plants .
however , a declaration is not yet a law ; now it is in the governments of the Member States to bring this new line to the governments of the Patent Office .
in October 2016 the Dutch organization H@@ iv@@ os organized a conference to &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , to farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , non @-@ governmental organizations and seed companies from all over East Africa to find something about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the global trend towards achieving seed seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for the &quot; Open Source &quot; program for H@@ iv@@ os &apos; Programme for &quot; Open Source &quot; -@@ seed systems currently declared that the organization is supposed to be a worldwide alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems which will be scheduled to fall again next year .
a merger from environmental protection and development groups ( including H@@ iv@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development organization US@@ C Canada and the action group to ero@@ sion , technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database to seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed @-@ good map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global Alliance for the future of Essen@@ tial - a union with aid organisations like the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , published a report that farmers have to be able to share them and improve the seed policy to ensure a stable supply of food safety .
in the report , the importance of a varied , local supply with seed for sustainable food systems is emphas@@ ised - a connection between the Lu@@ by of Oss@@ i hopes that soon more people will recognize him .
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has almost identical to where and how little is grown , and seed systems have hardly been played , &quot; so Lu@@ by . &quot; we try to clear the human being , that even more behind their food . &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the newest goals of the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still lock content on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ ni@@ est .
on the weekend of the 5th August the Egyptian government closed the website of the Holy Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ H@@ RI ) , which documents the human rights ab@@ uses in Egypt and the Arab world and reports about that .
in August , the network published a statement on Facebook , where the Egyptian authorities critic@@ ized for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the Holy Network for Human Rights Information abi@@ ding in spite of this attack and the constitution of Egyptian Law and the Constitution . even if it was never so difficult to follow these goals , it was not so important as now . AN@@ H@@ RI confirms that all technical possibilities shall be exhau@@ sted to overcome the blocking and not after . we hope to meet our task .
AN@@ H@@ RI is regarded as the first zen@@ ed website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities block the independent news page MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , arab@@ ic @-@ speaking Edition of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and Qatar in Qatar for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of wave of wave lines like victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main sources of human rights in Arabic language ht@@ t@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / N@@ IZ@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
apart from AN@@ H@@ RI , there is no access to the blog of the colum@@ ni@@ est and Human Rights researcher Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada no access in Egypt .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the dis@@ sem@@ ination of column and articles that he is not accessible for living in Egypt .
now the blog he set up in order to circum@@ vent the Egyptian government , even the goal of an attack .
blo@@ gger who is native to the also Zi@@ i@@ ada blog is on the other hand , however , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity , after he reported in December 2013 by Egyptian security forces , while he took a video on the student leaders , as the police took physical violence against two students .
its articles are mainly based on politics and human rights situation in Egypt .
in a fac@@ ebook comment , Zi@@ ada expressed himself to the blocking of the government and refle@@ cting what this means for him :
the blo@@ gs to un@@ lock is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the blocking of blo@@ gs may not be meaning@@ ful for the world , it is yet for me for two reasons :
1 ) It is necessary to send me the feeling of a siege to me ; an arrest , an en@@ su@@ ed murder , pres@@ cription at the national Security Council , the blocking blo@@ gs and any other web site for which I worked .
2 ) You have proven that I did not wrote in vain . in other words , my words have influence , even though only a small audience .
I wish to mention that this blog was a Archive for me .
first , I used it to item of articles to circum@@ vent the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship .
now , after they have blocked him , and that they may fear words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the mu@@ g goes through the way to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities opened on 24 May to 06 August 133 websites . this gave technical tests to the network of various Internet Service Provider ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and Et@@ is@@ al@@ at .
AF@@ TE also documented the remote control of providers in addition to the collection of Internet @-@ sur and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in their research :
on Monday , 12 June , we realized how the fle@@ x@@ ing of websites that have been offering the V@@ P@@ N@@ s .
such practice indicates the intention of the government to block the contents and filters access to the Egyptian user .
the situation is additionally wor@@ sen@@ ed in addition , that the Egyptian population has no legal basis for the Egyptian population , with the aid of judgment on these actions .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants dispute .

day for day newspapers come across Brazil with exciting head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city of the country and home to several post @-@ postcard postcard .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; th@@ iev@@ es popul@@ ist pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; President Tem@@ plate sends 8,@@ 500 soldiers of the army , n@@ avy and air af@@ ee to Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in an an@@ amped financial situation , the power threshold of 2017 reached the highest stand for 10 years .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice also called to access the United Nations .
reports like these are all daily and this is in@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least , at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so , for the detailed reporting of violence in Rio known Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on August 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which she announced a new section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports about violence in the city will be published there .
the moti@@ fs for their decision explained the newspaper thus :
extra will continue to report about crimes reported in every big city on the world as murder , smo@@ b , sexual violence , etc . everything that happens in Rio , will be published in the &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative to close as journalists not to close our eyes from the atro@@ cities .
in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oct@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ ede@@ an , the editor &apos;s editor that this decision was not a reason for pride , but rather a sign of the failure .
extra is probably the only newspaper on all over the world with a war ru@@ in in a country that didn &apos;t recognize the war .
the same video explains a journalist that according to the Bank &apos;s Internal Security Institute in Rio de Janeiro there are 8@@ 43 territories that are controlled by criminal organizations .
in the editorial article the newspaper writes :
it is aware that a war dis@@ course , if it is dist@@ orted to be used , abom@@ inations of the police , who just shoot first and then ask questions to conce@@ al .
but we defend war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of m@@ af@@ ia and their partners .
would the designation &quot; War &quot; more than it used ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Bras@@ il argu@@ ed the journ@@ alism in Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , a just@@ ification of failed security policy through the media and could make it difficult to rein@@ force responsibilities in the police .
this is no war .
this is the result of corruption and worse planning - how extra in the analysis of the military interest rates in Rio itself has shown - in combination with in@@ sufficient investments in personnel , ligh@@ ten@@ ment and a historical and self @-@ deduc@@ tible neg@@ le@@ cted of public service .
reminder : the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than just its capital .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Rio de Janeiro &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rio de Janeiro &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Brazil &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is false according to Cec@@ í@@ lia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are located in the north and northeast of the country . these are the most recent data available . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are no one of these cities in the state of Rio de Janeiro .

in addition to these safety policy measures , the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia Pacific Pe@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the police unit , whose goal is to conquer to conquer a massive police offer a Fav@@ ela and a unity permanent there .
at the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of for@@ ci@@ ble deaths . for some years , the U@@ PP , however , after several reports on Sch@@ ic@@ ans and repression against the poor congregations , which should actually protect the Neo @-@ created police unit , increasingly under f@@ uss .
on his Facebook page , the journalist João Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux quoted from one of his articles from 2010 , in which he declared that the force specified in Rio does not equal the criteria specified by the Geneva Convention - Crit@@ eria for the &quot; Civil War . &quot;
he writes :
besides legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio is due to serious consequences for human beings .
for this calls for the state , means and ways to use the typically for a war . this is the penet@@ rating into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; which is a sharp point in the landscape and to object for &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; and &quot; star@@ red balls . &quot;

the way from Afghanistan from Afghanistan to successful entrepren@@ eurs

during a night in the fall of 1994 , the Taliban conquered Afghanistan through the Taliban .
two years before , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ jah@@ ed@@ in group@@ ings , which had defeated short @-@ lived per @-@ Soviet government . thus , Afghanistan had become a country of terror and desp@@ air .
at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ ha@@ zn@@ i , in the province of G@@ ha@@ zn@@ i , together with his family at dinner together .
even if his mother did not say then , she knew that she would not see her son very long - maybe even more .
in the morning , the boy should break up .
his un@@ cle would fet@@ ch him , and bring him to the lock .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ election leader , was murdered by the Taliban , and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt un@@ question@@ able .
for their hat@@ red on the Haz@@ ara well known Taliban came closer .
many haz@@ ards left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan .
a few years he worked in a coh@@ er@@ ru@@ be . the work was heavy and made it ill .
then he took that which was left out of his low wages , and went into Iran . once again , he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and towing bags with mort@@ ars , which were heavier than he himself to make his life .
back then , the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was characterised by mis@@ ery and exploitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was really hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when A@@ shar@@ af remembered an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site at which we worked together . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were no services there and no heating . we hanging nylon in front of the open window , so that we do not w@@ ished at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and made himself ready for the journey to Europe .
during the dangerous over@@ ride on the sea he suffered ship@@ wreck and stran@@ ded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum request , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time was A@@ shar@@ af homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that divided twice on day eating .
it is true that Italy due to relatively high ad@@ owing quot@@ as is a sort of second chance for expired asylum seek@@ ers . however , it is also true that conditions for asylum seek@@ ers in the country are cat@@ astroph@@ ic .
the Human Rights Organization of the Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system suff@@ ers &quot; suffer from a general lack of transparency .
the vast majority of the asylum seek@@ ers are housed in more than 3000 &quot; specific reception centres . they are impro@@ vised with impro@@ vised equipment in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared staff . &quot;
according to the Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers only be assigned to a reception center , if they have officially applied for asylum , after registration of the asylum request for months .
until then there are people who have no money for a stay , either to the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street .
so , it came to A@@ shar@@ af .
but his indig@@ ent lifetime helped A@@ shar@@ af to release himself out of these conditions .
after he had worked several years in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ af gave his entire experience to the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
this was so good that he opened a second hostel with a while after a while .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ at@@ is success story is now the topic of the documentary &quot; disabled Venice - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( german : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director A@@ min Wah@@ id@@ i .
the film won the Venice City Award in 2017 , which has been awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the terms for entrepren@@ eurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Italian - are very difficult .
much bureau@@ cracy , high taxes and terms for loans are only some of the obstacles .
according to un@@ official estimates , approximately 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them the country is a transition solution on the way to other European countries .
in the past few years some of Afghanistan @-@ owned companies were created , including an edge , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afghan restaurants were praised even in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ m@@ adi had the idea to his restaurant Oriental experience in which the wa@@ iter and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells you through the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their journey to Italy .
the Afghan entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the p@@ izzeria Kab@@ ul@@ og@@ na in Bologna and a s@@ ush@@ i restaurant in Rome also in Afghanistan .
however , A@@ shar@@ af@@ s aims at well beyond the Italian gastronom@@ y industries and retail , and aim to go back to the country which he had to forced to leave as teen@@ ager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where an risk is , there are ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I never forget my country and I can &apos;t live happy if I know that my people suffer .
I have a project for farmers from the p@@ oo@@ rest provinces of the country , especially for women .
they represent half the society and must get the same options as all others . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af serves plans to learn plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul , where people can sell packaging and preserv@@ atives . &quot; so they can sell their seri@@ ousness on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; says he .
the development of successful entrepren@@ eurs was a journey through un@@ certainty and doub@@ ts , but at the end stand stability and prosper@@ ity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey itself . now he would like to help others in Afghanistan for this way .

if the law g@@ overning the law , it can mean up to three years in prison for the convicted .
in addition , this would under@@ go a political climate , in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of freedom has been in danger for many years .

recently , his trial was post@@ pon@@ ed on 20 May , because the prison line according to human rights groups were failed to bring the def@@ endants from prison to the court .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threatened the death penalty , such as many human rights groups , ad@@ mir@@ ation of other weapons of arms , illegal assembly , murder and su@@ peri@@ ors .
in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iza said the two journalist H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indicted for her coverage to pro @-@ Mor@@ si sitting block on the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalists Abdullah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested at the previously mentioned incident , from 25 years to 5 years .

the document published on April 21 on the site of Na@@ wa@@ at &apos;s website , casts a light on how the Presi@@ dential plans will look like the support of the legislative situation .
with regard to Article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian press , Ben G@@ har@@ bia suffered from the Tunis@@ ian press comm@@ its which sec@@ ures the right to protect their sources .
