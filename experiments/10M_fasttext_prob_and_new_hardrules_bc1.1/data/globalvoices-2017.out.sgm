<seg id="1">Although I had visited the U.S. for at least once a year, I would now live for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My dear to America is extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="4">As many of my generation I grew up with American movies, I have read American writers and run American authors.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had a sufficiently profound effect on me that I was mostly occupied by an American film journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">When I was 14 years old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless reporter, who wed the murderous conspiracy of a oil-Magnum, who wanted to lay his interest in the Supreme Court that had his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was prisoner.</seg>
<seg id="8">Free to Method You, "I was it, as if it is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year that I lived in Arizona, had only strengthened my admiration for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country where I ever lived, whose variety is so inviting you can always be that you are and it is easy to find in a community of equal people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very warmest love chat about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and the racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most exceptional aspect of his ascension is for me, as it goes with its commitment.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops behind the mountain, as it says so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he think, as a former colleague it express, and publicly declared his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afroamerican and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people have responded to his statements and approved in pairs for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won with the Republican Presidential elections, was the highest number ever recorded by the party.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigote person, asked me?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not bring Trump and his voters in line with people who I learned during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">As for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program, people from around the world, a deep believing man, with whom I could talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Trumps World illustrates not with the current publisher of the "Cincinnati Inquirer," in agreement with the current editor of Peter Bhatia.</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for Basketball and we spent many hours to view the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps Intolerance is also in contrast to the generosity that I experienced in Sandy Bahr, who fights for their lives for the environment, and their husband Dave, my host family who treated me like their son.</seg>
<seg id="26">It is still suitable for the commitment of Kristi Kappes, which helped me with much patience and suffering from my colleagues to accuse us to the complexity of the American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, were my mentors who helped me much with my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those by embodied values deepened my love in America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump is bound to nominate Republican presidential candidate, they gave me a stop and the counterpart to its limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it found out that they were the exception of rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016, more than 50 million Americans, mostly White, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps because of his contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The struggles with the idea that people voted for Trump, because they were either proclaimed his racism and fanaticism, because they were prepared to oversee these things, almost the heart broke.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to describe the Trump-voters as a cassists.</seg>
<seg id="34">Those who arrange people said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficially and respectless and indicates an inability to understand those who act on a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their worries and fears about huggish changes are not taken into account in their congregations.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters who are most white, voted for Trump, because they would like to gain control over a country that disappointed it?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they wanted to say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe might be.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commented on the cruel decision to come down a man who look down with contempt on those who look differently than he.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (Anm).: as much as "Rejection of the White against all other Ethnias," vocabulary from white in playing on the white and whiplash, which means that great Van Jones called, did exactly what America made so great.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world estimate the American Ideal - regardless of the myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - what faith or background you can always have, America means everyone is welcome.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose to be the son of a Kenianers twice the son of a Kenianers, whose history, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the election Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of white America's promise and says: to hell with confusion, religion and all the term of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the America after 9 / 11 the white man is alive again.</seg>
<seg id="46">In all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the day of election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a rally for Hillary Clinton had Mr. Khan a word change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, have my son, captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" he asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd answered with a loud voice. "no!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"could Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" roar the amount.</seg>
<seg id="52">"did Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered them.</seg>
<seg id="54">Have Afro Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they called them and their voices were loud.</seg>
<seg id="56">"would anyone who don't think is like you, a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a lonely and loud voice "NEIN."</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan closed with the words: "thanks be to Mr. Trump, this is not your America." 36 hours later he was conferred.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land, for which his son was, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Trumps Land, said the news.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could no place there in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks me my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What did the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero municipality in the province of Oaxaca with the kids of the paraguaean city of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music, which is played in both places, does not only change the life of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is situated on the outskirts of a large landfill, only 16 kilometres south of Oaxaca & # 8212; a old colonial city which is very popular among the tourists, but the worlds away from the nearby prestige ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For some years now La Banda de MÃºsica (Music bande) has been playing in the municipality: one from children and adults, existing symphony orchestra, which with their musical instruments have found a way to overcoming the surrounding poverty.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The church, which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drug abuse and the bonds of bonds.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth had always offered a rare hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their obligations towards the music group, the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI writes:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They will always come and play with shining eyes and play in the Trubel you are studying day for day trumpet, trombone, Piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timberos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from Waste</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7.000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero to play the children of Cateura - a village that is practically above at the biggest garbage dump of AsunciÃ³n in the capital - on instruments made from recovered waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with recovered instruments, made from local solid waste materials, manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recycling started under the direction of Favio ChÃ¡vez in order to transform parts of the exhaust in instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violin, violas, celli, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion that were all made out of the trash.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music and music by the Beatles, from Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in the Los Angeles Times Favio ChÃ¡vez reminds of a local economist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, at the initial time:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place for rehearsals and we had to teach in the same place, the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents, because many of them do not live with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed slightly as Favio, which he had never seen before: a violin made of waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today, there is a whole orchestra that plays on instruments from recovered material and is called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary Names "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) shows the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world produces approximately one billion tonnes of waste each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and of him are the poorest, like men in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn him into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">The Orchestra harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra played his music even before Pope Francis:</seg>

<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that is fighting the wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published in Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically advised about international, practiced solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-publication happens in the context of an agreement with Global Voices for common use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">It was then known in West Africa that this ship had already operated illegal fishing boats before the other coast of Africa had already visited Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The Eastern African countries were confronted in accordingly and inclined to hot the crushers of this type to their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comessors, Mozambique and Seychelles, mobilized quickly against the ship. they refused to attack one of its harbours and refused to share a fishing stone.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "suddenly the Premier was surrounded by countries, who simply refused to be refused," "" "Kiilu, a senior executive of the Kenyan fishing industry. he is part of a team that discovered the ship of the ship and persecuted." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was driven out of the region's waters: it was not able to catch up there fish.</seg>
<seg id="105">Finally, it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, due to pillage of the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, the criminal practices crossed and resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries which stop from NRO Stop illegally Fishing (Illegal Fisheries).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are adjacent to Somalia and Madagascar, the six countries that then drove the Premier from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "we have eight countries which are equalled and work together. you can exchange information and stand on each other where it comes to illegal fishing," "" "says Tony Long, Head of the Pew Charly Trusts project Ending. this project offers FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is regulated by definitive: what is caught, is hidden from being extremely difficult to split. thereby, the illegal fishing is a main cause of overfishing regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">By the deliberation of existing laws, by which certain habitats and species are protected, the illegal fishing ecosystem may harm a delicate equilibrium.</seg>
<seg id="111">However, during the actions against the illegal fishing were once impregnated through bureaucratic hurdles, and with the information between individual countries, these actions are now in real time, with traceable on FISH-i's digital communications platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, for example, the individual countries can exchange the lists of existing licences, news about their own activities or details that one had noticed or experienced during a port spection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i pursued the activities of ships even very attentive if they move on the open sea, via satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This enables the authorities to mark ships to mark the ships of fishing in forbidden areas - such as such that a ship suggest that a ship loads his caught fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">In idecases, such investigations can indicate whether the involved ships have a fishing license, where they were on the road and possibly even if they have a stracomest.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing, may be able to refuse the assumption of such vessels in their ports. what means that the ships could not sell their charge. and that they could even be forced to the numbers of penalties, as in the case of the Premier.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "then there is considerable financial losses for the owners, which means that the illegal fishing catch is financially worthwhile." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that's what we want to reach, "says Per Erik Bergh, leading director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a celebrity company that sets itself for the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created, in order to win estimated $20 million to lost sales, representing eight members of the HISH network every year due to the illegal fishers who penetrate in Eastern African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa is one of the most productive tuna fish fisheries, which is due to the region's commercial fishing from all over the world. among these illegal fishers.</seg>
<seg id="122">Among their practices include actions such as sailing under false flag, fake licensing papers, specifying imagery species, fishing protected species and fish in nature conservation.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "" "" "utilize the missing international cooperation and do the weaknesses of an unstable control system," "" "says Long." "" "a ship was illegal and a country could say 'You must not run my harbour." ""</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Come to me'. "and exactly this legal sliphole tries to close FISH-i now.</seg>
<seg id="125">The closed front has been completed.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspects ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered the criminal network that had counterfeit licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities used and it has been pursued and found ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its collaboration with INTERPOL, the international authority for the combating of crimes, FISH-i can share information about illegal fishing across large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "some of our researches lead us far into the networks of organizational crimes," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>

<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system that has always been developed further, helps to hide the illegal ships to hide themselves.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "illegal fishers use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position." "" "Duncan Copeland, Chief analyst with Trygg Mat Tracking, a NRO, which also offers technical support with fisheries and fishing industry.</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships switch for example their automatic identification systems where they can no longer be used by satellite.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland therefore helps to build a system that combines different information carriers. the FISH-i will help to find criminal ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A program model</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team of african nations actually take effect on the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the platform Global Fishing Watch on Google and the Oceana Marine protection organization: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide through the position of any traceable ship.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "met with the neighbours to get a better picture of it, who does whatever - this makes sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">We should do this on global level. "Pew Charly Trusts has a similar project when a global system permits the persecution of ships.</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities do not only feel famous detective stories, but also screams.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that previously used without license fished and hardly to reckon with consequences we know that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i have now reached a 33% increase in fisheries, ever since fishing boats more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had helped Greko 1, the inspectors found there on board towing networks, whose use is prohibited.</seg>

<seg id="148">There are six countries assembled in 2015, to the so-called West Africa Task Force. now, they fight the illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH-i. "" "" security is the goal of leaving more such initiatives and structures in other regions, "" "" says Copeland. "" "</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's most recent member of Somalia was able to report its first great triumph: in October there were Greko 1, a ship that was under false flag. not only was the ship travelling without a license and were not allowed to be forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="150">The ship was also reserved in forbidden waters, which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia. "with the rules of rules against Greko 1, it was a strong sign that they should go against illegal fishing." "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>

<seg id="163">In the context of the social, political and economic crisis, the inflation rate is estimated at 500% at the annual financial statements, and in which a serious and extensive lack of food and medicine is the only way to give the country the chance to relocate its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance.</seg>

<seg id="351">The error was the translator Julian Holmes, a population of Kyotos, fell down. it was also, who made the local newspapers to the attention.</seg>
<seg id="352">The daily Kyoto Shimbun was published in Kyoto:</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could it come to an English translation?</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation.</seg>
<seg id="355">This is an adjoining for elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable, "Holmes" said.</seg>
<seg id="356">The faulty English translation was initially removed. the name "-drivers" (German: "terrible drivers") was later replaced by the reasonable name "Elder drivers" (German: "older drivers").</seg>
<seg id="357">The police in the Kyoto prefecture were preschooled for the translation errors. furthermore they declared that the error was already contained in the text that they had received from translators and that the translation was not checked for their correctness before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported how follows the excuse:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "sorry, he was sorry that elderly people were offended by the inadequate correction (translation)" "" "said the police." ""</seg>
<seg id="360">Japanese online news service J-Cast News continued to learn more detailed with the phenomenon of the "terrible" older drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">The word "terrible" was displeased as an adequate description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of elderly drivers who are involved in accidents are involved, but they are all concerned.</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto Prefecture, for example, 1,941 were caused by a total of 19.460 accidents by seniors in 2005, which equates to a share of 10%.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation were multifaceted.</seg>
<seg id="377">You need two important features: passive voice knowledge to understand the output text and active speech knowledge in order to transmit it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires active rule of the target language - Something that is in case of native speakers. generally, in general, the conviction that the translators in the target language - not in the output language - native language should be.</seg>
<seg id="379">Thus a French mother tongue was to translate from English into French - not from the French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr-users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies employ no employees with English as native language, the translations into English. this might lack the lack of understanding, cost-reasons or the relatively small number of English speakers, which can learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that have no foreign employees allow translations to firing internally. then the Japanese company, whose English knowledge is considered to be the best, for translators - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr-users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Mechanical translations are also widespread - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The worrens and awful phrases that are created by mechanized translations, show that this technique can still be no human translators for a long time. this is true for several languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English Forcourages in Japan, including the awkful imprints that are often used t-shirts or bags are only used for styliistic reasons - not being read or understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo of Flickr-user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors like jewelry nor unacceptable, or at least harmless. but by large companies or from the government who have the means to ensure higher standards, you can expect more careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">The city of KYOTO also uses a serious source of translations in the future.</seg>

<seg id="394">Another online radio records carried out images of the protests in Caracas, which were organized by oppositional groups, who opposed the government of NicolÃ¡s Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began early April, after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the tasks of Parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos DÃ­az, journalist and author of Global Voices, published the results of a Traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection is coupled to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the internet.</seg>

<seg id="401">Traditional media have been working in coverage over protests since 2014. at that time, the Commission threatened for telecommunications with fines and closure if they continue to report on the demonstrations, as the Commission saw this as a "call for violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informational national TV channels I filed myself with @ vivoplaynet.</seg>
<seg id="403">Amazing that this is still cheaper than to purchase two litres of lionade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO Consinfiltro confirmed that not only Vivoplay is not accessible by a blocking of the Domain Name System (DNS) but also two more online channels. this also applies the website, on which the National Assembly transfers their sessions.</seg>
<seg id="405">Formerly researches of the institute for press and society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had revealed that local Internet providers may stay on DNS. in this case, it concerns technology due to the DNS server inquiries by certain domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">If an Internet is blocked by the DNS server, the server will be incorrect or denied the request when calling on a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm having a DNS lock: @ elikoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">With VPITV, a third locked channel, the transmission was discontinued on Thursday 6th April, when the VPITV cameraman Elvis Flores, who survived the protests in Caracas, was taken into custody.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was defeated, while he was in custody facilities.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later, he was released and VPITV was going on show again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, there was also announced that the government is regulated by the Internet connection: the Venzolanians make access to multi media coverage regarding the current events of the country.</seg>

<seg id="467">Alvarenga says she had never been hungry, but got not unlimited food. "I could pick up more books from the library of the master's library as a meal from the fridge," they are reminiscent of her.</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well equipped and belonged to the householder, a former military and sympathizers of Partido Liberal, a liberal party, who was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who belonged to the opposition from 1954 to 1989.</seg>
<seg id="469">In some evenings of the house of Alvarenga, in addition to him and guiding articles from opposition items such as "Sendero" or "El Pueblo."</seg>

<seg id="474">It was completely clear that they had paid for everything she had paid from them to their hard work.</seg>
<seg id="475">Also in school Alvarenga discriminates. "one thing that almost never been spoken, are mobbing and the icans to whom Criminitas are exposed to school whenever they go to school.</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children parents have, they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents, is a crimpita.</seg>
<seg id="477">I was able to invite you to home. I did not have a circle of friends in the school, or in the neighborhood.</seg>

<seg id="488">A woman from the village of Ãemby wrote that she would have had an old girl and gave her telephone number.</seg>
<seg id="489">Another woman who also came from Ãemby also offered her 15-year-old niece. "she likes little children and is very pretty," she wrote.</seg>

<seg id="500">Image of Pixabay, changes from Global Voices.</seg>

<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian parliamentary committee had recently approved a bill to "" "" voted "" "" Regulators and Social Networks "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="503">If he is accepted by Parliament, users must register social media in Egypt by a government authority to use social media, including Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="504">On the basis of the law would then be set up a place that is responsible for use the citizens and citizens to share social media.</seg>
<seg id="505">Within six months with acceptance of the law, users have to register users and users on the site of the site with its correct name and identity numbers to use social networking.</seg>
<seg id="506">If it failed to do this, this could bring a penalty of up to six months in jail or a fine of money.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill, which consists of six paragraphs, and in local media, including Youm7 and Egypt independent), defines social media as "every application that is running and used to communicate with others by voice, video messages and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is set out when the draft account is provided, as Egyptian authorities are supposed to determine the user how they are supposed to register for those who are unable to register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure the regulation on stage of social media companies.</seg>
<seg id="509">Riyad Abdul Saddle, parliaments and promoter of the Legislative Decree, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users and users received a password from the Telecommunications Department, and a password to come through the firewall which blocks Facebook. "</seg>
<seg id="510">This could mean that Egypt is planning to raise a firewall on national level around Facebook. because of them it would be necessary for Egypt inside and Egyptians to submit information on their identity to access the network.</seg>
<seg id="511">But it is so far not known that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts and experts on site are sceptical about technical feasibility of the flags.</seg>
<seg id="513">Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist (based on German "leading researcher") of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR), in German "Egyptian initiative for personal rights"), told Global Voices:</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "I doubted strongly to the technical capacity and the understanding of neither authority in Egypt regarding things that have done with technology." ""</seg>
<seg id="515">In my opinion, they imagine that just as they did forcible physical and private rooms, it could also be done online.</seg>
<seg id="516">If I take it, then it means that they will request a powerful surveillance system to request citizens, who apply a permission, or not. and this means a mad system to monitor the activities of people and to bring it to a court process.</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">In order to be adopted as a law, the draft will initially be discussed under the legislature of Parliament and the constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate.</seg>
<seg id="519">Whether his acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not, the draft "stands in line with a pro-military thinking in parliament in whose meaning, no deviating Narration on the image is present," says Raoof.</seg>
<seg id="520">Last year, Tamer El-Shahawy proposed a bill against Cyber crime crime in which a life-long prison sentence for those intended to threaten to threaten the "public order" and "to protest."</seg>

<seg id="526">A subtype of the larger family of Leopards, which spreads through Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor). in total, there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are due to wild animals, the loss and the fracture of their living area, as they do always find less prey, endangered.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this specific type of leopards so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">As Raza in the video shows, "the Persian leopard is the only remainder of the Kurdish ecosystem" and the health and the growth of the ecosystem, too, that a large predator is present.</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to watch a Persian leopard in the free bodiway is small and goes against zero. as the team in the video you determine that they have a recording of a large cat in the camera trap, Raza breaks out in pure joy.</seg>

<seg id="544">At the beginning of March 2017, the daily Kahoku Shimpo, the progress made for the North East Japan were to rebuild the life of those who were affected by the "triple disaster" of March 2011. an massive earthquake, a tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima happened.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, located in the prefecture of Miyagi. Miyagi prefecture was in Japan's northeast, both experiencing both the earthquake and the tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring countries of Fukushima and Iwate were evacuated, because the tsunami had vanish all the coastal cities of the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">Even more, the prefecture of Fukushima experienced a nuclear accident, just about 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of Kahoku Shimpo shows a local viewpoint of which progress has been reached after six years later in order to rebuild the lives of local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority as well as the survey results of those affected themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The residential building in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo's newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare parts (that was completed by December 2015, saigai kouei juutaku) in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate were finished.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi showed the biggest success among the three prefectures, 80 percent of the planned spare parts were finished.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has finished 75 percent of such houses while around Fukushima joined the final turnaround with 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">Yet again, six years after the catastrophe, evacuated from Behelfswald (beginning-time, kasetsu juutaku) to be relocated in final replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple disaster, nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in Behelfswald.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, there were still 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such conditions.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the evacuated companies of Fukushima still live in emergencies, whereas Miyagi had a succesful success. more than 75 percent of the evacuated those after the disaster in Behelbows were moved in final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwades this figure is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The status of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimpo Newspaper could determine that 1074 of 1100 schools, who were affected by the misfortune, opened its doors down to December 2016, which makes almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial reconstruction is far more difficult in the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="562">While almost 100 per cent of fishing ports in Iwades and Miyagi have now returned to operate in Fukushima only 30 percent of the fishing ports have been resumed.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and nuclear accident, have moved in the three prefectures agricultural land large-area-wide.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi could recover 93 percent of its agricultural land, but only 66 percent of the arable land in Iwate and less than 50 per cent destroyable farmland in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a result of the atomic fact, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed arable land of Fukushima are located in the "nuclear plywood area."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, the tourism has largely recovered, but Fukushima still remains unbeaten.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist figures in Miyagi and Iwate are again up to 90 percent in the same stand as before the misfortune. Fukushima can only show up to 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo Newspaper also reports that almost half of the inhabitants are almost half of the coastal inhabitants, it is more difficult to earn their livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to determine a total photograph, the newspaper carried out numerous surveys under the local population and under the evacuated population. she asked them about the status of rebuilding and also how their indignation has changed over the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In the introduction of the article, the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo led a survey to bring out more about the tsunami consciousness under the native population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey carried out that 83.1 percent of local residents took measures to be taken in order to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents have still not been done enough in the catastrophes of disasters.</seg>
<seg id="575">As it stands to be evacuated from the Fukushima prefecture of Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="576">In its issue of the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has strengthened its attention also to the position of evacuated from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had not only had to experience the massive earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, the prefecture of Fukushima was also witness of the worst, disaster-caused, atomic fact that had to experience the Japan ever.</seg>
<seg id="578">Almost 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the Prefecture of around 160 000 evacuated from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 there were a little over 23 000 people, back to Fukushima, in permanent spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the 2017 state of 2017, there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima off their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster areas most of the evacuation areas are more than 50 years old. they are able to relocate in proper home conditions, because the efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima will compete with massive construction projects. here are building projects that are part of the Olympic Games which will be held in Tokyo in 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">If people encountered from other countries, which speak another language, the differences seem to be greater than the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, however, one recognizes that there seems to be more than it appears at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important, since they come out our proposals to enlarge our perspectives and remember that the world is finally very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this sequence of Into the Deep, the Global Voices Podcast, we look at exactly this global connections. in our Into the Deep podcast we handle topics that will often earn less attention than they earn.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak to five Global Voices members who remember a moment in which they felt very strongly associated with someone about voice and international borders.</seg>
<seg id="588">Veronika Kriconi speaks about the similarities of Greek and Turkish; Tori Egheri is reminiscent of the lack of common language skills during a journey in rural China; Adriana Macias talks about the time where they worked with people from all over the world in London; and Joey Ayoub looks back on his experiences that he has collected in a small village in Madagascar.</seg>

<seg id="595">A Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit: last Friday, a police officer was defeated at a demonstration in GoiÃ¢nia with a stroke at the head. nationwide millions of demonstrators participated in a protest against austeroids.</seg>
<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, studied social sciences at the Federal University of GoiÃ¡s, has suffered several fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors operated him on Saturday and have now transferred it into an artificial coma.</seg>
<seg id="598">His condition is considered serious.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local photo journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus which rapidly managed quickly in Brazil within a few days.</seg>
<seg id="600">The pictures can also recognize the face of the police officer, which was identified with a stroke attack. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">After the incident, the military police in the Brazilian state of GoiÃ¡s announced that Sampaio was suspended until the end of the case of the case of active service.</seg>
<seg id="602">The pictures show the police officers, as it strikes in GoiÃ¢nia with his impact on the face of the student Mateus Ferreira (photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">If a police officer was beaten by a demonstrators and landing on the Intensive care unit, his face would be seen six months in television and the entire suppression would be justified.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook page "Desolalizador," a press channel of media activist from GoiÃ¢nia, divided the video in the net, in which one sees how Mateus is attacked from the police officer, and several washrooms shortly thereafter.</seg>
<seg id="605">Another video with the same scenes, but from another perspective, is also immersed in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="606">In the below shown clip you can see the attack on Mateus from the 50th second.</seg>
<seg id="607">For the family of Mateus, who lives in another state, Internet users now lives 10,000 Brazilian reais (approximately 2,700 euros) to cover a part of the costs for medical treatment and to keep his family in GoiÃ¢nia, while at hospital.</seg>

<seg id="612">On Facebook, Professor Pablo Ortellado calls for more violent crimes against activists in GoiÃ¡s:</seg>
<seg id="613">GoiÃ¡s experienced a wave of political power: here, the activity of a Whatsapp Group had been killed here, because he was attacked the Occupy Movement in secondary schools. now, we have been attacked the very sad case of Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who has been attacked by a policemen who struck him with a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="614">Police handles</seg>
<seg id="615">GoiÃ¡s was not the only state in Brazil in which it came to demonstrators against demonstrators over the past Friday.</seg>
<seg id="616">Policemen trained in protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro, where demonstrators had built a stage for Redner, rubber migrants and lacriengas.</seg>
<seg id="617">On violence against demonstrators, members of Flavio Serafini, Social and Peace Party (PSOL), the police operated on violence against demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="618">This also includes a report in Folha de S. Paulo, one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="619">Once again, the Brazilian media street protests swept, declining the focus on another, unexpected protagonists: a window of window.</seg>
<seg id="620">The folha de S. Paulo and estado de S. Paulo were specifically designed for a broken glass window with a photo of their cover pages.</seg>
<seg id="621">In contrast, the O globalo is preferred by a title story with a set of fire.</seg>
<seg id="622">There is no plausible journalistic cause, more about a broken window disc than the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special thing.</seg>
<seg id="623">This is necessary to recognise that if you strive against any form of atomic damage.</seg>
<seg id="624">Here, the term "Vandalism," an absurd, an undisproportionate, and the typical violent of the military police are marked by headlines with the title "demonstrators on confrontation course with the police."</seg>
<seg id="625">The villages of Abindustro Forgotten Villages to Cuba</seg>
<seg id="626">With the introduction of the Act of Ãlvaro Reynoso closed almost hundreds of sugar tubes throughout Cuba (photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The parish community Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±alich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is widely known as a Central - at Spanish Sugar mill - regardless of what there are no significant sugars on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities were manufactured in the sugar tubes factories.</seg>
<seg id="629">After getting the sugar-tube industry in the region, and the factory lost after and after its plants, until only the rumour of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">Some 272 workers had to find themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some change the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Many resigned and commutes daily to the factories which still grinding.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a solo 'veteran, who rises every day at 4: 00 in the morning, the crisis in the sugar tubes industry smokes not his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that it exists in the east of the region of sugar tubes, which are back in operation after long inactive time because they have been preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something that it was not expected.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene reminds himself exactly that in MaÃ±alI would receive the sugar cane factory, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar industry resistance has already been the plagues, the case of socialism, the case of socialism, the low market prices, the severe administrative decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016 the production of 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the 1910 were produced.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a motive for a couple of decades a motive for the country, but the bad harvest are not even Neuvity.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar industry turned off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway station of the commune looked already better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar tubes industry was an economic need: the 155 sugar tubes were technically obsolete, and hardly competitive they were incompatible for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to focus on the most efficient factories, the annual production goal was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They only left the factories which can produce sugar for at most 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motifs that led to such measures were the low productivity of the sugar cane plants and the sugars on the global market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price increased about one decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 through 2025, the price of unrefined sugar has to stay between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the 2016 report, "Land Sustainable Development" from the OECD and FAO, the Agriculture and Nutrition organization of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar export would generate circa 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not all ran well</seg>
<seg id="652">"today's day will go down with security in history," that was the first words of the Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lavandero.</seg>
<seg id="653">From there began the process of restructuring in the sugar industry.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years the shutting of a total of 98 sugar tubes, more than 65 million people received their full salaries for further training.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same thing happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio ArlÃ©e MaÃ±alich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto PÃ©rez worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">If Nene, as it is known as a soldier, is talking about the closure of the factory, is the word that he repeated most, "scam."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all of those surveyed are the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order to receive the place they were a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">In front of the first year of lieutenant, the first letters started to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was officially adopted documents that only be removed in terms of parts that would be removed, the address sat and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ultimo Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve each withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">And from there, the responsibility was taken over and the letters were more common.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the lactate factory for two years, and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for those in running sugar tubes, assures us.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years, waiting for the retirement in another facility, the Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was also involved in the shutting of the factory in which construction he helped, in which construction he helped.</seg>
<seg id="667">With every part that he removed, he disassembled one of his 31 years of work.</seg>
<seg id="668">The best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important jobs have been extinguished.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, no alternatives for work equivalents and services were produced in the congregations where they were present.</seg>
<seg id="670">We will never know if during the mammoth speech of October 21, 2002, the former president in the eyes of the present people saw when he was guaranteed for those who were not running since five years, everything would run well.</seg>

<seg id="675">When the sugar cane factory closed, or better, when they began to abonate them, they also heard on paved road, this disadvantaged also other farms.</seg>
<seg id="676">Without work in the region, and with already advanced age, nene and Eddy others had to search for other factories.</seg>
<seg id="677">They were shared to spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="678">Without any future perspective, many young people left the region once again.</seg>
<seg id="679">In the area the food factory was created whose production is not once used for the supply of the commune.</seg>
<seg id="680">The ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive.</seg>
<seg id="681">At the end of 2016, Nene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Coloma, the ruins of the place where he began to work.</seg>
<seg id="682">Neunundforty exploited the old soldiers a pension of two thousand Peso per month to spend the years retired in MaÃ±alich.</seg>
<seg id="683">Mr. Nene, a man of black skin colour, small, with a few teeth and clear voice, is no retrofitting person, yet he gives the lies that one told him, not.</seg>
<seg id="684">They have been dealing with him for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="685">Nene is working with 65 years of age, not because it is missing in power, but because he is bitter.</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people of the first Nations communities in Canada are dealing with topics which are important for them. they do not do with hip-hop, thanks to a number of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">Since 2014, as part of the N 'we Jinan Tour, workshop and youth centers have been performing directly to schools and youth centers to include youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live appearances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the pedagogue David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and in North Quebec with ten Cree communities and then worked with the Cree Hip-Hop Group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop continues to ensure that the young participations in our discussions related topics such as "cultural identity, language, struggles, love, self-acceptable" or what to them in mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos, in which the young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other first Nations communities in Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the trunk of Winnebago in the US state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the area of the tribe of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia tells us the story of Highway 16, also called "Highway of tears," on which almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were not resolved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemo Cree First nation uses the motive of a video player to mediate, as important as the preservation of traditional Sitten and customs, despite influences through the globalization.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs have appeared in indigenous languages, although the youngsters have not always rule the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagi Cree First Nation recorded, the refraction will be sung in Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The youngsters took some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars Hip-Hop group who gave them a Strophe in dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebookpage of N'we Jinan, the Strophe is available in the address, as well as a translation into English, which is translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like would not ever be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I continue to continue my days on the earth</seg>
<seg id="707">That is the day when you'll understand our cry.</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we lost our way to life in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I think we will be able to raise us a day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">So you can grow and lead the same as our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">So you can do it, for which the Creator has determined</seg>
<seg id="713">In the commentary part of the reader and the author of Cree language Kevin Brousseau also adds a contribution and add the Strophe in Silicon (which is also published on his blog and will be published here with permission):</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see almost every restaurant of plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers what exactly on the menu is to be found in the vicinity of the entrance shokuhin to puru (ocative, "plastic models of dishes") of each food which is served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers can see these plastic dishes and decide if they enter or go on the restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is an entire industry devoted to manufacture of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Cappabashi district of Kappabashi there is a variety of these small businesses that manufacture the plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese cars are these plastic dishes so usually that they did not find them once more. a new trend is transformed, however, into amazing mobile accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matome published the blogger itinii series of social media links and photos that demonstrate this unusual twist with the shokuhin.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new with plastic grated mobile tapes were shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu Kaufhaus.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods have been changed to kitch items, as in this case, fridge kmagnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shoa fridge kmagnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in the essences will increasingly vanish.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case an imperial-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was transformed into a mobile phone support.</seg>
<seg id="730">For these triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile phone support.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also have this part for the Tokyo exhibition in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an Apple to hold your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, using a guy for the mobile, it is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that's only the beginning of an increasing flight into the Comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phone support and mobile phone designers allow you to produce your own artwork. in this case, ikura or salmon are used, a popular topping with white rice is served.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">Is there someone who say would say: "Wow, cool, now I can get rid of my mobile phone with salmon?."</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only tiny one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also assume a less appetite form to surprise some colleagues or family members.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile phone support has the shape of shmelodic ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also travel balls (onigiri), earrings and gloves made of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Other skurrile plastic dishes can be seen at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter to the hashtag #.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you like to know more about the origin of this trends, then you will give you an insight into the Cappabashi district, which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry. such as the shokuhin of the restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="744">The following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes can actually be produced.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports in- and foreign media about the notorious "fighting against drugs trade" in Mexico do not scuba diving regularly in statistics. however, this mirror is not reflected at all the extent of human tragedy that this battle is with him.</seg>
<seg id="750">The reporting on drug bosses like El Chapo GuzmÃ¡n, the Chief of the Sinaloa Cartells, pushed the stories of the conflict in the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">On the day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the grief or to the churches that have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind each bone, behind each bone refunds in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners are perhaps to heal.</seg>
<seg id="753">That is why the Mexican news portal animal PolÃ­tico is the digital project "Aprena Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "dealing with the drug trade,") to give this victims a vote and stories of people telling the battle between the prosecution and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal PolÃ­tico describes the project:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organizational crimes can not only fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are far profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, if shops close because they are threatened by drug traders and all the municipalities need to drive a lot of kilometers to buy something like milk.</seg>

<seg id="773">The editors of "Apruna vivir con el narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">We do not only need to show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts of fragility and the governance.</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some extracts from stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a woman of animal PolÃ­tico, wrote this post in Taxco, in the State of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Their contribution is reminiscent of us that violence should never be considered normal, no matter, in which form them occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have been familiar with disease and Sensational journalism for some years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I come to newspaper kiosken every day and see the title page with pictures, which actually can only come from a textbook for criminology or from specialists from specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It takes me from the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I've got the feeling, as if I am the one, the angement or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body once.</seg>
<seg id="783">I can't be equal to or this is considered normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it is not normal that my 10-year-old cousin think that he is great. and it is not normal that people listen to people over the "heroism" of the offenders, when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me, that is, than would they have lost those who have lost someone and those who have fear that something happened.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness, if stories are to block numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">The facts of human beings is unbelievably for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village will be justified that they were "rising."</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to agree that they are spared from such tragedy when they are not stirring and still.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution "Four months of awakening in the main city district:" like a family with drumings, "it describes how armed crime month had been destroyed for month's money, until they had not only destroyed the store, but also their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think all that you lost and remember how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain never goes up that trauma remains high, the fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, contact numbers also.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The more we are removed from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She completed her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want to be arrested that the others are arrested, because you don't know when they will cause you to kill or kill.</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked myself in these awful days, if you would dissolve my deepest root feelings, but the answer is no, for I forgot how to weep. I have to learn how to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario GutiÃ©rrez Vega published the contribution "The forgotten children of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez: a generation of violence."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions on how to: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by the organized crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care for them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a Waise and he tells that he had to kill himself as one egg coater, boiled potatoes, tortillas warm and "Chichi" for the babies that makes it home with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left hand - one for each year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are not significantly compared to pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a young man for all the life of violence and who had to learn to live with them.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood had been over two years before, when he was just a few blocks away from his home, the bloody dead bodies of his father, who had been shot by armed men from an absent car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in JuÃ¡rez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 when violence through the organized crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, JuÃ¡rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of bills for public security and the government of the United States government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the Prosecution filed 3103 counts. this is equivalent to 8.5 Morden per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just some of hundreds of thousands of stories that leaves the organized crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only few stories live in view of new headlines. this project reminds us of those who are not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprena Vivir Con El Narco" brought the data journalism project Narcodata into life, whose goal is to present the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trade, which the country has tormented in the past four decades, in a simple way.</seg>

<seg id="819">But what is the year that something is dipped for the first time? content in social media, no matter whether it is true or true, tend to exist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this photo of a terrible accident, seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first release, it has been used irreprisingly, tragedies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false coupling of image and event - "false description" or "false context" in terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - denied the fact that there are plentifully careful coverage of events in the DRC, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it throws questions about our desire to go to pictures.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tanker left the place Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tilt and exploded. 230 people lost their lives.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war in Africa, Africa had been neglected and devastated. the streets in the region became dangerous paving full of drums, which were difficult to ride.</seg>
<seg id="827">It fell victim to the fuel tank wagons.</seg>

<seg id="829">Houses distressed and carbonated dead bodies were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to the infinite.</seg>
<seg id="831">A painting with the title "This is Nigeria." by Imgur users Mystical Monkey, 12 January 2015.multiple photos of the occurrence form the grey scenes of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example.</seg>
<seg id="833">It displays rows of carbonated body, which can be rounded up on the floor during persons.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not find its end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years the same photo was wiped by several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, but may not be attributed to the tragedies, particularly events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On January 3, 2015 the fighters of the Boko Haram held the legeneous nigerian towns of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyelids reported drastically of atrocities, before whom they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burnt down and dead bodies were burned in streets and bones.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports that 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "no one stayed back to count corpses," "" "said a person to Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were crooked, shot or burnt.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only using satellite images the follow-up time could be illustrated.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack remained unexplained, but the army-based point in Baghdad was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the attempt of Boko Haram, country to win (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from the DR Kongo on, as it was frowly presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">The massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this missile use of the image of the DR Congo is only one in a number of false abortions; Africa Check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the picture was vorced as a letter for massacres.</seg>
<seg id="852">Another step further bring personal comments as this example the picture from the DR Congo with the sources of mass media in connection to deliver arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture from Sange also joined forces in conjunction with the deadly prosecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a lightning message, published by the United Nations, those who were able to flee strokes, rape and some dead, some through burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others of violence against the Rohingya reported, Posts like the following descriptions were brought together with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture was taken from an Saudi Arabian News page, which had failed in 2012, the President Myanmars Thein said that monks and politicians had participated in the assassination of the Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image from the DR Congo to discern this information.</seg>

<seg id="860">Traces of these wrong decoupling ranges up to the years 2011 and 2012, and actually come from anywhere in all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="861">With the help of a "re-returned image" you can see how far more information can be reached.</seg>
<seg id="862">A converted picture search with the search engine TinEye has been showing 344 images under 18.8 billion images (as of May 3, 2017) 344 images showing the image of the DR Congo very similar.</seg>

<seg id="905">This correctance that appeared exclusively in English, includes references to counterfake images from scissants, the Hate Speech operate and by extremist groups to define that Muslims Buddhists kill and andersrum (which often is widely used by burese nationalists).</seg>

<seg id="907">This post that addressed to the members of the Russian-orthodox congregation, clearly states that the image of the DR Congo is NOT Muslims who should kill Christians.</seg>
<seg id="908">Saudi Arabia, 2012 / 2014.</seg>
<seg id="909">This news page is claimed that the President of Myanmar was suspicious in 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Rohingya Muslims, and brought the story together with the picture from Sange.</seg>
<seg id="910">The article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this release is the picture continues.</seg>
<seg id="911">Spain, 2015 / 2016.</seg>
<seg id="912">This article from 2014 on students who had been murdered by the Boko Haram, published by the Catholic Church on AnÃ¡lisis Digital, has explicitly stated that the picture was not taken from the redness, but it claims that it was a "similar dShips attack."</seg>
<seg id="913">When the picture later became in circulation with the massacre of Boko Haram from 2015, the newspaper El Pais tried to cancel that there would be connections to Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="914">Turkey, 2015. "# NijeryaYanÄ±yorusyaUyuy" (Nigeria burns the world sleeps).</seg>
<seg id="915">The picture of the DR Kongo is equipped with this twitterhashtag, and dissolved a discussion under the Muslims at the Boko Haram 2015 massacre and on the flags on Charlie Hebdo in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="916">They wanted to achieve that their communities took place that they took place in the name of the Islams, a greater attention.</seg>
<seg id="917">United States, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="918">The picture was made as letter to the massacre of the Boko Haram 2015 (and more than 9,300 times retaining), but the messages that were associated with these were not taken up in no religious context.</seg>
<seg id="919">Instead, the goal was to raise attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of the media coverage in comparison of Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Hebdo.</seg>
<seg id="920">Vietnam (Maltese), 2014.</seg>
<seg id="921">After a message which had been supposedly written by a "Father Juan Carlos Martos" on the Nigerian massacre had been written in circulation, it was translated into discussion as this here on Vietnamese and declared it to be a false report.</seg>
<seg id="922">From the message in which the image of the DR Congo had been included, the organisation of Claretiner missionare and Pater Juan Carlos Martos.</seg>
<seg id="923">There are further confirmed examples of an incorrect use of the picture from Sweden, Poland, Belgium, Netherlands and Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="924">Based on other accounts, aggregators, and pages in the following countries (at the portfolio in grey), however, these versions are not fully traceable: Czech Republic, Australia, India, Peru, Netherlands, Ethiopia, Sri Lanka, Azerbaijan, Japan and possibly China.</seg>
<seg id="925">(data entries with URLs and timestamps exist in the Webcrawler and occasionally they have image file names in connection with Nigeria or Rohingya Muslim.)</seg>
<seg id="926">In all these cases that appeared only clearly after the original accident of 2010, the picture shows a correct description but the original entry is not available or accessible.</seg>
<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong topics or frames (irradiation), who walk through this post. the first frame is focused on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in reference to greater discussions on the silence of Christians in connection with Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the exhortation of Rohingyas through Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second Framing uses the picture to discuss how a African life is undervalued compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Religion is to be understood and the value of human life is both important. therefore it is worthwhile to examine how images may be used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">However, a more detailed question is what happens when reading these images can not give any longer belief.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media there are merciful people who have unintended to trines the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggerated this mood of false and false information that actual atrocities are untrue and hales the real horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo in Nigeria and in Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of forcible pictures was already debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">An argument is that the reproof of pictures of a refusal to recognise the tragedy. sometimes these pictures are even required by the victims.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that forcible pictures of readers and viewers dessizing and give them the ability to empathy indigathy (such as this study, who sought to work as forcible media to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there are some forcible representations in the news media there is fact that they are indispensable for today's news coverage.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "Fake News." they will be thoroughly thinking about the situation in which a picture is something suggests, but it can also be replaced by context or completely misery kind.</seg>
<seg id="940">Any study of false grants should also take into consideration how international they can be.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name of Untranslatable (e. dt. unmistakable) endeavoured to offer a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate at all.</seg>
<seg id="945">Such words are in any language: you press some situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these unacceptable words are already well-known (like the famous portuguese dade) and others that are deeply rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish sobermea).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resist hard to each attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">One word or expression is not enough, so why a full explanation and sometimes a little context is required to understand exactly what is meant with this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected all over a long time in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists of Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and linguistics of "Untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">For example, in the blog you can find words from Vanuatu Vanuatu as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - Coloring your parents in recognition of how you have endeavoured to have yourself in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrik language, which are spoken in parts of Brazil, as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"" "" "" "kwadi" "" "- Comfortable, or sloth, which you feel after a cold day in the sun." ""</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds own words from his blog in:</seg>
<seg id="956">They disseminate other cultures, reveal another thought of thoughts and curiosity our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes, you influence how we analyze the world to analyze and classify the linguists on this page even more of this "uneasible" words and show how different, valuable and impressively these small languages are.</seg>
<seg id="958">Redner of the "Treasure Languages," which are much appreciated by untranslatable are invited to upload their favourite words here.</seg>

<seg id="1005">There are 1,7 billion Muslims worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1006">We do not see all the same.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We practice our religion differently.</seg>
<seg id="1008">We will identify themselves to be a Muslim, in different art. but somehow we all plugged into the same Muslim drawer.</seg>

<seg id="1025">I've been working in the news industry for thirteen years and I have seen how this powerful, faulty Narrative has dominate our newsfeeds.</seg>
<seg id="1026">This Narrativ reveals the reality that has led nine Muslim women to their countries during the last three decades, while the United States could not even chose their first female presidential candidate.</seg>
<seg id="1027">This Narrativ failed to recognise that if French, Muslim women are forced to carry out their headscarf in public buildings, Muslim women through their government to cover their entire body, which are both sides of the same coin.</seg>

<seg id="1132">We have to ask ourselves incomfortable questions after the role of what, deliberately and unaware the "other" to conceal, as it is my girlfriend, in which we did not make a new future, while he had already bombed countries and "to others" people hit, far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion.</seg>

<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the initiative Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS) is the creation of stories in their original language a possible response to it.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about a different initiative of Steven Bird, the Untranslated blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not written on the written word, but on the spoken word. it is a try to obtain the spraying diversity of great cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas like in Melbourne and Darwin in Australia, or in Oakland in the United States, where TLS has already carried out events since 2015, the risk that small and not very small languages are not given to the newborn children.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the Macher of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the world can be avoided, if we do cities that have diversitÃ¤t - safe rooms, where people must not forget to belong to them.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "during" "" "listen to understand," "" "to understand" "" "these events instead" "" "hear" "" "to estimate, to make it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, history accumulates their history at first in their own language and explain it to English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are no professional history of history, their devotion and their representation is that the audiences can be joined to it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call laughter and emotions out, the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">For example, the following video shows a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language of Dafing. during this round, the history of history of Rassidatou offer also the opportunity to clarify the cultural customs of the narrator.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamusara tells the barrel of the bunnies and the spouse in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After being declared the significance of his fuses, John Nyamusara asked, "How is this to speak to an audience, that doesn't understand your language?" with a wide Grinsen, he shares his feeling of clusivity:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have heard!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">To date, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers hope to extend this. all that are inspired by the project can organize with TLS in touch to organize their own history of history.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the aim of a new investigation into the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amounted to 72 million US dollars, the March 3, 2017, took several religious and civil organisations in a mass demonstration; the march started at the puertoriconic Capitol, the government building, and went up to the Plaza de ColÃ³n in the old town of San Juans.</seg>
<seg id="1156">Called "Frente Ciudadano por la AuditorÃ­a de la Deuda" (civic front for the neurons of debt) and the Ãcomenish Church meeting Puerto Ricos.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocate of the new debts of debts have also submitted a petition to the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">The people of Puerto Ricos is that the politicians, banks and government authorities that are responsible for the debts are responsible for their corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1160">We call for a financial exam and a Steering Committee without personal interests to public debts, with a firm, our working conditions corresponding fees, which is agated in favor of the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1161">We are pressed and suppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people of Puerto Ricos is refusing to pay an debt, which is not their.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>
<seg id="1164">Our pensioners will not be able to relocate pension payments.</seg>
<seg id="1165">We require immediate action.</seg>

<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1169">The economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ros requires a broad restructuring of state infrastructure.</seg>

<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>

<seg id="1187">The book, which was published last year and is freely available here, contains a series of essays that deal with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Basle and its work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book wants to discuss how movements for free knowledge are being built and what are the true cost to which this is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activist, artist, designer, researchers, researchers and authors contributed to the movements of freedom of freedom, have been working on site to view over the fog which gives our newsfeeds and to create something of our various experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers, which has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was deleted from the Adra-prison directory, which he sat on October 3, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then we have no information on its present state or position location.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that would like to release his release and to know him back in his normal life and in freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">To see how Basle has a high price for his participation in a free culture, has many of us begin to thinking about their own destinies, actions and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What have we decided for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What did we use extreme beliefs in this process?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The Webdeveloper of Open Source and Digital activist has been in detention since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Basle was transferred to the Adra prison, a non-military institution which was transferred to an unknown place.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer in Noura Ghazi reported that the "Military Police Bassel had taken on the basis of a" strictly secret "given by the military court from his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that it was contacted on November 12, 2015 by individuals who submitted themselves as Insider of the Assad government and had informed of an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">However, his position and condition remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a decisive role that access the internet and to the knowledge of the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist, and currently transmitted the ladder of New Palmyra, a project which founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of the Bassa cultural prototypes have been foretched as the work which he started with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually construct the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crossing of numerous civilizations and merging Greek-Roman architectural types with hiesful traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Basle could not know that ten years after he started working with this work, the IS would put everything to it, this architecture that does not only embodies the cultural heritage of Sysriens, but the world embodies.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strapping into digital archaeology and the maintenance has created a time capsule which will be for the public as well as scientists and artists in the future of unestimated value.</seg>
<seg id="1211">As a result, Bassel was not able to close this project until now.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband, his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I have spent all my life, a lot of freedom to dream and Bashan taught me to embrace them.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I have overcome when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Basle brought to me English, even when he was already in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read English well, to write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He always has his knowledge of shared with everyone who has asked. he has taught other opponents to read and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Basle has opened the gate to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He has also taught other inventions such as computers utilize computers at least theoretically that they actually held a in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Warten), a proclamation, which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015, when he was in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together in the book for a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She sailed his texts to him when she visited him, and he translated them from the Arab into English.</seg>
<seg id="1224">This book is available free.</seg>
<seg id="1225">Book covers Youssef Abdalki.</seg>
<seg id="1226">The book is dedicated to the public domain.</seg>
<seg id="1227">Here an excerpt from the book of Nora with the title "It is happening":</seg>
<seg id="1228">It is happening at every visit,</seg>
<seg id="1229">That I blush in the world of your enchanting eyes,</seg>
<seg id="1230">That I lose the mind at the moment, in which we embrace us,</seg>
<seg id="1231">That any of the dangers doesn't matter to me,</seg>
<seg id="1232">Each of the fences, chains and guards</seg>
<seg id="1233">I forget the plaque of the prison</seg>
<seg id="1234">And I bow in every detail of your voice and words</seg>
<seg id="1235">Which I bear with passion in my passion,</seg>
<seg id="1236">If your eyes say goodbye</seg>
<seg id="1237">And I will leave another piece of my soul with you...</seg>
<seg id="1238">I quickly return to my loneliness,</seg>
<seg id="1239">To get all the moments,</seg>
<seg id="1240">And to weep for your absence, and to smile.</seg>
<seg id="1241">I bear witness that I will return soon...</seg>
<seg id="1242">On the first anniversary of the detention of Basle wrote Ghazi:</seg>
<seg id="1243">A year forgets, my soul</seg>
<seg id="1244">While while</seg>
<seg id="1245">I am in your cage,</seg>
<seg id="1246">And you are still In the cage of Monster</seg>
<seg id="1247">Bassel's history is not unique in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1248">According to the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian Network for Human Rights), since the beginning of the protests in 2011 (Syrian Network for Human Rights), over 65,000 people have disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who have been arrested or executed under violent application by the regime, tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">According to the international human rights organisation Amnesty International have died at least 17.723 Syrer in prison since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many more people remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1252">The Global Voices Community requests the release of Basle since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1253">Today we repeat our demand in hope that we have to do this for the last time.</seg>
<seg id="1254">Mozambique: due to corruption convicted director following detention office once again in previous post</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mosambians reacted with wrath on a corruption, where a government member returned after half of his sentence to the workplace in the state, on which the corruption was celebrated.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is a Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and detained in 2010 along with four other defendants due to failure of 54 million metical (approximately 800 000 euros) for 22 years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds at the airports of Mozambique, whose Council was CFO between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 because of good guidance and called immediately his reattitude to the company, which happened on April 19.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a position of Attorney General Attorney of the Republic, which evaluates the application, there wouldn't be no obstacle for Cambaza, to return to his old position as the company had no discipline.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants are not so good.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public Integration (Centro de Integridade PÃºblica, shortly CIP), a local institution that sets itself for public transparency, condemned the company to reject the director in an interview with the Deutsche Welle:</seg>
<seg id="1262">Represents a setback in the fight against corruption and clarifies the absence of transparency and is even a step towards the efforts of our legal system, so the CIP.</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we need to know is that the company would have to introduce a discipline infringement proceedings against the assignment.</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the company kept silent and concealing no adequate legal steps for applying the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">EgÃ­dio Vaz, a significant voice in the Mosambique social media, rejects this behavior as well as "contracted":</seg>
<seg id="1266">When Cambaza was a competent type, he would have been adviser after being sentenced to prison and to eat half of them.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could pay lectures and motivating words, he could advise and polishing his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he inhibited to be integrated into the company which he saved damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Resistible!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mosambians and student of political science in Brazil says the director no morals:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza was rewarded by the state because he has insulted him, I can't believe someone in such a way that the state has already offended this state.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza is missing the Moral to return and serve the state, * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but has only served in the state instead.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza was used to state the state as a hand-free money supply and the state itself is tired of being tired who was unloaded and killed in a long prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey ZeÃºte preferred it to remember the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel to remind you that a thief was in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to the prison Samora Machel only as the first independent president in memory, but also as a sharp, single-cutting and - Incidentally, prophetric Redner.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous oral representations was, when he confirmed that "an ambitious man is, even the paternland for its ambitions, its own individual interest."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora also said: "I don't know if an ambitious man changes, my experience shows that it is not so. he changes the tactic, but he doesn't turn off his ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">An ambitious man is criminal. "</seg>
<seg id="1281">The reactions were also cancelled in Twitter:</seg>
<seg id="1282">Cambaza was sentenced to 22 years in prison, and he sat in prison for 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="1283">And today the company places the company where he was arising from the contract, again under contract. # AssimVaiOMeuPais - Somiously ignored (@ aze_ Rafik) May 12, 2017</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook has blocked the racist word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censored for many users</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Burmese word "Kalar pae" signifies Kichererbse or spies.</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their Posts from the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although more about the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to assign to people on East indian origin or generally rather than adjectively. "</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facifying the word "Kalar" or (in Augsburg Scripture) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of the hate language in Burma in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">Over the last years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given an extremely sewerage to the word.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that mostly used by Ultra nationalists as a hate speech against Muslims who is a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in the effort to tackle speech in Myanmar, the company has licensed a quantity of sensible content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'today may normally be associated with racism, but the word on itself is not calling to hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that Posts, in which they have discussed the use of the word or doubts for purposes of his use, censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition there are several Burmese words with basic varieties that have the same accounting sequence as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, it is written on Burmese even 'Kalar htaing' which contains the same letters, as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (splinage), 'Kalar oat' (Kamel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooky Aung Kaung Myat explained the various meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of any of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends on the spiritual kind, whether they would like to alleviate his back pain as he made a word.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The sentence KU la - "Healing" (KU) + the Frageword (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were various reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Hoses is the opinion that they must decrease assets of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be analytic before it wants to distribute Facebook in the suspected hour of racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It shook the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automation is not understood what you are writing on factook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What should make it instead, is carefully to analyze the post and check it by checking the words mentioned in the next words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">"" "for example" "" "Kalar Htine" "" "(chair) and" "" Kalar pae "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good is that this three-party nationalists who disseminate hate language, have been preserved a quite good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it's time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action is able to send a strong signal to everyone who disseminate hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experience of social networks in China like Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of whips often have a kiss and mouse game, whereby the user's social networks are simply start to use a new word or an alternative written word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to delete his post when he wanted to tell his friends, that the word 'Kalar' is banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I was attentive to this new directive of Facebook, I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is blocked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically my post was removed from Facebook and I was asked to tell me the post and parts of content for 24 hours because the post "Facebook community standards not deferred."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a variety of posters that have no negative intentions or that simply try to show their opinions on the role of a radical nationalist.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post has been removed, who has nothing to do with Hasselt:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech by Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post he shared his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious foundations are bad in the land.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan myae Khine believes that Facebook would have more to do more than the Burmese Internet Community in front of the beginning of the initiative:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook likes a good intention to reduce racism in Burma by their platform, but it doesn't work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Such words to be censored shall only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">It seems that if they have started this without local context or technical support, and so words like "chair" or "pesencurry" have prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they had made mistakes, they tried not to amend the deleted postal address.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had just a little more respect for the 15 million benefit who had a great turnover, it would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship has donated for a lot of bulky amongst the users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking seriously, users are funny now on Facebook and write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if your postcards are taken from the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook Posts, who had no hate language, but still removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">With permission used.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "the Burmese text reads" "" "I want to sit on a throne and watch a peopcurry and a Indian movie." ""</seg>
<seg id="1332">Just to try out whether Facebook contains the post which contains the word Kalar. "</seg>

<seg id="1336">Over the past five years, extreme nationalistic ideologies and religious foundations, social networks have used to extend their voices and their influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, the language of social networks in the municipalities in Myanmar is said to be in charge in Myanmar, especially in the Rakhine region, where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists have been forced to escape.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been criticized for his convictions, criticizing hostilities in his Burmese pages under control.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But rather than just to analyze the word 'Kalar', it would have better been running to context than on code concentrating initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1343">The children's face is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1344">On 9 June 2017, Parliament of the country unanimously decided to offer a law, which should offer this practice, so that the age-ready age is now at 18.</seg>
<seg id="1345">In front of this change of marriage, some members continued duistic and muscular religion. at that time, brother Harrypersad Maharaj, a group called the representative of the various religious groups of the country, that the state should not be mixed as the State did not ask for maturity. "</seg>
<seg id="1346">This happened, regardless of the fact that Trinidad and Tobago has defined a contractual partner of the United Nations Convention on Human Rights, the minors, under 18 years of age. "</seg>
<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the share of the children who were married to 15 were married, in Trinidad and Tobago 2.8 percent, and at 18 there were 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the Federal Central Office of the country, that of 1997-2007, more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online-petitions and social media movements, which were forced to abolish laws to the children's face, followed by the foot and enjoyed great support. undoubtedly, they helped them to bring this result.</seg>

<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition made for stresses in this actually uncomplicated cause, and some doubts came to whether the opposition would agree to the bill.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017, the bill was decided against the children of children - in spite of 4 Senators (one woman) of the opposition and an independent that abstained - so that he could discuss in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would do it to the law.</seg>

<seg id="1355">One of the country's Senators gave a status update which read Leslie-Ann Boiselle to Instagram again:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: bill of bill against the children of Child was decided at the House of Representatives with 35 votes in favour and not only one single counts.</seg>
<seg id="1357">After having been decided in the Senate in the Senate, the draft may now be appointed to the law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of the social media user was thrilled because the laws of the children of children were finally changed.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook, member Lovell Francis, who dressed in the Ministry of Education in the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>

<seg id="1375">Yet a possible hook occurs in the form of Sat Maharaj, the Secretary General of the Sanatan, Dharma Maha Sabha, the most famous Hindu organization of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Prior to months, Maharaj announced his intention to company judicial steps, should then be adopted the law, and it seems to be able to redeem his promise.</seg>
<seg id="1377">During the Attorney General Paris Al-wi, a author of the law meant, it was quite rightly justified when Maharaj would like to proceed against the law, most of the social media users would wish to do the debate on the subject differently.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell suggested:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, when we say, instead of the discussion so commonly, in a way we would like to talk about the problem that we would say that they might need to worry about the state that they might need of large, persistent men who need to be misused, "would you be ready to carry out the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you believe that there is no problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">However, whether it comes to an accusation against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where the children's before in different gradations are legally or to the norm though there are laws, which they say.</seg>

<seg id="1391">The English-speaking Wikipedia page was presented on January 18, 2012, as opposed to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA. copyright in the United States, internationally darkened.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">Since more than one month, Turkey unlock the popular and at the crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day of day it is clear how important the platform for users can be helpful as well as reliable information and share reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students as well as reporter and fans of TV series against the plywood.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many techniques were used to use conversion tools for block pages (a current article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world), most unusual Wikipedia users will not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been subject to Wikipedia articles from Wikipedia, as recently published in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University has been posted regular blockings of the Internet since 2007 after the Internet Act (No. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">After China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform continued to remain closed, there are several Mirrorsites (pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and often updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform put all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (so calculator machines) based on the system of domain and thus making a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is available in spite of legal prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog report IPFS on his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we have heard the news (over the blocking of Wikipedia), we put everything to put snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. so the option is to read the contents on decentralized and distributed manner.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content, even if they cannot reach the www.wikidia.org website.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also announced that this step is independent of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it only deals with screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Vikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consoli from Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, a Mirror from Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open-source project that everyone can use to make similar Mirror pages when exposed to the respective country where Wikipedia is closed.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consoli reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices as well as collaborator with Mozilla in the Panigrahi's Open Medal "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a Mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You take it to another URL which is not the original. that what you see then is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially the server directs the request to the right Wikipedia page so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia themselves if they are blocked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">For this is executed by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1470">A revised version was re-published here as part of an Content Sharing Convention.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India there are women with the greatest care, the names of their husbands, or even from older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use a ponomen or tell "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">Of Chisisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh give women to respect her husband's social pressure, as well as the fear of the consequences they should misuse the norm to do this practice in life.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was condemned to the Indian state of Oila by a homosexual acts and was cast away by her family and the village community after having addressed a secret relations with names.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Tradition of their wives is not to be called by the name, but also among men are widespread. however, they have far less assignment assignments if at all, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, among them health professionals and housewives, were therefore fast to the main round of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place just for them alone, in which they discuss the hostility of the Patriarchate and discuss.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs, which there are in 13 Indian states, it is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the community video Volunteers and uses himself for dismantling the patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pawas working for seven years with the help of their video camera at the discovery of practices, like children's heaters up to the Verbal of HIV- and AIDS players, and heads these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It is reported how these clubs have created a secure place for those women and made them at the same time to ambassador of the wall.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video, showing the Rohini in her discussion group, did not win their husbands at the name of their names.</seg>
<seg id="1482">It has decided for this issue because they wanted to open a talk about the Patriarchate with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Nor to arrange the names of their husbands according to their husbands, a custom, whom they have found out all the obligations and have never been questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini believes:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman wishes to her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not keep this will be regarded as a hinder than woman without morals.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we never made our discussion round about this discussion group.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning of the Rohini, who had never mentioned their husband so far at home, try to try out at home as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother in law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini told:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband weigh still long after the video was ended.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"" "" "" "Prakash, my husband, turned to me, saying," "" "I should call him at his name." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1493">Rohini started its first discussion club with this self-confidence in Baggage.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" never before. some believed that there was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family would be protected against girls and women.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, women tried to bring the discussion with a exercise in gear.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, leased, sad, lovingly and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">"" "then they asked them all," "" "If we cannot tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us how they want us to respect us?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equal? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years, and this was the first day to whom they brought the name of their husbands on her lips," says Rohini Pajon from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra over the Brechen of a centuries-old tradition, in which he married women to speak the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini told:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that they only went away during the whole exercise; another decided to leave the whole frustrate frustration against him and his family until they cursed him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Expression on their faces was ekstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Even at the Adrenalinrush, with an ancient fires, the women decided that they would actually try to name her husbands in the name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next days, Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas they put in the head: his wife could not cease to say his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another one member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law she joined her, she was afraid, saying that it was an error.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said, "Rohini said that I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was fully understandable and the situation created in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reported how women tried to stop other practices, such as the carrying of the zinnoberred point at the forehead, which shows the status status:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why only women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband, that I would carry the petrol point if it is open.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only, and I heard him to bear it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not ceased to be stopped, but my, they are now in a better position, even to wear it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their views and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we make a trip at every discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we packed lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">I don't want to make sure that the women could hear what could hear, "says it.</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months they celebrated their own birthdays for the first time in her life with cake; they danced and talked about things about which they had never done before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on this problems for many years and yet have I been working about some things, for example how our identities are linked to our husbands, never been so honest.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to say some things according to words, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round we have talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have registered only Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most it is okay, but some wanted a Salman-cta, a large shirt above a trousers, wear it, they have not kept.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much disputes and discussion about the advantages of your own clothes selection, the morals associated with the Saris and much more, clever Rohini made their own pair of curtas (upper shirt) into a discussion round, so that women could wear it.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they have now decided to plan a trip to Goa in which they can wear Jeans and Rohini is sure they can do it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question, if in the five months have already changed anything since their first discussion club, Rohini confirms that the things come slowly into rolling.</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have made only small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tasted a few times, but we stopped doing it again to say the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, make it still, but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two say the names of their husbands; only one or two women now carry Zinnoberrot on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion group know that changes that they would like to achieve in their lives - like the feiling of movement or your own clothes choice - at the end of a difficult to navigate the river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">Being able to trust in each other, they will be aware that they sit in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explained:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a sacrifice of patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am there too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that there is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction, if every woman is in the club home and other people tell us what we speak and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or a country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may be stupid when Singapore is an international level as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice, K. Shanmugam should be considered a town in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the International branch of the State of New York, the Minister, that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because it was compared to Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">It support that Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... nobody said in question if New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">That's it, with most people commit an error.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the Blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice" "" "to turn the logic" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and assessments to create this valuable country, we will say that we will not be any country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It was so vulgar, so vulgar, it had respect to the run of a run before the responsibilities, a mandatory infringement.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore if you are not my country, whose land is it?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons described by Shanmugam were not very Nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of its, he appeared insoftened.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In contrast, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to the cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, as well as cities that are permanently led by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">As soon as you reach the core point of the subject, the good old Leier from the authoritarian feeders could be left to the democrab logic, since it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the final of the last week of Shanmugam gave answers to his American guests regarding our press, our Judicative, our political system truly non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">Appropriate questions tarts with non-answers rational type.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls for Shanmugam to clear his opinion, as they did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country but a city is, so the country belongs to our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">Short, I understand nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be thankful if our dear K Shanmugam would take up the effort to clarify this point if he was paid highly paid to be part of the government of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By clicking on the blog he published his comment on the reviews that you should start to read the entire transcript of the conference, so that you can understand the context of statements from Shanmugam better, according to which Singapore is a city and no country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the heading.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore is rather a" "" "city" "" "as a country," "" "he said why the elections in Singapore would be so important even if we are looking for free and just place elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He earned Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party gain a party?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said," "" "This is not a country," "" "he didn't do it in this sense!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan demonstrates its disappointment over Shanmugam, which makes the leader of a heron-growing generation, a polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am about what said the Minister of Justice of Singapore,...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old yarn that expected me - be understood with them or not, but this is another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of the political leader of Singapore, I doubts and I'm not even sure if he really believes, properly and aware of what he defends.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review the weaknesses of Shanmugam Argumni:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Did Mr. Shanmugam "benevolent a mistake" or was it a freighteous spokesman?</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we will only be considered independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, on which country go back to the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it's equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the government square, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam plays the serious significance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the people afford their military service, defend their country only their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay our Prime Minister invoices?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink headcount?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">Commits the magazine Journey of a Decade to the Beast, Singapore is always a city:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"I did not say what I said..."</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have much more sightings of Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one has ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We were always a city / island nation.</seg>
<seg id="1734">I can understand that we often hear statements as "the defense of the country in particular" etc., but this is not quite true.</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should rather speak of the defense of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1746">For anyone who doesn't know, there is little, that differs us from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians put a Canadian flag in their backpack when they travel.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America, some places will be known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, he is located on the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is managed by a 59- year old Mexican player, a small woman with a coral-pink Brillenframe and golden earrings in teddy shape.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless they know many of the names of Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a goal for Africans and Haitians who are on the passage.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel does not have any charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For approximately 2,50 dollars the night sleep in simple rooms, with grinding, crumbled walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign to the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and African migrants are here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, wife RamÃ­rez tells the people in full small busbuses and the upper part of the coast they begin to call: "Mama Africa!"</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it's rather quiet but in this year, RamÃ­rez has already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have already slept outside on boxes.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She would not want to be ashamed.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and bring them to the hospital when they are sick, they buy them medicines that they do not pay them, it massaged them with a balm that exhausted from a long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived at a short time.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa is a reasonable name for Mrs. RamÃ­rez.</seg>

<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels to Boston with his sister, who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans, who are on the way to the United States, normally a first stop in South America and then move towards the north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard from other Wegers from Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the route," explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that Haitians and Afrikaner often travel the route and that Africans are already talking on Whatsapp by Ms. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">How many of his Wegener did Michelet lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a builders on the building sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy weakens, he started his journey into the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest of Mama Africa since months: it sells SIM cards to save the required money to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he is in the future with Mrs. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"" "" "" "Mama Africa is our mother and we never let them go again," "" "he answered smiling." "" "we will always stay in touch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. RamÃ­rez tells that their guests often send text messages when they have gone to kiss them or tell you about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They declared that their Christian faith is the drive of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but their guests have taught you to prepare hens like in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. RamÃ­rez is perhaps familiar here, but it is not the only wireless hope for migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a cul-lane leads to JesÃºs Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter is Valenzuela and his family moved to their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is policeman and found that the bus stop to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He began to help them to get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for one dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on the ground, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cookery outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests do.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I have lived in the United States," he tells us. "I have experienced what they experience.</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and help others. that's the reason why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After he lived for three years, he was transferred to the United States after a raid on his office.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travels across Tapachula is from Central America, other residents open the doors of their houses for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">JosÃ© Antonio Cordova MelÃ©ndez tells me that he was fled to Honduras with his wife and three children from before men who wanted to make money without a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula, he asked an accommodation and an unknown, a allapason, has offered him a roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later, the family lives and tries to decide where the next steps should go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back to the house of Mama Africa, everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the streets consulted the travelers quiet of their telephones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus arrived today and has 20 new guests, most of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Ms. RamÃ­rez seems happy about that her house is full, but it is also nostalgic, because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">As a proud grandmother hide her in her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There are one of her daughter with African hair braids that you have made a customer, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sad, while she is briefly presented to me.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Habla se fueron," repeats her once every time. "you have already gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang inhabitants are forced to install a surveillance app based on their mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="1960">There is a check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang from Twitter users.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The residents of Xinjiang, an ethnic minorities region in the West of China are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the mobile users in the Tianshan district of Urumqi received a mobile phone number in the Tianshan District in which she indicates the district government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or "web cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in this release, the app tells you that the app" "" "must access to terrorist information" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">But that the authorities use the app for more than the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia 10 Kazakh women were arrested in autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture, because they had installed the app, messages with a private Wechat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the communication of the police, the app wants to determine the sources and the distribution paths of the terrorists and would follow together with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, pictures, ebooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwang Website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is the blocking pornographic Websites, online fraud, Troians and Phishing sites to support users how much time they will spend online, and to control the own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app to help the minors for minors to help children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can naturally be used in a varied way.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" state player or even hacker could control the home network of a person to manipulate or from it.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction stands in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While news about digital censorship in China usually lies on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south, the reality is very often dark for those who live in remote ethnic minority regions like Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">To limit the rest and dissatisfaction in the conflict areas, authorities often arrange extreme poverty and surveillance measures as well as routinely via internet deposition.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The Media-Outlet Media Outlet "images from the beginning of China" (which appeared on the link in China, showed photos of a Checkpoint, by the police officers to review the inhabitants optional, whether they have installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">Authorities in Xinjian are sure that people using the official Jingwang App.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are searching for an Checkpoint using a device without these software, they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for the technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They forced the people to use devices that are intended for elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity due to rest technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China again.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"" "" "" "Images from Route China" ("" "the" "" "Requestwang-Product description" "" ") also released a Jingwang product description, from which the software can lift the license reclamation of a Windows operating system, thus receiving unrestricted access to the hard drive of the computer." ""</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installation of jingwang, computers and cell phones are in Xinjiang to electronic handles.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The regulations in Jingwang may possibly minimize a reaction to the statements of the city party, to minimize the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government branches, authorities and associated institutions, including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity office in operation of their computer and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A current report from Freedom House, an US-American Human Rights Organization, also mentioned this new monitoring system:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, the authorities published a decree on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi a decree with the order to all residents and entrepreneurs, to register their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media memory cards" at local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is to identify and destroy any of terrorist videos, but this promotion has violated the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants, and gives them penalties for a whole number of other possible Agreements, including those who refer to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2065">Its command is to rip so much flesh as possible from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2066">He calls the affectionately "confession."</seg>
<seg id="2067">It starts with a plastic pipe that probably originates from the hooks.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Your Henker beat down to your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2069">Give him the pleasure, you can not measure you with him, and you can't keep your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2070">My carpenters did not get enough, why they were disposed of the tube through a cable.</seg>
<seg id="2071">In my first arrest I asked if the investigator had been working earlier times as garbage collector, or whether it belonged to normal working equipment.</seg>
<seg id="2072">They had four cable attached to each other to present themselves from their sight, great invention of a huge cable.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Three of them only changes three of them while I was still in the series.</seg>
<seg id="2074">I had lost all the feeling in my body - and my voice, so I stopped to cry out.</seg>
<seg id="2075">The Henker reperceives the cooling, and found no pleasure in any case, which is why he found the next to an electrically charged rod.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Electricity flowed all the body, enough to feed my whole quarter.</seg>

<seg id="2079">After two terrible hours he decided that he had met his duty to this night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">It must have been at midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">I decided to sleep me again; let's say, that was my only option.</seg>
<seg id="2082">Some hours passed, which came to me as minutes.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The jordan Rapper Emsallam Hdaib speaks about the rights of the LGBTQ + community, free expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">This picture was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib brings the most part of its time inside; sometimes it ends on his canvas, time to his computer, and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">What can be left, however, a cigar between his fingers or his nicotine lips can be discovered.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year in which Israel had forced his occupation of the West Bank and Hdaibs family had forced to flee from their village in Palestine, where she lived as felahyeen (about: farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For now six years Hdaib is a passionate activist, the conservative majority, and its old proven opinions on gender roles, sexuality and free expression of expression by art and Rapid.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music that sets out often with topics such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian poultry. all these themes do not only find in his home town Amman Relevance, but also in cities that range from Damascus until to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">At the age of 25, Hdaib sees itself as someone who has not restricted to his thinking by borders, and he can feel the most devastating of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria, and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even though he did not open it, he overthrew the US foreign policy against the US foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">He considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib doesn't believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones, anything with his identity as "Palestinian poultry," as he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine until now.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think of my own life, stresses Hdaib.</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then he adds: "I think so because I am a man" while he dissolved in water in two cups. it is the holy month Ramadan. in this time it is planned for Muslims, from sunrise to sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">In addition, the Jordanian law states that the public consumption of food is illegal during Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously, Hdaib has a certain weaknesses to break with ancient traditions, on the other hand, a cup of coffee in a sensible Juneag has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically the gap shimmerse coffee and the crampons of the Kent cigarette in the nose in the first line of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the free sky, especially if you throws a look into the neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore it avoids easy to do fundamental things - as to drink in the public during the Ramadan water - to land not in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Interior Ministry of Foreign Affairs has had a appearance of the band Mashrou'Leila, cancelled, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentary committee that support the Islamic State Court - argued that the Bank's sexual orientation is argued that the sexual orientation of homosexual froners Hamed Sinno, contradicated the cultural and traditional norms of the country and contradicts the main reason for the concert table.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The deputies and former spokeswoman of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub spoke in an interview with CNN that the concert had been cancelled due to sexual orientation of the singers.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many claim also, the commitment of the band in matters like the Arab Spring, human rights and free expression of expression in the Arab world may be more dangerous activism that has the most proven legitimacy of the regime in the entire region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila estimates the jordan people as "progressive supporters of human rights" who continue to continue "for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement is probably not easy to use the rhetoric, but actually reflects a clear crystalline reality in Jordan, which clearly represents the appearance in Hdaibs's plant.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016 Hdaib traditional gender snorms came to body by having formed his vision of the fate of Arabic women who have vorehelichen sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of a apparently horred woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those who actually should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In the past few years, the number of "Honmorant" has risen - the unofficial outside in Jordan.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Human Rights Watch according to Human Rights Watch it reached its climax in the year 2016; however, the institutional infrastructure is missing in order to support women who tried the victims of murders or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law to unbreakage from 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence, "on uncertain time in prison," and for their release is often a longebureaucratic effort as well as the guarantee on the family that the woman will not happen.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs Music enjoys great popularity and is well-known for that, not to reverence issues that can be seen in his country as taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib guards that his work is political, however, is that he could not separate his music, which is full of expirations on sexuality, freedom and expression of expression, cannot be separated from politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "" "" "me was purified," "" "says he." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed" taking Hdaib the question of the Palestinian identity in the attack.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb," the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of the songs which are politically political, can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib published a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song, verse is often repeating:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and every other is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the course of the songs, Hdaib describes the world as a sort of market, on which one can get in his words, "what you want" - unless it is faith or non-faith, heterogeneor homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that hardly anyone speaks in Jordan on the rights of gay and lesbians, and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals were gradually censored in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib led an interview for the popular jordanic Onlineprogram Roya, to remember that his comments was torn out of context and were censored in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube, it was uploaded without cuts, but was only a revised version," "" "says he." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today Hdaib advertises the Arab LGBTQ + community community and represents the opinion that Intoleranz is disable compared to homosexuals not to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nude, a poets of the eighth century, who still has remained in memory, thanks to its homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks: if Abu Nude, which was later to work on behalf of the Caliph, in the eighth century, more than homosexuality could say, why cannot Jordanian people do it?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so hatchaib, have nothing with mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled, to do.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashan kingdom there is nothing new, that the government disputed attacks on the free expression of opinion, and that progressive voices can be brought to silence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the jordanical news service took several former government representatives and members of the teacher's representative, with the reasons that criticises the problems in social media to be criticized with the deep in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of what is the show of Hdaibs, only the top of the ice-ice - the real challenge is to act a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanian.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, progress is a continual Enter and. Jordan, Mashrou'Leila now has a gig in a row, but the way of progress - looks like Hdaib - consists of slow, require and inhumane changes. he is sure that this changes from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Finally, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, were from an Arab world without interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He dreamed, not only to bring his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to experience them. "</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will be annulged with the help of music, art and literature of a real and fundamental revelihood - and not through bombs, spreading, and on artificial art. at least, he hopes it.</seg>
<seg id="2147">If it happen, Hdaib becomes further raging and therefore also resistance to resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was made by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting in which Aman belongs to the Fellow as a student Fellow.</seg>

<seg id="2150">This great, extravagant wardolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta Festivals.</seg>
<seg id="2152">It is believed that there is a variation of the Tanabata festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory indicates that the landlords, the drums and the dance over over one thousand years have been delivered, in order to reach the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi, into the knees.</seg>

<seg id="2157">I have long been watching the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two fixed cars are straight ahead.</seg>

<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the revised version of the contribution "Liebeskind to Guerillakov," which has published the International Online Magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write love letters to people who we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not yet more important, people who can feel outfit, affection to and affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This question went to the two young Colombian activists from the Foundation Bogotart and Cristian Palacios from the Young Youth Foundation. inspired them to send them to the campaign cartas por la ReconciliaciÃ³n (letters to reconciliation), the young people exhorted to write guerrilla letters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently, their country was the scene of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to their part: after many long negotiations, the Colombian Government concluded a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary forces Kolumbiens), which forms the point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">International was the signing of the peace agreement as so important that the Colombian president JosÃ© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for its merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, in front of the column, however, it is still a long way until you can talk about a real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla, who lived for many years in illegal camps, were exposed to a war rhetoric and carried out around the clock their weapons in their lives again, in order to integrate them into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian company again, who had used to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred opposite guerrilla had to take this one in their ranks, and they will support the construction of a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombian had to join themselves and help the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And this is exactly what they did: until now, thousands of young people wrote letters - love messages to former guerrillas to welcome them again in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The goal of the campaign will be 6900 letters - one for every former guerracdampers - who is then to surrender personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The Valentine's Day for the Campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the reconciliation went to the world summit of the Nobel Peace Laureate, which took place in BogotÃ¡ in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk shortly with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This declared that we love the people who love to write on Valentine's Day of love letters, but those who need to need to need much more necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He was, telling his love in this year to share his love with people who needed the most urgent matters.</seg>
<seg id="2198">So the plan to write "letters full of hope and support for former combatants of the FARC." the letters will show that the Colombian company is ready to make the discourse of a war history to a common history of peace. "they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Up to date, more than 2000 letters were collected within the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡.</seg>
<seg id="2201">"I never thought that someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to the Caldono Cauca region on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the Caldono area.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city council of Cali and Leonardo from the Foundation Bogotkind reists into the camp to express the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC was so on how they had previously done earlier to meet the commands of their governance.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they did not receive any orders, but letters full of people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for all parties. "it is incredible how many different feelings one can walk in just a few hours - from fear to luck and everything that lies between," related the political science student Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the governor of the Province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After having passed the letters, a former fighter led me through the camp of guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I in one of the "Cambook" (a kind of hut, in which the guerrilla Live) saw, I saw a guerrilla who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to enter, because apart from him on the bed a MGL-pomegranate, a deadly weapon in the village of a grave.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "I said to him," "" "hello, what are they doing?" "" "he answered:" "" "I am answering a letter that someone has written to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful roll.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never in my life, someone else has written me something like this, and answer me. "they ran into tears over the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I embraced him, and put me in addition to the pomegranate.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was sorry for the war, I was sorry for all the years of faithful companions to be this killing, and would help him to write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never had something else from life as war. the FARC was the only possibility to preserve him and his six brothers in front of the Hungertod. "I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society outside, waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Now I have learned only how I have to handle weapons with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now where peace rules, I can learn many things and work in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">At the beginning, students and leaders of the FARC came to a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC was already in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore, the leader of the FARC bands the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views over the peace process: "for many years, we have experienced the social unrighteousness on the entire Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can contribute to the society in this land.</seg>
<seg id="2224">For one goal of these magnitude, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles, "said one of them.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">These people had never been hearing, who had never found any hearing, and to recognize that people who have seen often as monster and even hated even people with beautiful feelings, which were turned over by their limbs and their environment was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality, in which the country lives, does hurt me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comfort me that all men - even those who have killed, and so much damage caused us to bring us something that can give us a smile, and a smile, and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former combatants have answered on the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote an example of DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monsalvo, Archbishop of the City of Cali, the following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The column was prophesied that after the drainage peace would have rule in peace.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to take up to the weapons of weapons and justifies for their rights. and that is totally justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We use the FARC now to make peace on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">For this reason, we call all defense of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong to themselves - over all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, afford our contribution and sacrifice, because we know from my own experience that nothing is easy. those among us who defend life as the basis of existence, many difficulties will be impending.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2278">I spent more than one month in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">I got a threats last February.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, they wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbours and some away relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The requested me to send me to Chechnya, to prove that everything was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They asked absurd claims: some told me that I had to prove it without through the streets; others, that I didn't change my sex at the official TV in Grozny, saying that I was not bad my sex, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what would I have to say in television?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still difficult for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people said once my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">They said to her, "They have brought a monster to the world, but not only your family, but the entire republic is disappointed.</seg>
<seg id="2290">We can not touch you because you are a pious woman, but you have to disappear from here. "</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and she lay a knck around the neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately, the neighbours and they saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and already a few hours later, under the window a car with darkened windows and a number plate with a 95 rate.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After the third time it happened, it was clear that something is lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights of human rights tested the numbering signs - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how are you fled?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For safety reasons I don't want to give her name, but I will say that I remember them all, they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With her help I left the country, but then something uncredible.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still realize how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without registration, without getting off, without everything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Came and checked in the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">In the moment when I wanted to call my mother by Whatsapp, I got a message: "you believe not what you have left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people know, in which hotel you plug. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove it: it is number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: do you still stand in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we don't speak about gender equality, but this is a tobacco topic.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still bear some traditional Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">So I wish I wish to overcome this seelic barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to violate them.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chill with the camera, I give to me trying to see how the person wants to see them out of their past - so reminiscent of my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But this is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current position in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What are your friends, those who have stayed?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For this I needed more information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I spoke with somebody who saved one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that during Ramadan no people were arrested and tortured, but also that all the Ramadan had hardly waiting to wait, and he didn't lock a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they are now focusing on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">So, I, they probably invite their relatives to worry about the problem with the person concerned and at the end, proof of evidence that the so-called "honor" has experienced by blood.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are now even pregnant women in these secrets?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of Me, it's not very many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then, above all those who have no temporary relatives or have dropped from their relatives to ask the Kadyrow court.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are imprisoned there, so that they can present them later than terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Say: should they be destroyed, they will show their bodies in television and claim to attack any village or a military base.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">However, these men were not simply disappeared, but targeted to radialize them.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this now only a mutation or have you a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just shear someone who was imprisoned in Argun in a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people had disappeared in this prison after having grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There have been nothing new from them.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them away.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was taken away when these people were taken away.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now they were not presented as bandits, but there was no reports so far. we accept that such actions are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would you not allowed this man to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnapping of people who belong to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation already in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I registered my hair for ever.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had one Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think, already before 2003 I was already known in Grozny, when I lived there - and I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when the Sharia applied, I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, there was a lot more secure than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">In Russia, Russia wanted to bring us to the civil war, but ultimately cast us back into the Stone Age.</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is it possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were exhausted; I had colored eyelashes, with tube jeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The safety Ministry of Sharia has never too hattered to me only one hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Before the Russian Theatre in Grozny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people like me arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks were standing, and the whole city knew it. they knew why men, young people met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a hiring: lad lad Kharda. that is, "Spoons not talk about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to children when they are funny about sick people.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so you simply shut up their eyes before you because they believed you are ill?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never offended me, never chased and never struck.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long has this grace time seen?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: as long as Kadyrow joined the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed prime minister in 2005, he began to talk about Moral in television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He spoke not over us, but advanced over the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - I could feel the people in the city began to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">He who was first arrested and was wondering at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But each time I came back home, I was able to feel the situation in the republic steadily.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I do not earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I was still active as a activists.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicating with them as a sort of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We perfectly organize Teetreffs, gathering together, I kept them to the hospital and help them to get food types.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I did not attain a cent.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people even when I cut off-stocked sorrowed.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslima and want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's allied.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So the nature, that has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">That's exactly the same as Chechens who wants to prophesy with foam before your mouth, there is no oscillating with them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Those who have the Cabardiner who also have Russians also who have Russians also; on the whole planet it is - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, that's why it is unpleasant to hear what to hear.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fasten during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">Know, many think of transidentity of men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but this is a truer.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different types of sensation to be exact, different living settings.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me, it is the most important, to feel me in my own skin, and not ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry I'm so personally personally, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all - I just know that I'm now myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warns in front of an increase of self-moral those within the dehumed Arab Ahwazi community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty within the local Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Since the last months there has been a strong increase of self-morsel.</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photo of Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz.</seg>

<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi, on August 27, moved the situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, which is dominated by poverty and unemployment.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the Ahwaz region in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered under anxiety, depression, and he shamed for his own helpless to escape the inability for his family, so Ahraazi Human Rights groups who are working in Ahwaz and anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">On YouTube video, the moments spent the moments after he had ignited itself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people managed it quickly to delete the flames, and Moramazi was brought to the valley station in the town of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, burns was so strong that doctors could do nothing more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide in August which has happened in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activists in front of the spot that even more men may take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Ahmadazi Centre for Human Rights told that this month some other - Hamid Manifesto, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - hanged.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have a thing in common: there were all family doers who decided to feed their families because of persecution on the Iranian government, helpless and indispensable to feed their families and to ensure safe work.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahmadazi suffer from poverty, unemployment, and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, which is located in the most part of the Arab Ahwazi community, was shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult to contest its native Arab population to contest their livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2412">One century ago, the Arab Ahwaz had an predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi Monarchy took power in 1925 to end great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz Region, there are some of the largest in Iran's coming oil and gas fields as well as some of the most common and valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continue to continue slowly, and the indigenous population receives only little of this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often victims of untreated diseases, hunger and emptances.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime refuses the Ahmadazi-Arabs systematically jobs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also built a multitude of dams, the waters of Arab regions in the Persian areas, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are moved.</seg>
<seg id="2418">This dams have only led to destroy them in the region by dryness, devastation and local agriculture as well as the fish and palms industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawzi-adolescents now rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian Director for cooperating, work, and social welfare, told that 5% of the ancestors of Ahmadazis, who finished elementary school, completed 55% a secondary school, and 45% have a university degree.</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahwazi Human Rights activist with residence in London, said Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racist origin," a high increase in the number of self-moral among the young Ahwazi-men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Dohimi said that particularly the unemployment has got worse. the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians and anti-Arab discrimination in the setting process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since Functional and institutions prefers to set up Arab labour force, the local Arab Awazi will deprived access to work opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance of young Arabians and to force them, to earn their livelihood outside their home ancestor.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to hide their benefits and surnames to hide their affiliation to Ahmadazi and thus anodized, since the Arab name cannot be tolerated in the workplace, because the speaking of Arabic language or carrying out of Arabic clothing.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the given circumstances that the Arab Ahwazi have to carry out human rights activists before the situation will become explosive.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why didn't I identifiable with the feminism, also with the intersectionalism</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photos. recorded by: Pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion that was published by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the AfrofÃ©minas website. the article was subject to several discussions where many different positions arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the commentary under the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">If I say that I'm not a feminist, many women - especially white women who describe themselves as an intersectional feminists - with Frust.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They are wondering why I'm not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even have well thought scientific and social arguments from me why I should be feminized and why we should generally all feminists.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, that women still earn less money despite the same formation as men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under stringent observation, if it is doing what they are allowed to do with her body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social standards are still to ensure that women or later stumbles in various areas of life to a glass blanket, and that discrimination based on sex is still passing through the many different countries and faith.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware and known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I'm convinced of this and I suffer double and triple.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, if I have to speak on skin colour, on racism, on black cis women, on black women in the LGBTIQ municipality, or on black women from the Diaspora; if I mention that kind of physical and verbal misses, many white feminists, and white intersecular feminists.</seg>
<seg id="2448">However, they all agree that women - all women - together should be able to sing "their voices, and 'Kumbaya, my lord' to sing, to get the Gender Equality (some) of the women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about that it is in addition to sexualised violence and assistants motivated violence that we are exposed to black women on two times.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or about that black women and women of other ethnicities as white men and women earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">Black girls and girls with migration background of the school are understood as white girls due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spinach and women with migration background are exposed to a higher risk of domestic violence and violence in partnership, as white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the other hand, I want to have all the women, all the men and all human rights. on the other hand, I can not join me as black woman, whose center is the white woman who refused to consider unjust unbelief in their thinking, which relate to both the sex as well as to the skin colour of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight my affiliation in a white feminist orientated sphere that loves me and countless other black women always.</seg>
<seg id="2455">In her words, Soyner complained in 1851 in her words, "Am I not a woman?" and I myself also refused to justify a ideology in which the black woman is a human and marginal beings.</seg>
<seg id="2456">I softened me to join the groupings, which also absorb our customs and customs to drive their egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to draw white women the importance of the overlapping of skin colour and gender. for some of them will continue to keep the importance of black women for feminist movement dead, no matter how many black women try to honor them one better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the intersecular feminism was founded to give women different Herbs a home and became a talk of white feminism, is still the word "Feminism" in his name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I preferred it to resolve me and join the movement of the Womanism, who was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman, instead of myself for a white feminist paradigm that is so persistent that intersectionality is being celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever before we define black women to our own performances and give us into the sphere that we will be created for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism: how we can defend ourselves to create our own kind. and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they can be completely safe in which the cultural, spiritual, seelian, physical and even the spiritual elements can make the black women.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists will be spoken immediately, after they have read these lines, please inquire about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures, because I have existed in this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman as part of this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can flourish in a environment in which my life has not passed, nor ignored, yet will be denied.</seg>

<seg id="2470">In this documentation of Emily Kinskey we follow Musa, who outlines us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the shortened and worked version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay" from Kurds. the article belongs to the series # PorSerMujer (# weilicheinefraud), which report on the wave of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names were changed to protect the people affected.</seg>
<seg id="2482">"" "a police Commissioner said Ada BÃ¡ez, that they had nothing against Luis Balbuena, their own partner who had become violent." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of her relationship a little time has passed and the police said, their statement would be laid to the acts, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">As a further woman Balbuena showed nothing mistreatment, including the acute disappointment of Ada BÃ¡ez.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later the second woman moved back to her ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">To break the Teufelskillis of violence against women, is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women make a display at all, they receive no support on the State.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent on men who admisses them. this explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence at all at all at all in the prosecution's criminal prosecution.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Index1 strokes and Statistical Invisible Misacts and an legal system that does not undertake 3 Paraguay laws: good approach, deficient implementation and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is difficult to determine how many women really harassed, says Myrian GonzÃ¡lez, researcher at Centro de DocumentaciÃ³n y EStudio, a social scientific research institution in Paraguay. "there are different data and reports that, but not even ansatin to show the magnitude of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay," declares them.</seg>
<seg id="2491">However, the figures available are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015 the Attorney General Attorney reached 9600 AD due to domestic violence. 70% of them went to violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of ads come from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 ads due to domestic violence because of domestic violence. 86% of the ads arrived here.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the ads 40% of women who were physically disabled, 55% of women spoke of psychic mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2496">However, this statistics show not the real proportions of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the paraguayan Women's Minister, Ana Baiardi will actually be displayed only few of these criminal offences. "on each woman who are reimbursed in Paraguay for mental mistreation, there are 9 women who do not do this.</seg>
<seg id="2498">On any woman who will be reimbursed for physical abuse, two women who do not do it, "declared at the end of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since women in Paraguay no own offences, the prosecutenforcement agencies cannot represent adequate, such as many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">By August 2016, journalists killed at least 12 cases of women in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates, in Paraguay all ten days a woman died due to violence through men.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible abuse and a legal system that does not decreases</seg>
<seg id="2505">Before Mariana BrÃ­tez was the fixed girlfriend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the name of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">At the beginning she did not want to do it, but then, after. this should always regret it for ever.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no more with Carlos together. for two years she bore the psychic violence against women and at the same time recognizable the most common forms of violence:</seg>

<seg id="2510">I was convinced that I would never happen to happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about mistreatment by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without name, they wrote on Facebook in which they described his popularity and various attacks during their two-year relationship, and told how he had insulated them.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people answered her contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked to rhetorish, whether he ever made the hand against them and refused to agree that his behavior was also a form of mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana, why they had fallen so long ago by Carlos and left him not earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost like that they wanted to say that victims of mistreacts would have at least a certain schooling.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, which is not from Paraguay, fought for eight years with the authorities in Paraguay, to prove that her former partner she mistretreated.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Yo-CREO network ("I believe you"), which consists of women, who are all involved in any manner of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group, they can speak with others about their experience, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias, everything began with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Your well-prosperous partners managed to convince them to convince her that she was valuable.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victorias ads in the authorities remained without result and also from their relatives, they received no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">She led a trial against her former partner, which developed into an unceable legal struggle between Paraguay and its home country, mainly for money, power and influence of former partner.</seg>

<seg id="2534">Echauri argued that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial resources for this:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, mistreatment is seen as part of interhuman relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here, a change must take place, so that violence is not considered to be more than a little bit.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Those who keep silence in the presence of these facts makes himself guilty and contributes to the culmination of the perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2538">We need to allow for a long display until this does not apply more than normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was adopted in the paraguan Senate. previously, parts of the law had been changed, among other things, among other things, among other things, a passage of domestic violence was transferred to reconciliation.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, figure takes place with his consent.</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is only rarely mentioned in the media. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the demand at the site of the medical research there are two reasons: a lack of health benefits and vaccines that cover the special medical needs on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Illnesses such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have reached widespread effects in the poorest countries in Africa, elsewhere, and lack of investments in research of these diseases by pharmaceuticals are a big problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research, which is carried out by African scientists themselves is to develop its own research capacities in Africa. a major role of science and technology can only be eligible for the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is director of the Centre for the research of infectious diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew in the 1990s in Lusaka, Zambia, just as the AIDS epidemic, showed the first graft impact on the national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, he researching the HIV virus at the University of Pennsylvania before he decided to go back home to support the samic health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed about the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstanding of media over these research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(Disclaimer: Dr. Warrier talks as a private teacher).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work on the application of research results. I support the samic national programme for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I got a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">Gv: what are your opinion about the important current scientific topics in your country and in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they distinguish themselves from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only have solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This must change, otherwise we will always stay receivers rather than to be Macher myself.</seg>
<seg id="2605">Solutions that we get, are often not suitable in our environment, and sometimes it is impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">Gv: where does the financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult it is to find appropriate scientist for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are supported differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who come back or come here, because the financing and development chances are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Gv: how is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not correspond to the standards in developed countries. it costs plenty of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">Gv: how is the opinion of the public about Science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there are already interest but only a very limited understanding scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would propose that critical thinking and scientific methods to be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Gv: how large is your opinion, according to the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they focus on, and how can we support development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all age groups.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There are demand for special scientific training, beginning at each age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, Computer Science, Big Data, Exploration of World Health, health (non-transferable and agious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine are highly benefit.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Gv: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as scientists in Africa across Western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often you are limited to do things, things to do and the access to scientific expertise that represent challenges here.</seg>

<seg id="2627">From USA to India: how "open source" seed producers change worldwide food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the Ensia.com website, a magazine published about solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been active in the USA for late 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties, such as outshredder, the first plant, cultivated by NASA astronauts in space and has been consumed.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Mortal's work was placed only by its own ingestion and the question as many salatkinds of salaries can be set.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000, he noticed that more Salads were patented and that he could not use them for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only for single sorts, but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases, a special red or greenish or cheesful leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years, more such patents have been registered for more plants such as cereal or fleet types. due to this trends, plant breeders, environmentalists and expert for food safety ensure the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia old, Morton requires more lettuce, but he doesn't need more, because his work is always worth more limitations.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"it is, when I lie down in a river, a boulders should lie down.</seg>
<seg id="2637">So we have to make it right now, but it's a break with breeding tradition, "says he." I think that these patents will go into salads.</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand before the court, no one cannot represent a new salads, because all features are patented. "he makes so good as possible and tries to recover the features that he would like.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, he is very careful and endeavoured to use no material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">It also has a movement connected to the USA and everywhere in the world: open source Breeding ("Open Source").</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have been bred red RÃ¶mersalat the variety of shredder in the "greenhouse" of the station and it is tested if plants can be cultivated in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather as it would be the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The open source Seed Initiative (initiative for "open-source" seed) can be inspired by the movement for free "open source" software, the alternatives to copyright protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was launched in order to ensure that some plant species and gene are not protected as intellectual property, and can be used for plant breeders permanent.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, for about Ossi, US breeders could undertake that other seeds may use them for them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This does not mean that they do not continue doing business with their seed and sell it. "open source" breeders allow merely others to cross their seed, and not immediately send out - two aspects which are prohibited by many plants or prescribed by many plants.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Scaffectionery prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the emeritus professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi-board Jack Kloppenburg are control of seed and the possibility to breeding new plants and for environmental protection as well as for environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seed is according to him, according to biodiversity, rights of peasants, control over the nutrition system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or just a little bit by using them seed with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasises that the "open source" movement does not work with genetically altered plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, corn, genetically modified or not, from organic agriculture or not. "those who like good, locally and sureproducible vegetables, like it is offered on peasant markets, should also know how it is farmed in peasant markets, as such as this vegetables is bred, is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Nutritional sovereignty without seed sovereign is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative undertake to provide other their seed in order to provide plant, seed and vegetable features.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo of Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters arguing that the food industry is at risk to endangered since the available gene pool due to the always great spiritual property rights on plant material, which is thus always limited, unpaved.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, Executive Director of Ossi, has worked in its thesis with a genetic variation in carrot and their availability. it found out that approximately one-third of all card features are protected as intellectual property, which makes it impossible for plant breeders either at all or less.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants there are such estimates not yet, but experts such as Luby prevented that mass graves are patented such as wheat into even greater style, as a salad or carrot.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A Question of Visiting</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are grown so farmed that they have targeted well-wanted characteristics - from such that their taste or their color has improved to such, due to them in certain environments such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant characteristics prove that the available plant material for breeders through more patents. genetic diversity is currently more needless than ever before, because the changing conditions caused by climate change much worse.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto-spokesperson Carly Scaduto indicate that genetic diversity is generally important and also decisive for monsantos activities. with a total of four Genbanks and cooperation with institutions such as the Agriculture Ministry of the United States, the company has set itself the company for the preservation of genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">However, it contradicure the view that intellectual property is promoting other breeders, as "patents and the protection of plant variances." a patent is basically taken into a plan if the patent expires as soon as the patent expires.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these statements help others to come with another method for the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such protection is not inhibited to innovations, but promotes that the public will provide more material and know-how to be provided. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton looks at least 20 years to wait until a patent expires, and certainly no innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait for long time to keep plants, which have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions, one would have lost the fight.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main argument for Morton requires that genetic resources always have been a general good and continue to remain: "independent plant breeders neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetaires are not attractive for us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make farmers their work.</seg>
<seg id="2671">That's what we use, and it is impossible to use us if we cannot use the best and latest genetic resources. "</seg>
<seg id="2672">In total, Morton does not disturb the concept to be patented. "we are creating the features really itself.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them even as breeder, we finally have no idea how plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A mystery of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, Plant-Seeds in the U.S. state of Oregon and Ossi-board, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "those who are inhibited a variety even though its own values are in them.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believes in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, which are needed to cultivate the cultivation of herbicide, breeding in his varieties of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is accurate. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized enterprises (such that move on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto are) patents, they are able to survive most smaller seed companies - either reject the patenting or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeders Frank Morton requires salads in its breeding garden Salads.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo of Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also the view that breeders could become innovative by the Avoid of plant patents: "it looks like that, when I was with my efforts to produce new things, more strongly than companies that patented.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I need a constantly new material for my catalog, since I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years, "says he." with a patent you are protected for 20 years before competition, where you can easily make it very nice. "</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the United States seem to be a leader in the "Open Source" instruction, the concept has now spread rapidly across all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture") describes itself as professional organization in the field of resources, a "open source" seed program. for the preservation of traditional plant varieties, the centre works with farmers and helps them to breeding new varieties that meet certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports, to come to "open source" seed seeds and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German organization Agreed to an "open-source" licence, which ultimately must be a formal and legally binding form of Ossi-commitment for breeders in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(regulations for breeding are different from country to country, in addition to Ossi's commitment can not simply be taken one in one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission declared that conventionally grown plants should not be patented. thus, they are against the current practice of the European Patent, which allowed patents to conventionally cultivated plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">However, a declaration is not yet a law; now it is in the governments of the Member States to bring this new line to the governments of the Patent Office.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016 the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference to "Open Source" seed systems in Ethiopia, to farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, non-governmental organizations and seed companies from all over East Africa to find something about the "open source" seed movement and the global trend towards achieving seed seeds.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for the "Open Source" program for Hivos' Programme for "Open Source" -seed systems currently declared that the organization is supposed to be a worldwide alliance for "Open Source" seed systems which will be scheduled to fall again next year.</seg>
<seg id="2692">A merger from environmental protection and development groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit development organization USC Canada and the action group to erosion, technology and Concentration) has compiled a database to seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed-good map.</seg>
<seg id="2693">In September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the global Alliance for the future of Essential - a union with aid organisations like the WK Kellogg Foundation, published a report that farmers have to be able to share them and improve the seed policy to ensure a stable supply of food safety.</seg>
<seg id="2694">In the report, the importance of a varied, local supply with seed for sustainable food systems is emphasised - a connection between the Luby of Ossi hopes that soon more people will recognize him.</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological foods has almost identical to where and how little is grown, and seed systems have hardly been played," so Luby. "we try to clear the human being, that even more behind their food."</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the newest goals of the censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities still lock content on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columniest.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of the 5th August the Egyptian government closed the website of the Holy Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents the human rights abuses in Egypt and the Arab world and reports about that.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network published a statement on Facebook, where the Egyptian authorities criticized for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Holy Network for Human Rights Information abiding in spite of this attack and the constitution of Egyptian Law and the Constitution. even if it was never so difficult to follow these goals, it was not so important as now. ANHRI confirms that all technical possibilities shall be exhausted to overcome the blocking and not after. we hope to meet our task.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is regarded as the first zened website of a human rights organisation in Egypt, after the authorities block the independent news page MADA Masr, arabic-speaking Edition of Huffington Post and Qatar in Qatar for alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organisation of wave of wave lines like victims. @ anhri one of the main sources of human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">Apart from ANHRI, there is no access to the blog of the columniest and Human Rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada no access in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the dissemination of column and articles that he is not accessible for living in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog he set up in order to circumvent the Egyptian government, even the goal of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger who is native to the also Ziiada blog is on the other hand, however, is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photo journalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity, after he reported in December 2013 by Egyptian security forces, while he took a video on the student leaders, as the police took physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Its articles are mainly based on politics and human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a facebook comment, Ziada expressed himself to the blocking of the government and reflecting what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The blogs to unlock is very old, but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be meaningful for the world, it is yet for me for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It is necessary to send me the feeling of a siege to me; an arrest, an ensued murder, prescription at the national Security Council, the blocking blogs and any other web site for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I did not wrote in vain. in other words, my words have influence, even though only a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I wish to mention that this blog was a Archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I used it to item of articles to circumvent the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Now, after they have blocked him, and that they may fear words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The mug goes through the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE), Egyptian authorities opened on 24 May to 06 August 133 websites. this gave technical tests to the network of various Internet Service Provider (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">AFTE also documented the remote control of providers in addition to the collection of Internet-sur and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in their research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, 12 June, we realized how the flexing of websites that have been offering the VPNs.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice indicates the intention of the government to block the contents and filters access to the Egyptian user.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation is additionally worsened in addition, that the Egyptian population has no legal basis for the Egyptian population, with the aid of judgment on these actions.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the censorship and who will attack them next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>

<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper on all over the world with a war ruin in a country that didn't recognize the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">The same video explains a journalist that according to the Bank's Internal Security Institute in Rio de Janeiro there are 843 territories that are controlled by criminal organizations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial article the newspaper writes:</seg>
<seg id="2768">It is aware that a war discourse, if it is distorted to be used, abominations of the police, who just shoot first and then ask questions to conceal.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose aim is not the civilian population, but the economic power of mafia and their partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Would the designation "War" more than it used?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil argued the journalism in CecÃ­lia Oliveira, a justification of failed security policy through the media and could make it difficult to reinforce responsibilities in the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is no war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and worse planning - how extra in the analysis of the military interest rates in Rio itself has shown - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel, lightenment and a historical and self-deductible neglected of public service.</seg>

<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Asharaf found himself in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">A few years he worked in a coherrube. the work was heavy and made it ill.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took that which was left out of his low wages, and went into Iran. once again, he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and towing bags with mortars, which were heavier than he himself to make his life.</seg>

<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf left his life without papers in Iran and made himself ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous override on the sea he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum request, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time was Asharaf homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that divided twice on day eating.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy due to relatively high adowing quotas is a sort of second chance for expired asylum seekers. however, it is also true that conditions for asylum seekers in the country are catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="2898">The Human Rights Organization of the Liberties Union for Europe writes, the system suffers "suffer from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">The vast majority of the asylum seekers are housed in more than 3000 "specific reception centres. they are improvised with improvised equipment in the hands of unqualified and unprepared staff."</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to the Italian law, asylum seekers only be assigned to a reception center, if they have officially applied for asylum, after registration of the asylum request for months.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then there are people who have no money for a stay, either to the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So, it came to Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his indigent lifetime helped Asharaf to release himself out of these conditions.</seg>
