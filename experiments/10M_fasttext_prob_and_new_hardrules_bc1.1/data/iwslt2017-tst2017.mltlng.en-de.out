this is James R@@ isen .
they might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as New York Times Rep@@ orter .
for a long time ever before someone heard Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he released the N@@ SA illeg@@ ally detained by Americans .
but it is another chapter which should leave a permanent impression .
it describes a cat@@ astroph@@ ic US secret service operation in which the CIA had literally over@@ threw their designs for a atomic bomb .
if that sounds crazy , you read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who didn &apos;t know the chapter ?
the US government .
for almost 10 years , the government has determined against R@@ isen and called upon him to name its alleged sources .
in this train , he became the symbol of the government of government , W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower to condemn and journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Court , the media has the right to publish a secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if Media does not receive this information , and if they cannot protect the identity of the mu@@ g they will be priced .
so when the government was cr@@ ammed with R@@ isen , he did something that many bra@@ ve rep@@ orter did before him : he refused , and said he would prefer to go into prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen lived with the risk to go into prison .
but then , only days before the trial , something unusual happened .
suddenly , although they were present for many years , the demands of the government were dropped upon rats .
the reason : in time electronic monitoring , Rep@@ orter and sources can still hide less .
instead , instead of failure and cr@@ ises to bring it , they could do his digital foot@@ steps for him .
and so , the investig@@ ator , without his in@@ compreh@@ ension , worry , his phone is secret ,
just like his e @-@ mail data , finance and banana information , its credit card , and even travel information with the list of its flights .
in the midst of this information they found evidence that they took to Jeffrey Sterling , a CIA @-@ W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and cra@@ ck source to condemn .
unfortunately , that is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect his wounds , W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower , but instead , the j@@ udi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned more than all US governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how to be a problem , especially because the government is too much of their work as secret .
since September 11 , almost every article about national security had the result that a W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower came to a journalist .
thus we set up the press work on the game that is protected by the first constitutional rate because the government has always increasing more possibilities to pi@@ on@@ ate all .
but just as the government &apos;s technology allows to handle the rights of rep@@ lication , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and in fact , they may take up from the moment in which they contact , rather than in the night , in the testimony .
today , there are communications software that had not been written when R@@ isen had written a book , and it is much saf@@ er than normal e @-@ mails or telephone calls .
such technology is an Secure@@ Drop , an open source app@@ ending system for W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the Internet &apos;s most famous Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation where I have been working further .
instead of send an e @-@ mail , go to a news website , as the Washington Post works here .
there you can upload documents or send documents , as in each ordinary contact form .
these will then be encrypted and stored on a server , which only has the respective news agency .
so the government cannot aff@@ les more information secretly , and many of the information that would like it would be not available from previous .
Secure@@ Drop , however , is only a small part of the whole to protect the Press Freedom in the 21st century .
unfortunately governments of all over the world develop new sp@@ y technologies , which are all end@@ anger@@ ed .
it is due to us that not only technology en@@ ner like Edward Snow@@ den have a possibility of bringing abuse of abuse . it is so important that we protect the next W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower ,
who wants to know about abuse during the supply of soldiers who wants to report of over@@ crow@@ ning hospitals . or the next environmental workers , the alarm to the se@@ d@@ ated water of Fl@@ int . or a wall @-@ street @-@ Insider , who war@@ ns us before the next financial crisis .
nevertheless , these technologies were not only made for those who want to un@@ cover crimes , but to protect against our constitutional rights .
thanks . thank you .
&#91; 3 April 2016 &#93; The largest data of the story was published . &#93; &#91; the &#93; &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; revealed that &#91; ... &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to have a declaration . &#93; this week we were sent by news about a che@@ que of 11 million documents of local law firm Moz@@ ambi@@ ca
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax bats .
we get an impression of how clients , banks and lawyers to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ se@@ ca go and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you judge that ? &quot;
in fact , we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
Iceland Prime Minister is returned .
also there are reports that a ally @-@ accused of brutal Syrian dict@@ ator B@@ asch@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s p@@ aging companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ases .
it is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars would lead to Russia President Vladimir Putin , on a tight friend from children &apos;s days , a famous C@@ elli@@ sts .
now there will be a lot of rich people and others to wait the nerv@@ ous to the next release , and to the next un@@ veil documents .
now it sounds like the plot of a agencies or a John @-@ Gr@@ ish@@ am novel .
it sh@@ ines from you , me , ordinary people .
why should this be ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and do not all of their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and that concerns us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these re@@ vel@@ ations are phenom@@ enal .
in all over the world , media and leading politicians , such as secret tax ha@@ v@@ ases of some few are used to hide their wealth and to don@@ ate -- some , which we have been discus@@ sing and reveal ourselves since ten years .
I think many people will be very conf@@ using this whole world , and it &apos;s hard to understand how this tax ha@@ v@@ ases work .
I &apos;ll always present me like a Mat@@ ry@@ osh@@ kap@@ u@@ ator .
so one company has a company in another company , in another company which makes it almost impossible to understand , who is behind those of this prayer .
it may be very difficult for prosec@@ utions and tax authorities as well as journalists or civil society really understand what matters .
I think it is interesting that there is less reports about this matter in the USA .
probably because it has so far been no more prominent Americans that came into this sc@@ and@@ al in this sc@@ and@@ al .
now it is not so that there is no other Americans that you hide their fortune in tax ha@@ v@@ ases .
but by the principle , after that these tax ha@@ v@@ ases work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ se@@ ca has less American customers .
if we had a backup of the Cay@@ man Islands , or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming , Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the United States .
indeed , it is so that you need less information in some US states to obtain less information to obtain a company than to obtain a library card .
this type of in@@ transparency in the United States has employees working to school children , school children .
it is allowed to remove particularly vulner@@ able investors .
it is this type of behavior that affects us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to figure out how all this is in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a c@@ apped investigations into the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator gave himself as an African ministers , who wanted to bring suspic@@ ious money to the US to buy a house , a boat to buy a private jet .
we really em@@ ailed us that all the way up to a lawyer &apos;s suggestions , how he might transfer his money .
these were all inci@@ dents . no one of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course no one has been handed over to it . however , it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider this not as individual cases .
it does not work for a single lawyer , who under@@ taking the secret investig@@ ator proposals .
it does not work for a single top pol@@ iti@@ cian , wrapped in a sc@@ and@@ al .
this is how the system works through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and to cope this , we must change the rules .
we must change the rules to make this type of behaviour .
it &apos;s all very angry , as if we could do nothing against it , as if nothing would have changed it , as if it is always the rich and mighty one will give .
but as a refuge , I see that some things have started to change .
in the last few years we have seen occurr@@ ences to more transparency , aff@@ ecting the owners of companies .
the subject was political attention through British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
since then the EU measures at national regi@@ sters at national level , who really is behind companies in Europe , and who controls them .
one of the un@@ pleasant facts is that the United States hin@@ ts back .
the representatives of both parties have entered a bill in both parliamentary chambers , but this makes not the progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how this Panama res@@ ett@@ ings , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ases used as a means to ensure more transparency in the USA and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for changes .
we need ordinary people who want to be angry when other people can hide their real identity behind projectors .
we need managers in economy that rise and say : &quot; in@@ transparent is not good for business . &quot;
we need leading politicians that recognize the problem and to finish this kind of in@@ transparent laws through the laws .
together , we can finally termin@@ ate the in@@ transparent , which is now able to end this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing .
this is the story of what I had been ab@@ duc@@ ted once and in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das would have landed .
one day after I finished my design studies , I made a back@@ day sale .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da remained and looked for my stuff .
he bought one of my art works .
he was only in the city alone and just made a road trip through the whole country . after that he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him on a beer . he told me as he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
while we paid the bill , I made the mist@@ akes to ask him : &quot; where do you feed this day ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did worse the whole thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I thought : &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just learned it . he says he would go to the cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he is really planning . I don &apos;t have ab@@ duc@@ ted in the boot of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small luggage compartment !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard me saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do you like ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the night I was in bed , I star@@ red to the ceiling and I thought : &quot; Oh man ! what have I mounted to me there ?
a wild@@ land sleeps in my living room .
what if he is crazy ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I got up out of the bed , on the ti@@ dy pointed to the door , and my bedroom door closed .
but he was not crazy .
we are still in touch .
the artwork , which he had purchased from me today , depends on his class@@ room . he is now a teacher .
that was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my viewing angle .
perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood than strangers , were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered ?
people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress .
let &apos;s take a leap , two years later ...
I &apos;m unemployed , almost ple@@ ite , my roomm@@ ates and the rent will be increased .
I knew that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I believe , creativity can make it to be afraid of fun .
I wrote my best friend and new roomm@@ ates Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I survived , as we could make something to earn . our apartment is available for a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , with a mattress and a morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a site and established the &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep at the air base for 20 dollars on wooden floor .
they found it super , and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese ham and O@@ mel@@ et tast@@ es completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we caught our last guest and got the door to the castle , rigid Brian and I joined us .
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and could pay our rent ?
the things came into rolling .
my former roomm@@ ates , n@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ c@@ zy@@ k , joined us as developers .
we wanted to figure out if you could make any business concept .
so we presented our investors : &quot; we would like to create a website , on the people public pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the type of rooms whose doors are coming when you pass by .
you can then charge wild people on the Internet , where they can stay overnight .
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we were waiting that the miss@@ ile would have ign@@ ited .
but did not do it .
no one who is still very near of comfort would invest in a business that allows a stranger to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because we have learned children , strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you think all things that you can do well . we have designed designs .
at the Academy of Fine Arts , we had learned that design is much more than just the appearance and h@@ ap@@ tics -- it is the general experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create their trust by design , between humans who had never met before .
can design be like something ?
is it possible to create trust with Design ?
I would like to give you a tasting of what degree trust we ourselves .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort one .
thum@@ bs up , if you are ready .
take your mobile phone in your hand .
now I would like to make you un@@ lock your mobile phone .
enter your un@@ locked mobile phone your left seat .
this silent trace of pan@@ ic , which you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts will feel when they open the door first time .
for the only thing , what is personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to keep the un@@ locked cell of a fore@@ igner in the hands ?
most people feel responsibility .
even the most guests will feel when they stay there .
only for this reason our company can exist .
only times so , who actually has Al Go@@ res Cell now ?
could you explain on Twitter so that he is codes for the Office of the President ?
you can now return the phones now .
they now have experienced what kind of confidence we want to build . I would like to tell you of some discover@@ ies .
what if we have changed a small detail on this experiment ?
what if your neigh@@ bor could have been presented once with his name ; if he would have told , from whence he comes , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine , you would have 150 beats , who say all : &quot; he can really hold very well locked mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel when you should leave your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ filled feedback system strengthens trust .
at the beginning , we have made some things wrong .
it was difficult for people to vote negative evidence .
in the end we decided to wait until both hosts and guest were submitted to ass@@ ess@@ ments before we set them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people may trust one another , depending on how they are similar to age and housing .
little sur@@ pris@@ ingly , we trust the people most , which are most similar to us .
the more differences , we find the less trust .
this is a natural social regulation .
exciting , if you add the call of a person -- in our case by ass@@ ess@@ ments .
if you have less than three ad@@ mitt@@ ments , nothing changes .
but it has more than ten , changing everything .
a good reputation of fame and simil@@ ar@@ ities .
so the right design can help us to overcome some of our deep roots .
we also knew that confidence is dependent on how much you get from itself .
here you can see the reactions to the first news of a guest .
if you &apos;re too little , how for example &quot; Hi ! , &quot; one gets more answer .
tell as much as for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- -- the request is not accepted .
so there is an optimal degree of Open@@ ness , such as &quot; T@@ olle works of art in your apartment ! I &apos;m doing with my family vacation . &quot;
how can we create it with design , restore this degree in Open@@ ness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text . we also give tips on what topics you should write anything .
our whole company reli@@ es on hope that the right design can help to overcome our fore@@ heads compared to strangers .
as we were not expected , the large amount of people who were more than prepared to submit these deposits .
here you see how many people take our special offer .
you can recognize three things .
first : incredible great luck .
second : the un@@ ti@@ reless work of our team .
third : a need that was not covered before .
business is very good for us .
of course there is also times , if not everything goes smooth .
there were guests who have not allowed parties to be celebrated or rented apartments .
hosts will have guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked on the customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front front , when he was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . already wo@@ e when I think it only .
the dis@@ appointment that list@@ ens in the voice of the recru@@ itment , it was also always our greatest motivation to further improve us .
lu@@ ck@@ ily , the 123 million people had only a fra@@ ction with a problem .
for people trusted right to one another .
if confidence works , will be able to emer@@ ge himself .
one of our guests made vacation in Uruguay and he suffered a heart attack there .
his host went to hospital .
he even got blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for trav@@ ellers who tend to heart attack due to seat activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
Javier and Ale@@ j@@ and@@ ra are real Guardian angel who save lives , although they don &apos;t know one at all .
you drive one in your own car in the hospital when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want to feel lon@@ ely , they bring books on it .
you can even stay longer , without charge the extra nights .
I only recommend it ! &quot;
so , of course , does not run any stay .
but these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to reach in the share economy .
when I looked for the first time about this term , I asked myself :
how does the idea of writing with money transactions together ?
it is about a economic business here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it just is just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it is not just the case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people lay a part of itself , and this changes everything .
when you travel today , it is easy to compare with Fast Food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
what if travelling would be a rich buffet from local income ?
what would be , if you &apos;re visiting to wait a group there , a group there would be thoroughly re@@ plen@@ ish and to show one of a c@@ ubs area of which you have never heard ;
or if you cook a five @-@ star cook ?
nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would like to share flats from the ground ?
what would that look like ?
what would be , if cities would have received the idea of a joint share ?
I present the cities that allow us to reach society and relationships , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and fir@@ ing .
in South Korean capital Seoul , this project was begun . many parking spaces , which belonged to the government ,
all residents were offered now . students who were looking for a stay in search of a lead ,
were convey@@ ed in humans whose children were finished . In@@ cub@@ ation programmes were launched ,
to finance new start @-@ ups in the share economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries are participating in a stranger or self @-@ host .
the idea seems to be so crazy about how it was brought to us .
we are not re@@ invented the wheel .
hospitality has already existed before .
there were already similar websites before us .
so why did it just work ?
apart from luck and tim@@ ing we realized that you can find the right design of the confidence of confidence in confidence .
design can help us to overcome deep roots .
I find it bl@@ ossom ,
it was overwhelming .
I have to think about it when a red Maz@@ da has gone to me .
we naturally know that design can not solve any problem .
but if it could help us if it had great influence , I ask myself what we can proceed for soon .
thanks . thank you .
what do you think , if you see me ?
a beli@@ ever ? a expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , a brain under@@ wear , a terrorist act ?
or just a delay in security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the gu@@ ilt for your negative impressions .
so the media is present so look like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of coverage regarding Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : Americans mine , most would not know Muslims .
presumably the people do not speak with their U@@ ber drivers .
for all those who have never met a Muslim : it is great , you know knowledge .
I say to you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee @-@ operated - double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra .
I am noted ,
a se@@ al@@ eg@@ ern fitness fan@@ atics ,
and I am a practic@@ ing , spiritual Muslim min .
but not how Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born so .
I decided to have it .
when I was 17 , I met the decision to ou@@ w me .
no , not as a hom@@ osexual man , like some of my friends , but as the Muslim . I decided to bear Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head covering .
my fem@@ inist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; why do you sing yourself ? &quot;
the L@@ ust@@ rade was : at that time it was a fem@@ inist declaration of independence , as compared to the pressure that I felt as a 17 @-@ year @-@ old , will adapt to a perfect and un@@ achiev@@ able beauty deal .
I have not only adopted passi@@ vely to the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ ling with the Kor@@ an .
I read it , thought , asked in question , doub@@ ted and believed .
my relationship to God was not love at first sight .
she was confidence and long dev@@ otion to deep@@ en the cor@@ ding with each reading of the Quran .
the beauty of rhyth@@ ms bring me sometimes to weeping .
I know it myself . I feel that God knows me .
did you ever feel that someone does not know you understand completely , and yet somehow I love ?
so it feels like that .
later I married and began as all of the good Egyptians , my career as engineers .
I later , after my marriage , a child , and lived basically the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot;
then the terrible morning came in September 2001 .
many of you remember exactly where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked on screen and saw the word &quot; Eil@@ een . &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ crafts caught in buildings , people spread out of the buildings .
what was it ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock related quickly in indig@@ nation .
why should I do so ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I changed the television channel and heard : &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terror@@ ists ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Ji@@ hadi@@ sts ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh , my God .
it is not only my country attacked , but in N@@ u related me the acts of others from one citizen to a susp@@ ects .
the same day we had to go through the Middle East of the USA to go into a new city and start post@@ graduate course .
I remember , as we were silent -- as we were silent -- as low it went to my seat , and I feared the first time as the Muslim .
we moved to this night in our apartment , in a new town , in which it felt like a completely different world .
and when I heard , I looked , and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organizations that said , &quot; Be careful , &quot; and lead me in well @-@ illuminated area , &quot; Con@@ sequences towards you . &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
then it was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gathered to prayer .
and again , the war@@ nings : &quot; not on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
the feelings were in@@ compreh@@ en@@ sible and I heard of attacks on Muslims or of people who stayed for Muslims who were torn in free .
there were really Bran@@ dan@@ ces on Mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something really felt right .
because people who attacked this country have attacked our country .
I got the rage of people to the terror@@ ists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to explain so continuous themselves .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
there are the alleg@@ ations that are hard .
today we can listen to people : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it means Muslims .
when will we go off ? &quot;
some people want to join Muslims and Mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as from a tumor in the US .
it &apos;s just the question : are we bad or gut@@ ted ?
they know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor can be found as a whole and a non @-@ mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor one can only be under observation .
the alternatives are po@@ int@@ less because the question is wrong .
Muslims are like all other Americans , no tum@@ ors in the body of the USA , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , s@@ thel@@ ial and Olympi@@ on@@ ics .
will the closure of the mos@@ ques of America become a saf@@ er ?
there may be a few parking spaces , but not stop the terror .
the regular visit of a mosque leads to people with other faith toler@@ ant , and greater civil participation to show .
and like me , head of the police in the area of Washington , DC recently added : people will actually not be ra@@ zed in Mos@@ ques .
they are ra@@ zed in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
at the time of the radio process it has been found that it will begin online . as the creation , the person will not be taken away from their family , that the person who believes , the terror@@ ists are the true Muslims , and everyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behavior and their ide@@ ology is a betra@@ yers or of the belief .
if we want to avoid radi@@ cal@@ ization , we must stop the people to go to the mosque .
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group of how the IS carries out its breeding with the Kor@@ an .
as a Muslim , as a mother , I think we must do everything to stop a group as the IS .
but we would put forward to their privileg@@ es when they acknow@@ ledge it as a representative of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Kl@@ ux cl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ide@@ ology reasons on their &quot; holy book . &quot;
but if you have a look at her , she does not drives what they do in their &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot;
it is their brood @-@ vit@@ ality , which they may read these things into the scriptures .
an outstanding im@@ am told me a marv@@ ell@@ ous story :
a girl came to him , because they regard it to the IS .
I was surprised and asked him if she was in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said , the problem was exactly the opposite . everyone who had spoken it , brought them to silence , and told her , that their wrath , their sense of un@@ righteousness in the world , would only bring them into difficulty .
nothing inspired and something that have been given to her rage , she was a main goal for the instrum@@ ent@@ alization by extrem@@ ists who spoke to their solution .
this Im@@ am turned the link to God and their church .
rather than accused of having acc@@ use for her gro@@ ove , he demonstrated her constru@@ ctive ways for a real change in the world .
what she met in the mosque , she kept it to join the IS .
that was an insight , like the Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia me and my family .
but how does it work on normal Americans ?
how does it work on any other ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear every day on our democracy ?
a study -- actually several neuro@@ science studies - show : if we fear , pass at least three things .
we accept a author@@ itarian government system , conformity and supplies .
a study shows : if you report reviews in which negative for Muslims , they voted for rather military attacks on Muslim countries and the circumcision of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
if you look at when the mood rose up against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then it happened three times , but never in connection with terror attacks .
it happened in the preparation of the war against Iraq and during two election periods .
so , Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction on Mos@@ lem terror , as I expected it .
it can actually be a tool for manip@@ ulation to be public in order to under@@ mining the foundation of a free society which has been sen@@ sible and well informed citizens .
to deal with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we perhaps feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear constra@@ in@@ eth us all .
in the assignment of collective school@@ d it does not only have to explain himself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple , who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was an athl@@ ete .
he was at the dental Faculty , talented , promising ...
his sister would say to me that he was the sweet , most generous man , whom they knew .
she visited him there and he showed her res@@ ume . she was tru@@ th@@ ed and said :
&quot; when is such a young man di@@ versi@@ fied from my breasts ? &quot;
just a few weeks after visiting Su@@ z@@ anne during her brother and his wife , her neigh@@ bor , Craig Stephen H@@ icks , she was murdered in the afternoon as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an who posted in the afternoon as he posted outside of Muslims on his Facebook page .
he shot eight times on De@@ ah .
Fan@@ at@@ ism can not only be bad , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
are we gone to the mosque , we remained safe at home ?
we had it and for us it was no easy decision to let America we want to leave our children : one that would control us through fear , or one where we can freely prac@@ tise our religion .
we decided to meet for the mosque .
we keep silent with our son in the children &apos;s seat , with high pressure to the mosque .
I took him out , moved out my shoes , went into the building hall , and what I saw , let me hold .
the hall was rest@@ less filled .
then the be@@ am made a announcement , than@@ ked up and welcomed our guests , because half of the were gathered Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hist@@ s , believers and non @-@ believers who were come , not to attack us , but to stand for us .
at this moment I have collap@@ sed .
these people were there , because they had the courage and repro@@ aches of pan@@ ic and pre@@ ference .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose from the moment of anxi@@ ety and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism ?
are you going to go on number ?
or will you join them , my : we are better than they .
thank you so much .
thank you beautiful !
Helen Wal@@ ters : therefore D@@ alia , you seem to have a nerv@@ ous .
but I ask myself , what say that you may say that you &apos;re a T@@ ED@@ Talk , a thinking with a dr@@ au@@ ght that are going to work in a noble monument factory , thus an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , I don &apos;t think . I &apos;m totally normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I &apos;m so usually as it is allowed .
if you look to Muslims in the whole world , and I did that with the greatest ever conducted study to Muslims in the whole world , want people normal things .
they want prosper@@ ity for the family , they want to work and they want to live in peace .
so I have no exception in any respect .
if people appear as a rule , then the rule is broken , and they are not the exception to rule .
HW : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for Bast@@ ers , is short before .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . possible in research institutions worldwide .
before the air act has entered into our social consciousness , a autonomous fleet of aircraft machines at the Fra@@ c Centre in France live a six meter high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago she began to fly with arrows .
by connecting connect , high speed and acceleration in the smallest space .
you can also build self @-@ loaded structures .
they have learned to bear loads , to deal with tur@@ bul@@ ence and to respond to natural laws .
today we would like to show you a few of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of Pos@@ sible flight in an autonomous flight .
with that a system of aut@@ on@@ om works , it must know collective gu@@ ardian , where space is located in the space of the mobile objects .
in our laboratory at ETH Zürich , we often use external cameras to find objects . that allows us to concentrate on rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s , we use a new loc@@ alis@@ ing technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a publisher of our laboratories .
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine position in the room , calculations on board determine what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are available at the highest g@@ e. g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
a flight that tries to strike two flying with a fl@@ ap .
like other starters , it is efficient , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all its variations .
in contrast to most of the starters , it can be h@@ over , and has great benefits at start and landing , and is very versatile .
but there is always a swe@@ at page .
a limitation of rear devices is that they react sensiti@@ vely to tur@@ bul@@ ence such as wind turbines .
we develop new controls and algorith@@ ms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the air@@ unit doesn &apos;t matter how the optimal position can be recovered and the performance through practice can be improved .
okay .
during our research , we often ask for fundamental abstract questions related to the core of the cause .
such a question would be for example : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for this to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known about machines with a thousand moving parts that are met to viol@@ ate you .
two pilots were able to fly remote control units , which had only two mobile parts : one propeller and one stern th@@ ru@@ der .
we discovered that flies with only one works .
this is the Mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechanical and simple remote control unit . it was recently invented .
it only has an event@@ ful part , a propeller ,
no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and trans@@ verse plates , no further actu@@ ator or control surfaces , only one propeller .
although it &apos;s mechanically simple , the inner life happens very much , that it can fly stable and can easily move in space .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear . to bring it to flies , I have to throw it exactly .
the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood to throw exactly correctly , if all is shown , is small , therefore I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening .
when the Mon@@ osp@@ inner is a exercise in Gen@@ ü@@ am@@ ity , this machine is here , the Omni@@ cop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , a exercise in excess .
what to do with all this flow ?
they see that he is symmet@@ rical .
that is why it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
as a result he receives the closest ordinary ability ,
in space to move in all directions , no matter how it is directed , or even as it rot@@ ates .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of eight prop@@ ellers .
a lot is possible in models , the rest is lear@@ ns directly to fly .
let &apos;s see that .
when flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine here consists of two separate two @-@ prop@@ ellers engines .
the rot@@ ates in clock@@ wise
and the other against counter@@ clock@@ wise .
when you assemble them , they are like a high @-@ intensity Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
however , something wrong - a motor or prop@@ ellers falls off , the electronics or a battery -- can also fly further when restricted .
we will therefore demonstrate that we make a half air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration examined synthetic barri@@ ers .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units enables a pallet on aesthetic expression .
we used commerci@@ ally available Micro quad@@ cop@@ ter -- every single weighs less than a disc bread -- and out@@ fit them with local technology and algorith@@ ms .
each unit knows where space is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit .
we hop@@ efully motiv@@ ating this demonstrations to re@@ consider new revolutionary ideas .
the especially secure machine da dr@@ um@@ my would like to become a flying lamp screen on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predi@@ ct the influence of this technology .
for types like us the salary is in development and the work act .
it serves as a reminder , how beautiful and magical our universe is , and that it allows the creative , clever sh@@ ines allowed to form them in a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive industrial and economic potential , is the dot of the dot on the i .
thank you so much .
in front of 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes in a very far away galax@@ y is much faster , they walked so the mass of three s@@ uns in a tenth of a tenth in pure energy .
this short moment worked brigh@@ ter than all stars together in all the galax@@ ies of the entire universe .
it was a very big Kn@@ u@@ ine .
they didn &apos;t use their energy in the form of light .
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was given into space @-@ time pro@@ gres@@ sing and the universe explo@@ ded into gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we first arrange the events in time .
in front of 1.3 billion years ago , he was only sur@@ round life on earth .
since then the earth has emerged : cor@@ als , fish , plants , sau@@ rier , people , and -- God stand us with -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of particularly mu@@ g -- R@@ ai Weiss from MIT , K@@ IP Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver of the C@@ alt@@ ech -- a giant laser detector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves created by col@@ li@@ ding black holes .
most held them for crazy .
but enough people recognised it as a mad gen@@ ius , so that the U.S. National Science Foundation financed their idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely much hard work they built the detector L@@ IG@@ O : the Laser Inter@@ fer@@ omet@@ ry Gra@@ vit@@ ational Observatory .
in the follow @-@ up time , the precision of L@@ IG@@ O increased significantly , which greatly improved the detection performance .
therefore you are called Advanced L@@ IG@@ O now .
at the beginning of September 2015 L@@ IG@@ O was launched for a final test run by some smaller , persistent problems .
on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the start of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves prop@@ elled the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hug@@ hes : just two moments in my life were emotional than this :
the Birth of my daughter
and the goo@@ db@@ ye to my to@@ d@@ ill father .
basically they were the fruits of my life .
all this , what I had worked , is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hug@@ hes , theoretical physi@@ cist on the MIT since 23 years and its end@@ vit@@ ational signals like L@@ IG@@ O measuring signals . what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is an forces in the encoder of space and time .
when moving the shaft , the space and its entire content will be stretched into one direction and spread into the other .
in relation to illustr@@ ative do@@ z@@ ers in Kur@@ sen , theory of theory often often have a correct dancing dance .
&quot; stretching and dust , stretching and dust . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous .
on the 14th of September , for example , each one of us was stretched out and distur@@ bed by us . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average people was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that means 20 n@@ ul@@ ls according to the comm@@ ma , followed by a 1 . therefore we declared the L@@ IG@@ O people for crazy .
with a five @-@ kilometre laser detector , and this is ab@@ sur@@ d , this length would have to be measured at less than a thous@@ and@@ ths of a radius of a nuclear power . that is gr@@ ot@@ es@@ k .
at the end of its classical text about grav@@ itation
described K@@ IP Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder L@@ IG@@ Os , the hunt for the waves like this : &quot; the technical difficulties when construction of such detectors are mighty .
but physi@@ c@@ ists are inv@@ ari@@ zed and with the support of the public will be overcome all obstacles . &quot;
Thor@@ ne released this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to L@@ IG@@ O . Scott claims that L@@ IG@@ O may be more an ear than one eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than the things about us : fac@@ i@@ als , the size of your mobile phone .
that &apos;s quite practical . for so you can easily get a picture or a map of things by taking out that of several points coming around you .
with tones this is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters .
therefore it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that are particularly important :
about the face of your child .
instead , we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and height , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it .
&quot; now Alice says Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob leaves her . &quot;
&quot; D@@ ept Bob &quot; .
the same is true for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we can &apos;t produce any simple pictures of objects in all .
but having regard to changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to us their stories .
at least the measured frequencies are measured in the audi@@ ble range for L@@ IG@@ O .
so when we convert wave pattern in sound , we can hear the all literally .
the engra@@ v@@ itation too no@@ ises can us betra@@ y us about the coll@@ ision of two black holes with which my colleague Scott has already worked very long .
SH : two black , not rotating holes , circulation : w@@ up@@ p !
turn the two bodies very fast , you hear the same circulation with an additional sound exchange . that sounds like this : w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u !
it is a kind of motion set , shaped into the wav@@ e@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a Date , which at least I never forget -- heard L@@ IG@@ O the following : &#91; Sur@@ render &#91; sound &#93; J@@ enny , who knows what he must hear , recognize this as sound : 30 times the sun mass , that turns around as fast as the bars of your mixer .
AA : superior to us what that meant .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in all , one with a mass of 29 s@@ uns , the other with a mass of 36 c@@ uns , revol@@ ve one hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine this forces before .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we have heard it .
there is the permanent meaning of L@@ IG@@ O .
L@@ IG@@ O is a completely new way to explore the universe as they never had previously been possible .
on this way we can listen to the All and the invisible .
many in all , we can &apos;t see - practically or in principle -- not possible .
a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ie stars explo@@ de in Super@@ nov@@ ae .
they are very useful . of them we have learned a lot about that .
the thr@@ illing physical events occur in the core , which is behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon hidden .
we will never see , since these op@@ ak are .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are penet@@ rating iron , as it would be transparent glass . the Ur@@ gn@@ all : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it because the jung@@ le is covered by his own neigh@@ bor .
using gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , it should be possible to re@@ look back to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I &apos;m optim@@ istic about that in all things we have never seen that we never see , and from which we don &apos;t have any idea . things we only discover , we hear that we hear .
in fact L@@ IG@@ O was in the first start of all things that we had not expected .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the L@@ IG@@ O project , says to this topic : me : the type of stars that produce black holes are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient body from prehistoric times . the black holes are so to speak the Sau@@ ri@@ erk@@ no@@ che for our archaeological work .
L@@ IG@@ O allows us to introduce a completely different angles on the events of all , on the creation of the stars and ultimately to make it out of this chaos .
AA : the challenge is now to be as cour@@ age@@ ous as possible .
thanks to L@@ IG@@ O we know how to listen a great Det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and circulation of the cos@@ mos .
we need ideas for new ob@@ servatory -- a brand new generation of ob@@ servatory on earth and in all .
for what could be more beautiful than the ur@@ inary yourself ?
now the time is great dreams .
dreams with us .
thanks . thank you .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one year I would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was afraid because of whom I feared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter whether it made me nerv@@ ous , me in un@@ pleasant situations , I forced me to say &quot; Yes &quot; .
would I speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
do I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
wanted to start playing with the scene ?
no , no , no , yes , yes .
and a mad thing happened to do exactly what I feared , I feared my fear .
my fear to keep spe@@ ech@@ es , my social fear -- Pu@@ ff , gone .
the Power of a Word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , my life changed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , I changed .
but there was a certain Yes that changed my life to an un@@ expect@@ edly . it started with a question of my sheep .
I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls for un@@ explained reasons , &quot;
as if it were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; war@@ ks , I need milk for my Schn@@ ak @-@ asse &quot;
she asked them once to play with her , when I was just on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
a new life setting in my family . from there I swe@@ ars to me , always with them once you want to call me . no matter what I &apos;m doing , or where I go , I say always yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I tired me very much .
it has a magical effect on me , on my children , on our family .
but it also has a tri@@ cky tri@@ bution : only recently , I was completely understood that the &quot; Yes &quot; Say on playing with my children my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am a writer . I think of things , go up to life .
dream job .
no . no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create television . I be@@ ac@@ companies TV .
I do TVs , in large style .
in this TV @-@ season , I am responsible for the saving of 70 hours of program into the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are in production simultaneously .
each broadcast has hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV station can lie between three and six million dollars .
we say five .
a new episode all nine days ago , four television programmes , four television programmes , 70 hours TV , three programmes , which are at the same time in production , time four , 16 episodes : Sc@@ and@@ al , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Living , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America , my TV series continued on Thursday night .
all over the world , my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is globally , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts that I have created itself , and not only produced , so still ob@@ sol@@ ete . I have time to find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans and tell my stories .
four television series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires that burning around the world .
do you know who still does that ?
no one , why am I a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to im@@ press you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I say it , because I know what you think the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I tell you that all of you who work as hard to whether you &apos;re now a company , a country or a class@@ room , allowing me to understand that I do not only say on the computer and fant@@ as@@ iere , and it &apos;s right if I say : I understand that there is not a dream job .
it is all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , everything swe@@ at -- no tears .
I work much , hard and I love it .
if I &apos;m deeper into working , there is no other feeling .
my work creates always a land from the nothing .
it is , when I set up troops when I painted on a canvas .
so as dre@@ ds a high sound , lie@@ ve a marathon .
it feels like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
it is creative , mechanically , str@@ en@@ tive and in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ating , funny and mut@@ ually , clin@@ ically and rati@@ onal , cruel , and rati@@ onal , and the best thing is that the Sum@@ mary is .
there is so a change in me when work is well done .
a bu@@ zz begins in my head , and it grows and growing , and the bu@@ zz hears as a busy street , I could go for ever on it .
many people assume , if I explain to them the sum@@ s that I talk to it , that the writing has been prepared for me .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , that does it .
but the sum@@ s -- when I started working with television production , when I began working and to work and to work , I discovered this thing , this sum@@ s , this energy .
the bu@@ zz is more than that writing .
the sum@@ s is action and activity . the sum@@ s is a drug .
the bu@@ zz is music . the sum@@ s is light and air .
the bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have a sum@@ s , then you can not stri@@ ve any other than size .
the feeling , not unlike the size , regardless of size , no matter what price .
this is how you call the sum@@ s .
or perhaps it means a workflow .
maybe it is called gen@@ ius .
perhaps it is called E@@ go .
perhaps it &apos;s fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I only know that I &apos;m not for failure , and I only know that I love the sum@@ s .
I just want to say to you , I am a titanium , and I know that I don &apos;t want it to question .
to make a clear : ever more shows , more episodes , the more about the time , the more work , the more things the time , the more about me , the more do I write history , the more more expectations exist .
the more I work to be successful , the more you have to work .
and what do I do about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the land that I create , the marathon , whom I run , the army , the high clay , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s .
I like this sum@@ s . I love the sum@@ s .
I need the sum@@ s . I &apos;m the sum@@ s .
am I only that sum@@ s ?
and then the sum@@ s stopped .
revised , over@@ taken , ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated , dra@@ g@@ ged .
the sum@@ s stopped .
now my three daughters are reconc@@ iled to the truth that their m@@ om is a single working title .
Har@@ per told people : &quot; my m@@ om will not be there , but you can write to my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they will go to Sh@@ on@@ da land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are the children of a titanium .
they are Baby @-@ Titan@@ en .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sum@@ s stopped .
the sum@@ s of the engine collap@@ sed .
I loved my work no more . the engine was off .
the sum@@ s came not back .
my sum@@ s was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same titanium @-@ work , 15 hours @-@ day , continuous week , no Reu@@ e , nothing deleg@@ ate , does not sleep , with all your heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no sum@@ s .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a show @-@ showing @-@ Titan ,
everything was gray , I just had no fun .
and that was my life .
all that I did .
I was the sum@@ s and the sum@@ s I was .
so what do you do if things are doing , the work that you love , suddenly causes me ?
I know , some may think : &quot; Heu@@ l you from , stup@@ id man &apos;s author . &quot;
but you know you &apos;re doing , you &apos;re doing what you do is one teacher , a painter , bill Gates , one who knows how to feel the sum@@ s , and knows how to stop the sum@@ s when the sum@@ s stop when the sum@@ s stop , who is one then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a titanium ?
if the song of my heart hear@@ eth , I can survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; south states &apos; cell@@ ars &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; a question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way to the outside , too late and she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , you &apos;re playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I will tell no , when two things are aware of :
first , I have to say Yes to anything and second , she called me not &quot; E@@ valu@@ ate . &quot;
they call no more &quot; E@@ valu@@ ate . &quot;
when is this happening ?
I miss it , if I &apos;m titanium and my sum@@ s , and here everything change my own eyes .
and so she says : &quot; m@@ om , do you play ? &quot;
and I say : &quot; yes . &quot;
it is nothing special about it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we play and play their sisters , we laugh at much and I read completely dramatic from the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nothing exceptional .
but it is outstanding because my pain and my pan@@ ic , in the lon@@ el@@ iness and in the absence of the sum@@ ming , I can do nothing but can fit .
I &apos;m focusing on .
I am quiet .
the land that I create , the marathon , whom I run , the army , the high sound - they do no more .
everything that exists st@@ icky fingers and mo@@ ist k@@ is@@ ses , tender voices , juni@@ per pins and the song , in which it &apos;s a lot , or whatever is the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simp@@ licity .
the air in this place is so short that I can hardly bre@@ athe .
I can hardly believe that I am .
play is the opposite of work .
and I &apos;m happy .
something in me dis@@ solves .
an mental door goes on and an energy boost comes in .
and that is not immediately , but it happens .
I feel it .
the sum@@ s come back slowly .
no full volume , hardly there , it is quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the sum@@ s , but a sum@@ s .
and now I feel that I would know a magical mystery .
but let us remain with the cause .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it &apos;s something that we have forgotten .
the bu@@ zz , the work table , the titanium um@@ ms , that is only the replacement .
if I ask you , if I tell you , who am I , if I cast me out using broad@@ casts and TV hours and how working my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum@@ s is .
the sum@@ s is no strength and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it is dependent on the joy .
the real sum@@ s depends on love .
the bu@@ zz is the river which comes from the life of life .
the real sum@@ s is self @-@ conscious and peace .
the real sum@@ s igno@@ res the pressure of history , to do the tasks , anticip@@ ation and pressure .
the real sum@@ s is simple and original .
the real sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps whis@@ per@@ ed to God the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a titanium ?
it just is love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
once my child I want to play with me I will tell Yes .
I &apos;m doing this for a fixed rule , so I can deliver me as a workflow for every fault .
it is a law , I have no other option . I don &apos;t have any choice , if I want to hear the sum@@ s again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
play for me not as a full way , how to work .
the truth does wo@@ e ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work , because I love it .
I am more than at the workplace as at home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permission is painful , for what kind of man is better than to be home ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , I am .
hon@@ est@@ ly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I am too you , is none of them .
we got around in the garden , back and back .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we cr@@ ushed soap bub@@ bles .
I feel mostly sti@@ ff@@ les , ab@@ sent and conf@@ used .
I always mature after my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how you live , and the sum@@ s of the universe met me .
I play and play , until I ask myself : why did we play with the games ?
you can also say it ! if your child would like to play with you .
perhaps you will keep me for n@@ ai@@ v , for an instructor .
there is well right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones would like to play with me most 15 minutes with me until they try something else .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes , a Marien@@ kä@@ fer or cook@@ ie will replace me .
and my te@@ ie daughter speaks for 15 minutes long with me , I am Mother of the Year .
there are only 15 minutes , more needs it .
everybody can put 15 minutes on a piece , even on a bad @-@ mood !
15 minutes on a piece !
no mobile phone , no clothes , no di@@ stra@@ ctions .
the day is short : dinner , the children are bet@@ ting .
but 15 minutes are inside !
my children are my well@@ feeling , my world . there is not to be the children . it is to feel the sum@@ s to feel a place for his soul @-@ peace .
it is not for playing with your own children . it comes to joy ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; around the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; games &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
get the 15 minutes !
find out what you doing well .
find out and store it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I che@@ ers and I lost . friends meet , books read , the day will enjoy --
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; it is short for everything I got up when I got my first TV show when I got a titanium in training when I got myself more and more .
15 minutes on the piece , why do not get rid of 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the bu@@ zz came back in my leisure time . the sum@@ s seems to return , if I don &apos;t work .
working does not work without any games .
it takes time , but after a few months , a door opens , and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown mel@@ ody , it satis@@ fies me and my soul . she ref@@ uses me to new ideas . I use it in full breeding and love my work again .
I like the bu@@ zz , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I &apos;m not the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s is not I ... no more .
soap bub@@ bles and st@@ icky fingers , dinner with friends .
now that is my sum@@ s .
the sw@@ ings of life .
the sw@@ ings of love .
the sum@@ s of work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so than@@ k@@ ful .
I &apos;m sorry that I am a titanium . I &apos;ve never seen a titanium , the trip to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything in the handle . my brain is still working . my bon@@ fire is still burning .
the more I play , the more happy I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel like a good mother .
the more I play , the more clear@@ er is my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ s . the land that I create , the marathon , whom I run , the troops , the high sound , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum of life .
the more I feel this sum@@ s , the more makes this unusual , be@@ ac@@ ulate , naked and new life feeling in me wide . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel exactly this sum@@ s , the more I know who I am .
I am a writer . I think about things , I awake to life .
this belongs to the job , which means to live his dream .
this is the dream of this jobs ,
because a dream job should be a little dreams .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; to less work and more games .
Titan@@ ums have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very nice .
I am neuro@@ surgery .
as most of my colleagues I have to do with human tragedy every day .
I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a heavy stroke or after a car accident .
for us Neuro@@ sur@@ geon it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organic , has a very low ability to help self @-@ healing .
after a severe injury of the central nerv@@ ous system , patients often have a permanent , heavy disability .
this is probably the reason why I was working in neuro@@ surgery .
what is a functional Neuro@@ sur@@ geon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerv@@ ous functions through various surgical action .
certainly they have heard of one of the most well @-@ known , the &quot; deep cer@@ eb@@ stim@@ ulation . &quot; it im@@ planted a electro@@ de deep in the brain in order to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons so that the neuro@@ logical function enh@@ ances itself .
it is really an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Park@@ inson , who suffered severe cit@@ ations and heavy pain .
however Neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ surgery is the restoration of the brain .
my opinion , we are looking forward to this dream .
I want to show you that we are very close to you .
help the brain help yourself .
the story started 15 years ago .
at the time I was conduc@@ tive public doctor and working day and night in the emergency capacity .
I often supplied patients with skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
you need to imagine that for cran@@ ks @-@ brain trau@@ mat@@ a brain , the brain rel@@ ap@@ t and the cran@@ ial pressure is rising .
to save life , you have to reduce the cran@@ ial pressure .
you have to remove one part of the s@@ wollen brain mass .
rather than t@@ oss the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyze with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a biolog@@ ist , the brain compound .
what can I do with it ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is no light task .
cells from a piece of tissue , is comparable to all small children who are taken out of your families .
you need to find the right diet , temperature , moisture and environments to th@@ ri@@ ve them .
exactly that we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts it was managed by Jean François @-@ François .
this he saw under his micro@@ scope .
that was a surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with great green cells that are surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells .
perhaps you can still know from the biograph@@ ical lessons that stem cells are un@@ ripe , that can transform itself into every cell type of organ@@ ism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small niche of brain .
it is surprising to receive this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain compound in surgery .
we made a further fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are imm@@ ort@@ al .
but these cells were different .
they were slowly and after a few weeks she died even .
thus , we saw a new , wei@@ rd cellular population which looked like the stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed long to understand where they arrived .
they origin@@ ate from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ b@@ lec@@ tic in positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our cer@@ eb@@ ral cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the fet@@ us they provide for the folding of the brain .
but why do they get to us ?
we do not know this .
we believe that they take part in the healing of the brain since we find it in higher concentrations close to brain injury .
but this is not so safe .
one thing is however clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells .
we stand in front of a potential cell source which enables brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain compound in the non @-@ lingu@@ istic area and then the cells exactly are cultivated as it did Jean @-@ François .
and they then have colored colour to trace them in the brain .
in the last step , we im@@ planted them at the decision of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ ologist Tran@@ splan@@ tation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we im@@ planted these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we im@@ planted the same cells in f@@ ooth@@ ed brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we were able to work with apes .
in the first scenario , we im@@ planted the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that they had taken away after some weeks , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they are not used there , so they van@@ ish it .
in the second scenario , we attached a violation and im@@ planted the same cells , and now the cells remain -- it grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could watch under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were im@@ planted .
the evidence that they show , these small points are these small points . these are the cells that we painted in vitro .
of course we could not stop .
help these cells also a wise monkeys to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained no monkey with a manual skill problem .
they had to take food pellets from a tray .
they did very well .
as they achieved a stabil@@ ized skill level , we used the motor @-@ motor Cort@@ ex in motor Cort@@ ex .
then the monkeys were par@@ aly@@ sed , they couldn &apos;t move their hand .
just as it would happen to people , they recovered spontan@@ e@@ ously to a certain degree , exactly as after a stroke .
the patients are par@@ aly@@ zed and then try to recover from the plastic brain mechanisms . they recover a certain degree , just as the wise monkeys .
when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontan@@ eous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left side you see the monkey , who recovered spontan@@ e@@ ously .
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its original power from injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
now , when we im@@ planted the cells , the same monkey , two months after m@@ im@@ plantation .
I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us .
since that time we found out much more about these cells .
we can use them to freeze and later .
we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example with Park@@ inson .
but our dream is still to im@@ plant them in humans .
I really hope that I can soon show you how the human brain gives the means to heal themselves .
thank you so much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , this is wonderful , I &apos;m sure now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know someone who need this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I definitely want .
of course , the question is what the largest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials in humans .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the greatest obstacles are the authorities . based on this great results you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this kind of studies .
BG : it is under@@ stand@@ able , the brain is very del@@ ic@@ ate etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and a professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to the start of clinical trials . if you continue to see in the future , as many years it takes , until som@@ eb@@ ody can come to hospital , and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first it depends on the approval of clinical study .
will the authority allow us to start soon ?
then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select the patient to perform treatments and assess whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
then you have to apply it to a mul@@ tic@@ entr@@ e study .
you must first prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment each .
BG : and that &apos;s sure , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting T@@ ED and that you have told us about it .
BG : thank you so much .
democracy .
in the West we make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course .
we see the democracy not as frag@@ ile plant that is in reality , but as the Invent@@ ory of our society .
we tend to consider it as a non @-@ altered .
we believe that capitalism leads to democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing have said that it is possible to have a blo@@ oming capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely indisp@@ utable .
indeed , democracy is dis@@ sem@@ inated with us in Europe .
at the beginning of the year , when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was declared un@@ am@@ big@@ uous by the finance minister in the Euro@@ group -- our elections -- not affect the savings programs which have been realised in Greece .
at this moment , I thought that there could be no better just@@ ification for Lee Ku@@ on Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my beloved friends who would repeat me when it would change anything .
at this point I would like to introduce a economic model for real democracy .
I pray you , together with me , again to believe that Lee Ku@@ on Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of wrong believe we could save the democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ en@@ tive democracy .
because without democracy our companies are producing , our future jets and our great , new technologies are w@@ asted .
for the issue of waste , I would like to point to an interesting contra@@ diction which is currently threat@@ ening our host .
I call it the &quot; twin peaks &quot; Par@@ ad@@ ox . &quot;
a summit is known to you . they know and recognize him as the Deb@@ t mountain , who th@@ rows his long shade about the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the Schul@@ den@@ berg ,
yet only few recognize his Di@@ dy@@ mus .
a mountain of un@@ used cash , which belongs to the as@@ ible savings and corpor@@ ations , however , to invest where it would be productive and income could produce and even all the things that humanity ur@@ gently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months , in the US , in England and in the Eurozone , 3.4 trillion US dollars have been invested in all the wealth of producing goods , such as industrial facilities , machinery , office buildings , schools , streets , tracks , and so on .
in a lot of money , the 3.4 trillion US dollars is compared to a lot of money , compared to the same time in the same time and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing did , except the stock ex@@ ams and the property prices are over@@ thrown .
thus , debt and un@@ productive capital will not form the twin peaks that cannot be compens@@ ated by the usual market mechanisms of market mechanisms .
the result are stag@@ n@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ old in the US , Japan and Europe , and therefore a low overall economic demand , which could not promote themselves in which they do not invest . just like Ö@@ di@@ pus Father , who would not invest in mind that his son would kill him if he is growing ,
un@@ rolled the circumstances that lead to it that Ö@@ di@@ pus kill him k@@ ills him .
this is my Ha@@ des with capitalism --
its extremely refined capital art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to further improve the human talents and to finance particular all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies which are crucial for the salvation of the earth .
is it democracy the solution ?
I think so . but before we continue : what do we understand under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ el@@ es defined democracy as the social form , in which the free and the poor serves as a majority to control the government .
the Ath@@ en@@ ical Democracy finally concluded too many --
women , foreigners , and natural slaves .
it would be an error , the value of Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy due to these in@@ clusions .
the decision on the Ath@@ en@@ ic democracy was and that they gave not only the right to free expression , and not only the right to free expression of opinion , but import@@ antly , they agree to them the right to political participation in questions of the State stick .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not kept long --
like a candle that illumin@@ ates very bright , it is also rapidly spread .
however , our present liber@@ als demo@@ cra@@ cies did not have their roots in the ancient Athens ,
but in Magna Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on the free citizens , our liberal democracy is based on the Magna Cart@@ a , which ultimately proved an ordinance for ruling .
for the liberal democracy occurred only when a complete separation from politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was entered into politics , while the economy -- thus the world of the concert -- a demo@@ cra@@ rati@@ e@@ free zone .
in our present demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time that this separation from politics and economy began , an un@@ erb@@ ated struggle between the two , by the economy hi@@ ves the policy gradually and ma@@ stered it .
are you wonder@@ ing why the politicians isn &apos;t like so earlier ?
it is not in a de@@ generation of its DNA .
it lies in mind that it can be in the government today and still not at power because the power of politics is ab@@ hor@@ red in the economy and separated the areas .
I mentioned my Ha@@ des with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is like a herd of pir@@ ates , which is so su@@ stain@@ ably the animals of which they feed themselves , that they are hungry at the end .
similarly , with the economy that has caused politics as far as far , it grows through the self @-@ caused economic crisis itself . the power of the corpor@@ ations growing , political goods , the overall economic situation is rising and the general manager of the corpor@@ ations are to invest , the cash of their company will invest .
ever on the success of capitalism , &quot; demo@@ s &quot; &#91; the people &#93; from democracy , the higher will become the twin peaks , and the more the waste of human workers and the well@@ being of mankind .
if that is true , it is obvious that we must bring the politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; control reserves , as in the ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
this is not a new idea .
the Marx@@ ist Lin@@ ke had the idea 100 years ago and it didn &apos;t be especially strange .
the doctrine of the de@@ ac@@ ity of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only reg@@ ained a position as in the ancient Athens , without creating new species of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is a solution : to put the poor poor !
capitalism does it by being replaced low wages by automation and robots .
the problem is that long economy and politics are separate areas , automation can become higher , the automation of tw@@ ins higher , and the social conflicts are deeper , as it is already very soon as I think -- in countries like China will come .
so we have to combine the economy and un@@ ite the areas of economy and politics , and make sure that we need the re@@ unified area , otherwise we end the film &quot; Matrix &quot; as a documentation .
so the question is not whether the capitalism is the technical achievements , which he has brought forth , will survive --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is like a D@@ yst@@ op@@ ie , similar to that in &quot; Star Trek , &quot; it is similar to humans and helping people to serve their energy into the expl@@ oring of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the Anci@@ ent Ath@@ en@@ ian &quot; Ag@@ ora &quot; in long talks with the sense of life .
I think we may be optim@@ istic .
so what would it look like it could look like this &quot; star Trek &quot; -@@ like Utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; like similar D@@ yst@@ op@@ ie ?
in the practical implementation I would like to give you some examples in all brief , some examples .
in the field of companies : please make a capital market that allows you to earn money , while you are working with your capital to the next , from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter what you &apos;re currently working -- is the property of those working in the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then comes all income from capital and dis@@ sol@@ ving and the concept of labour work is completely overhau@@ led . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no differentiation between those who belong to companies which are not working there , but employees working there , to whom the company does not belong to the company , but no great g@@ aps between investment and coils , and ultimately cannot be taken up to the twin peaks .
in the field of global political economy , please make sure that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which will be issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interests of all mankind will be issued .
&quot; &quot; &quot; imagine that the whole world trade will be tra@@ ded in this currency -- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kos@@ mos &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in units of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kos@@ mos &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and every government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trading income of the country to a common fund . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine that this fund has invested in &quot; green &quot; technologies , particularly in parts of the world , in which investment funds are ra@@ r .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed in the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference in 1944 .
the problem was that you didn &apos;t plan to implement the technical resources at that time .
today we have , in particular , especially in the background of a recovered policy and business .
the world that I drove you , is becoming more liberal , in which they preferred privileged individuals and mar@@ x@@ istic because they will have buried the separation of capital and work in the tr@@ ash of history , and key@@ nes@@ ian , globally key@@ nes@@ ian .
but above all others it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
are we awak@@ ening in such a world
or are we going to drop into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar D@@ yst@@ op@@ ie ?
the answer depends on how we decide on it polit@@ ically .
it is in our hands , and we do it better .
thanks . thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Y@@ an@@ is ...
you gave yourself a liberal Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Y@@ an@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I said just is relevant , Marx is relevant .
the reason for re@@ unification of politics and economy ... do not do this , technological development will produce a massive decline in overall demand , as Larry Sum@@ mers referred to as a long @-@ term stag@@ nation . &quot;
through the transfer of this crisis from a part of the earth to the next , as we are currently experien@@ cing it , it will not only be able to dest@@ abil@@ ize our democratic , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is small .
when this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant ,
likewise , as Hay@@ ek , therefore I am a liberal Marx@@ ist , and how Key@@ nes , and therefore I am entirely rest@@ art@@ ed .
BG : actually , and now we are too .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a sort of philosoph@@ ical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein , who said that . BG : in your lecture , you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of Red@@ ner you have said very clearly , what you keep from the view of the West to China .
do you want to repeat this here ?
Y@@ V : there is a large degree of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democracy we have the licence of democracy .
as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy on politics , while the area where most of the economy re@@ play , -- the area of the economy -- a completely demo@@ cra@@ y@@ e@@ free zone .
in a certain way , if I may say the so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar to the England of the 19th century .
because -- remember -- We tend to connect liber@@ alism to democracy -- that is an error , historical viewed .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , such as John Stuart Mill --
he was especially sk@@ ep@@ tical , aff@@ ecting the democratic development .
what can be seen now in China , resem@@ bles the development which we had in England during the industrial revolution , particularly the transition from the first to the second .
China now aim to do that which the West has done in the 19th century , cra@@ w@@ ells amazing according to hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I &apos;m sure that many list@@ eners experienced to your experiences as finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I guess that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back for six months later on the first half ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal view , and very dis@@ appo@@ inting , because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
namely , from the self @-@ f@@ low@@ ance to say goo@@ db@@ ye , and permanently den@@ ying that a massive re@@ jection line went out through the euro zone , and continues to massi@@ vely the development of the whole European Union .
we had the opportunity to agree on the Greek demonstrations -- by the way , the first proposal to den@@ ying these den@@ ies --
unfortunately it is right to do . unfortunately , the powers have chosen within the Eurozone , within the European Group , continues to den@@ ies .
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if one tries to receive an economic system that is not over@@ powered by political will and auth@@ itar@@ ism , it might be quite a while , but if the shift occurs , he ab@@ rupt@@ ly ab@@ rupt@@ ly and destroyed .
BG : what change do you see ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone does not have any future if we do not change its structure .
BG : did you make any mist@@ akes in your business as a finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back - harvest@@ ers ...
if there is a finance minister , or any ministers after 6 months in office , particularly in a stressed situation , claims that he did not make any mist@@ akes , then it is a dangerous person .
of course I made mist@@ akes .
the greatest error was to sign the application for the extension of the school program at the end of February .
I believed that there was a hon@@ est interest on pages of the money , to find a common solution .
but that was not there .
they merely wanted to fall our government only because they don &apos;t want to deal with the Ver@@ sions that ran through the euro area .
they didn &apos;t want to stand out that they had a cat@@ astroph@@ ic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
there is worse than the Great Depression . &quot;
none of the Tro@@ ika of the Tro@@ ika , who gave us this policy , stressed : &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot;
BG : despite all these , and despite the aggressive tone of talks , you seem to be quite a pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my criticism of the European Union and the euro zone opposite to someone who lives and loves Europe .
my biggest fear is that the Eurozone did not survive .
for if they were not survi@@ ves , the released Fli@@ eh@@ ead D@@ ä@@ mon@@ isch and the European Union shall destroy .
this will not have cat@@ astroph@@ ic consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire world economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we propose to propose the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 , then it appears to be as well as the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope that you are wrong in this point .
Y@@ an@@ is , thank you that you were at T@@ ED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
apart from Roy Price , most of them never heard although it is likely to be responsible for 22 medium minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very enjoyable minutes , but not for many of you .
that goes back to the decision , the Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is a senior employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
he is 47 years old , slim , has a I@@ gel@@ fr@@ is@@ ur and describes on Twitter as &quot; Mo@@ vies , TV , Technology , Tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job , because he is responsible for the shows and contents of the Amazon .
of course , this is a very hard fighting industry .
there are already so many TV shows that Roy cannot select anywhere .
he must show shows that are very good .
in other words , he must find shows that are on the right at that turn .
this curve is the evaluation division of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the evaluation goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows are obtained .
if your show is valued at nine and above , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad &quot; , &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are ad@@ dic@@ tive after one of the season , your brain asks : &quot; where is there any more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left , here at this end shows shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what goes to that at the end of the turn .
Roy Price does not take away because of the left side of the turn , because I think it takes special intelligence , to &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes himself more thoughts about the middle ex@@ ul@@ ance , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they just in@@ spire them .
so he must ensure that he is really on the right side .
the pressure is present and of course it is the first time that Amazon is something like that , Roy Price wants to risk nothing .
he wants to create successes .
he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a contest .
he takes up many ideas for TV shows and chosen by an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and will show them online , where they can view each one for free .
and if an Amazon is free of vain , you feel right ?
millions of spectators watching these episodes .
however , they do not know that they are observed at the view of these shows .
they are observed by Roy and his team that record everything .
when you start the show , when you p@@ auses , which parts can be over@@ seen or again .
they collect millions of data to decide with these data then decide what show they should produce .
indeed , collect the data , process and this is the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ Com over four Republi@@ can US trans@@ formers . &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; alpha House , &quot; but it seems that no many of these show can remember because it was not so good .
it is only an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- since the average of these curve is 7.4 and Alpha House lan@@ det at 7.5 -- thus somewhat above average , but not just that which Roy and his team worked .
about the same time with another company , another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . its name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always looking for finding this one super @-@ show and it also uses data for it , but he makes it something different .
instead of a contest , he and his team list@@ ened to the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x viewer , so the reviews they give the shows their course , what shows they like etc .
then use this data to find these small details about the audience : what shows they like those manufacturers , what actors .
when they had all the parts together they entered a car , and decided to make no sit@@ Com over four trans@@ formers , but a drama series about a Senator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards &quot; . Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.1 rating on this curve . so exactly there where they wanted to go .
of course is the question : what is happening here ?
it has two very competent , data di@@ versi@@ fied companies .
they combine these many data and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic indicates that it should work in all .
if you g@@ athers millions of data for a decision to meet you , then you should make a good decision .
one has 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
it is optimized through very powerful computer .
the least what you can expect is good TV , or ?
if data analysis does not work , then it &apos;s somewhat terri@@ fying because we live in a time in which we want more and more to statistics to meet serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health System ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health system is a software company and I hope that no one in this room ever comes into contact with this software . come in touch , you are in prison .
if anyone asks here in the US in prison and to release , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine if an office is made or not .
just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but rather than decide whether a show is good or bad , it is decided whether a person will be good or bad .
medium television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that these data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are generated . this is not sure that a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
the data di@@ versi@@ fied firms are wrong .
yes , even Google makes no error .
in 2009 Google announced that they can predi@@ ct up@@ out@@ breaks of influenza , which can predi@@ ct any way through data analysis of Google research .
it worked wonder@@ fully and was a great news . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the journal Nature . &quot;
it worked just fine , year around year , until there was no longer working ,
and no one could say why .
it was simply not working , this was again a sensation , including the publication of the publication in the journal Nature . &quot;
even the data are experienced , such as Amazon and Google are sometimes im@@ aging .
in spite of all these bugs , data streams into decisions of life -- at the workplace , on the right of law , in medicine .
so we should rather ensure that data are helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in the computer @-@ based genet@@ ics -- an area where some very wise men can use un@@ imagin@@ able many data to meet serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years I detected some samples of the difference between successful decisions using the data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
do you need to solve a complex problem , do mostly two things :
as a mark you will put this problem in its components , so that you can analyze the individual components ; as a second time you set the individual components again to deal with a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : apart and put together again .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to dis@@ assemble and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to put the parts again and then to come to an end .
for this there is another tool and we all have : our brain .
if there is something that the brain is good , it is parts and pieces again together , even if the information is incomplete , to deal with a good decision -- especially when the brain is an expert .
therefore , I think , was Net@@ fli@@ x so successful because they have used data and understanding , where they also belong to the process .
they ut@@ ili@@ ze data to understand their audience , what else they would have been able to have . but the decision to set up all these parts , and make it a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; which does not stand in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they entered a great personal risk with this decision .
on the other hand , on the other hand , on the wrong way .
they used to control all their decisions , first in order to contest TV ideas , then as they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
it was a secure decision because they always could say : &quot; they say the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better choices , but I think things do not run when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are only a tool , and to forget that , this device is rather useful .
many of you will be ...
before there were data , it was the tool for decisions .
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it is amazing . for decisions by a J@@ a- or no @-@ question you have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; highly likely &quot; -- exactly here at this moment .
I will see it later with a technique demo .
so far I met some of the decisions in my life , where I should have list@@ ened to the ball .
but , as you know of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them with a little bit f@@ ences , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but that does not change the basic body .
so , perhaps the ball valve and smart . finally , it is to meet us to meet decisions when we want to reach something unusual at the end of the right turn .
and I &apos;m sensitive to this as very encour@@ aging news that it is still missing in spite of the great amount of data , making decisions to be an expert in what you do , and to enter risks .
because at the end , it is not the data , but the risks of which you land at the right end of the turn .
thank you very nice .
