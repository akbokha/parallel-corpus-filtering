<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">They might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as New York Times Reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">For a long time ever before someone heard Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he released the NSA illegally detained by Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter which should leave a permanent impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">It describes a catastrophic US secret service operation in which the CIA had literally overthrew their designs for a atomic bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, you read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who didn't know the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years, the government has determined against Risen and called upon him to name its alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this train, he became the symbol of the government of government, Whistleblower to condemn and journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional Court, the media has the right to publish a secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if Media does not receive this information, and if they cannot protect the identity of the mug they will be priced.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government was crammed with Risen, he did something that many brave reporter did before him: he refused, and said he would prefer to go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk to go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, only days before the trial, something unusual happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although they were present for many years, the demands of the government were dropped upon rats.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in time electronic monitoring, Reporter and sources can still hide less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead, instead of failure and crises to bring it, they could do his digital footsteps for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so, the investigator, without his incomprehension, worry, his phone is secret,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his e-mail data, finance and banana information, its credit card, and even travel information with the list of its flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information they found evidence that they took to Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA-Whistleblower and crack source to condemn.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, that is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect his wounds, Whistleblower, but instead, the judiciary has condemned more than all US governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how to be a problem, especially because the government is too much of their work as secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article about national security had the result that a Whistleblower came to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">Thus we set up the press work on the game that is protected by the first constitutional rate because the government has always increasing more possibilities to pionate all.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as the government's technology allows to handle the rights of replication, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And in fact, they may take up from the moment in which they contact, rather than in the night, in the testimony.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today, there are communications software that had not been written when Risen had written a book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or telephone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such technology is an SecureDrop, an open source appending system for Whistleblower, which was originally developed by the Internet's most famous Aaron Swartz, and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation where I have been working further.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of send an e-mail, go to a news website, as the Washington Post works here.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send documents, as in each ordinary contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These will then be encrypted and stored on a server, which only has the respective news agency.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government cannot affles more information secretly, and many of the information that would like it would be not available from previous.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop, however, is only a small part of the whole to protect the Press Freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately governments of all over the world develop new spy technologies, which are all endangered.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is due to us that not only technology enner like Edward Snowden have a possibility of bringing abuse of abuse. it is so important that we protect the next Whistleblower,</seg>
<seg id="39">Who wants to know about abuse during the supply of soldiers who wants to report of overcrowning hospitals. or the next environmental workers, the alarm to the sedated water of Flint. or a wall-street-Insider, who warns us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">Nevertheless, these technologies were not only made for those who want to uncover crimes, but to protect against our constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks. thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[3 April 2016] The largest data of the story was published.] [the] "Panama Papers" revealed that [...] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness to have a declaration.] this week we were sent by news about a cheque of 11 million documents of local law firm Mozambica</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax bats.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how clients, banks and lawyers to companies like Mossack Fonseca go and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you judge that?"</seg>
<seg id="45">In fact, we actually see the e-mails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland Prime Minister is returned.</seg>
<seg id="48">Also there are reports that a ally-accused of brutal Syrian dictator Baschar al-Assad's paging companies in tax havases.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars would lead to Russia President Vladimir Putin, on a tight friend from children's days, a famous Cellists.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people and others to wait the nervous to the next release, and to the next unveil documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the plot of a agencies or a John-Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It shines from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should this be?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax havens and do not all of their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">In all over the world, media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havases of some few are used to hide their wealth and to donate -- some, which we have been discussing and reveal ourselves since ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people will be very confusing this whole world, and it's hard to understand how this tax havases work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I'll always present me like a Matryoshkapuator.</seg>
<seg id="60">So one company has a company in another company, in another company which makes it almost impossible to understand, who is behind those of this prayer.</seg>
<seg id="61">It may be very difficult for prosecutions and tax authorities as well as journalists or civil society really understand what matters.</seg>
<seg id="62">I think it is interesting that there is less reports about this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because it has so far been no more prominent Americans that came into this scandal in this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not so that there is no other Americans that you hide their fortune in tax havases.</seg>
<seg id="65">But by the principle, after that these tax havases work, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a backup of the Cayman Islands, or even from Delaware, Wyoming, Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">Indeed, it is so that you need less information in some US states to obtain less information to obtain a company than to obtain a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of intransparency in the United States has employees working to school children, school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It is allowed to remove particularly vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this type of behavior that affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to figure out how all this is in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a capped investigations into the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator gave himself as an African ministers, who wanted to bring suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a boat to buy a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really emailed us that all the way up to a lawyer's suggestions, how he might transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all incidents. no one of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course no one has been handed over to it. however, it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It does not work for a single lawyer, who undertaking the secret investigator proposals.</seg>
<seg id="79">It does not work for a single top politician, wrapped in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">This is how the system works through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope this, we must change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">We must change the rules to make this type of behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="83">It's all very angry, as if we could do nothing against it, as if nothing would have changed it, as if it is always the rich and mighty one will give.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a refuge, I see that some things have started to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the last few years we have seen occurrences to more transparency, affecting the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The subject was political attention through British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then the EU measures at national registers at national level, who really is behind companies in Europe, and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the United States hints back.</seg>
<seg id="89">The representatives of both parties have entered a bill in both parliamentary chambers, but this makes not the progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how this Panama resettings, this huge insight into the world of tax havases used as a means to ensure more transparency in the USA and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for changes.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who want to be angry when other people can hide their real identity behind projectors.</seg>
<seg id="93">We need managers in economy that rise and say: "intransparent is not good for business."</seg>
<seg id="94">We need leading politicians that recognize the problem and to finish this kind of intransparent laws through the laws.</seg>
<seg id="95">Together, we can finally terminate the intransparent, which is now able to end this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story of what I had been abducted once and in the trunk of a red Mazdas would have landed.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I finished my design studies, I made a backday sale.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda remained and looked for my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my art works.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was only in the city alone and just made a road trip through the whole country. after that he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him on a beer. he told me as he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">While we paid the bill, I made the mistakes to ask him: "where do you feed this day?"</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he did worse the whole thing," "" "I don't know." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought: "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just learned it. he says he would go to the corps, but I don't know if he is really planning. I don't have abducted in the boot of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small luggage compartment!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard me saying," "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said," "" "Do you like?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">In the night I was in bed, I starred to the ceiling and I thought: "Oh man! what have I mounted to me there?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wildland sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I got up out of the bed, on the tidy pointed to the door, and my bedroom door closed.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork, which he had purchased from me today, depends on his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">That was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my viewing angle.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood than strangers, were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">People on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's take a leap, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I'm unemployed, almost pleite, my roommates and the rent will be increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I knew that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I believe, creativity can make it to be afraid of fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote my best friend and new roommates Brian Chesky: "Brian, I survived, as we could make something to earn. our apartment is available for a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk, with a mattress and a morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a site and established the "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three lucky guests were allowed to sleep at the air base for 20 dollars on wooden floor.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese ham and Omelet tastes completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them through the whole city. when we caught our last guest and got the door to the castle, rigid Brian and I joined us.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and could pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">The things came into rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommates, nate Blecharczyk, joined us as developers.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to figure out if you could make any business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented our investors: "we would like to create a website, on the people public pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the type of rooms whose doors are coming when you pass by.</seg>
<seg id="139">You can then charge wild people on the Internet, where they can stay overnight.</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We were waiting that the missile would have ignited.</seg>
<seg id="142">But did not do it.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still very near of comfort would invest in a business that allows a stranger to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we have learned children, strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you think all things that you can do well. we have designed designs.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Fine Arts, we had learned that design is much more than just the appearance and haptics -- it is the general experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create their trust by design, between humans who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design be like something?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with Design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a tasting of what degree trust we ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort one.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up, if you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone in your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to make you unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your unlocked mobile phone your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This silent trace of panic, which you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts will feel when they open the door first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">For the only thing, what is personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the unlocked cell of a foreigner in the hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most people feel responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">Even the most guests will feel when they stay there.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Only times so, who actually has Al Gores Cell now?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you explain on Twitter so that he is codes for the Office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">They now have experienced what kind of confidence we want to build. I would like to tell you of some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we have changed a small detail on this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor could have been presented once with his name; if he would have told, from whence he comes, how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine, you would have 150 beats, who say all: "he can really hold very well locked mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you should leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-filled feedback system strengthens trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning, we have made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for people to vote negative evidence.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the end we decided to wait until both hosts and guest were submitted to assessments before we set them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people may trust one another, depending on how they are similar to age and housing.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprisingly, we trust the people most, which are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences, we find the less trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social regulation.</seg>
<seg id="181">Exciting, if you add the call of a person -- in our case by assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three admittments, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But it has more than ten, changing everything.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation of fame and similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">So the right design can help us to overcome some of our deep roots.</seg>
<seg id="186">We also knew that confidence is dependent on how much you get from itself.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first news of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">If you're too little, how for example "Hi!," one gets more answer.</seg>
<seg id="189">Tell as much as for example: "I have problems with my mother" -- -- -- the request is not accepted.</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal degree of Openness, such as "Tolle works of art in your apartment! I'm doing with my family vacation."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can we create it with design, restore this degree in Openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text. we also give tips on what topics you should write anything.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company relies on hope that the right design can help to overcome our foreheads compared to strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">As we were not expected, the large amount of people who were more than prepared to submit these deposits.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take our special offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredible great luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the untireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a need that was not covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">Business is very good for us.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there is also times, if not everything goes smooth.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have not allowed parties to be celebrated or rented apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts will have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked on the customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front front, when he was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. already woe when I think it only.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that listens in the voice of the recruitment, it was also always our greatest motivation to further improve us.</seg>
<seg id="208">Luckily, the 123 million people had only a fraction with a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trusted right to one another.</seg>
<seg id="210">If confidence works, will be able to emerge himself.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made vacation in Uruguay and he suffered a heart attack there.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host went to hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even got blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travellers who tend to heart attack due to seat activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real Guardian angel who save lives, although they don't know one at all.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car in the hospital when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want to feel lonely, they bring books on it.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer, without charge the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So, of course, does not run any stay.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to reach in the share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I looked for the first time about this term, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of writing with money transactions together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is about a economic business here.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but it just is just" "" "rental industry" "", "it is not just the case." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People lay a part of itself, and this changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you travel today, it is easy to compare with Fast Food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What if travelling would be a rich buffet from local income?</seg>
<seg id="232">What would be, if you're visiting to wait a group there, a group there would be thoroughly replenish and to show one of a cubs area of which you have never heard;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you cook a five-star cook?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to share flats from the ground?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What would be, if cities would have received the idea of a joint share?</seg>
<seg id="238">I present the cities that allow us to reach society and relationships, instead of loneliness and firing.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korean capital Seoul, this project was begun. many parking spaces, which belonged to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">All residents were offered now. students who were looking for a stay in search of a lead,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were conveyed in humans whose children were finished. Incubation programmes were launched,</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in the share economy. over our platform alone, 785 000 people in 191 countries are participating in a stranger or self-host.</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea seems to be so crazy about how it was brought to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We are not reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality has already existed before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were already similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did it just work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from luck and timing we realized that you can find the right design of the confidence of confidence in confidence.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us to overcome deep roots.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find it blossom,</seg>
<seg id="251">It was overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it when a red Mazda has gone to me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We naturally know that design can not solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us if it had great influence, I ask myself what we can proceed for soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks. thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think, if you see me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? a expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, a brain underwear, a terrorist act?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or just a delay in security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the guilt for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media is present so look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of coverage regarding Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: Americans mine, most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Presumably the people do not speak with their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For all those who have never met a Muslim: it is great, you know knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="268">I say to you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee-operated - double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am noted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A sealegern fitness fanatics,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim min.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not how Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born so.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to have it.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17, I met the decision to ouw me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual man, like some of my friends, but as the Muslim. I decided to bear Hijab, my head covering.</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist friends were horrified: "why do you sing yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">The Lustrade was: at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence, as compared to the pressure that I felt as a 17-year-old, will adapt to a perfect and unachievable beauty deal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only adopted passively to the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have wrestling with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought, asked in question, doubted and believed.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship to God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">She was confidence and long devotion to deepen the cording with each reading of the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of rhythms bring me sometimes to weeping.</seg>
<seg id="285">I know it myself. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Did you ever feel that someone does not know you understand completely, and yet somehow I love?</seg>
<seg id="287">So it feels like that.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I married and began as all of the good Egyptians, my career as engineers.</seg>
<seg id="289">I later, after my marriage, a child, and lived basically the "Egyptian-American Dream."</seg>
<seg id="290">Then the terrible morning came in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast at the end, looked on screen and saw the word "Eileen."</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, aircrafts caught in buildings, people spread out of the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was it?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock related quickly in indignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should I do so?</seg>
<seg id="299">"" "I changed the television channel and heard:" ""... "Muslim terrorists..." ""... "... in the name of Islam..." ""... "Jihadists..." ""... "" ""... "" ""</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh, my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It is not only my country attacked, but in Nu related me the acts of others from one citizen to a suspects.</seg>
<seg id="302">The same day we had to go through the Middle East of the USA to go into a new city and start postgraduate course.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember, as we were silent -- as we were silent -- as low it went to my seat, and I feared the first time as the Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved to this night in our apartment, in a new town, in which it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">And when I heard, I looked, and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said, "Be careful," and lead me in well-illuminated area, "Consequences towards you."</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gathered to prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">And again, the warnings: "not on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were incomprehensible and I heard of attacks on Muslims or of people who stayed for Muslims who were torn in free.</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really Brandances on Mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something really felt right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because people who attacked this country have attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I got the rage of people to the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to explain so continuous themselves.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">There are the allegations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Today we can listen to people: "there is a problem in this country -- it means Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we go off? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to join Muslims and Mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church as from a tumor in the US.</seg>
<seg id="324">It's just the question: are we bad or gutted?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumor can be found as a whole and a non-malignant tumor one can only be under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are like all other Americans, no tumors in the body of the USA, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, sthelial and Olympionics.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of the mosques of America become a safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">There may be a few parking spaces, but not stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque leads to people with other faith tolerant, and greater civil participation to show.</seg>
<seg id="333">And like me, head of the police in the area of Washington, DC recently added: people will actually not be razed in Mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are razed in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">At the time of the radio process it has been found that it will begin online. as the creation, the person will not be taken away from their family, that the person who believes, the terrorists are the true Muslims, and everyone who abhors their behavior and their ideology is a betrayers or of the belief.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to avoid radicalization, we must stop the people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group of how the IS carries out its breeding with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a mother, I think we must do everything to stop a group as the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would put forward to their privileges when they acknowledge it as a representative of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux clan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology reasons on their "holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">But if you have a look at her, she does not drives what they do in their "Holy Scripture."</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brood-vitality, which they may read these things into the scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding imam told me a marvellous story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him, because they regard it to the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was surprised and asked him if she was in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said, the problem was exactly the opposite. everyone who had spoken it, brought them to silence, and told her, that their wrath, their sense of unrighteousness in the world, would only bring them into difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="350">Nothing inspired and something that have been given to her rage, she was a main goal for the instrumentalization by extremists who spoke to their solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam turned the link to God and their church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Rather than accused of having accuse for her groove, he demonstrated her constructive ways for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she met in the mosque, she kept it to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">That was an insight, like the Islamophobia me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it work on normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it work on any other?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear every day on our democracy?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually several neuroscience studies - show: if we fear, pass at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">We accept a authoritarian government system, conformity and supplies.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows: if you report reviews in which negative for Muslims, they voted for rather military attacks on Muslim countries and the circumcision of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look at when the mood rose up against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then it happened three times, but never in connection with terror attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the preparation of the war against Iraq and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So, Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction on Moslem terror, as I expected it.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool for manipulation to be public in order to undermining the foundation of a free society which has been sensible and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">To deal with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We perhaps feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear constraineth us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the assignment of collective schoold it does not only have to explain himself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple, who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was an athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was at the dental Faculty, talented, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would say to me that he was the sweet, most generous man, whom they knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her resume. she was truthed and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when is such a young man diversified from my breasts?"</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after visiting Suzanne during her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, she was murdered in the afternoon as the sister of Yusor, Razan who posted in the afternoon as he posted outside of Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He shot eight times on Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanatism can not only be bad, but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Are we gone to the mosque, we remained safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We had it and for us it was no easy decision to let America we want to leave our children: one that would control us through fear, or one where we can freely practise our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided to meet for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">We keep silent with our son in the children's seat, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, moved out my shoes, went into the building hall, and what I saw, let me hold.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was restless filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the beam made a announcement, thanked up and welcomed our guests, because half of the were gathered Christians, Jews, Buddhists, believers and non-believers who were come, not to attack us, but to stand for us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At this moment I have collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there, because they had the courage and reproaches of panic and preference.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose from the moment of anxiety and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Are you going to go on number?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join them, my: we are better than they.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you so much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you beautiful!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: therefore Dalia, you seem to have a nervous.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I ask myself, what say that you may say that you're a TEDTalk, a thinking with a draught that are going to work in a noble monument factory, thus an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say, I don't think. I'm totally normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I'm so usually as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">If you look to Muslims in the whole world, and I did that with the greatest ever conducted study to Muslims in the whole world, want people normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity for the family, they want to work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I have no exception in any respect.</seg>
<seg id="405">If people appear as a rule, then the rule is broken, and they are not the exception to rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What began as a platform for Basters, is short before.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. possible in research institutions worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before the air act has entered into our social consciousness, a autonomous fleet of aircraft machines at the Frac Centre in France live a six meter high tower from 1 500 bricks. some years ago she began to fly with arrows.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting connect, high speed and acceleration in the smallest space.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-loaded structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to bear loads, to deal with turbulence and to respond to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you a few of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of Possible flight in an autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">With that a system of autonom works, it must know collective guardian, where space is located in the space of the mobile objects.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zürich, we often use external cameras to find objects. that allows us to concentrate on rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos, we use a new localising technology from Verity Studios, a publisher of our laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors to determine position in the room, calculations on board determine what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands are available at the highest ge. g." "" "and" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flight that tries to strike two flying with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters, it is efficient, much more efficient than helicopters in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most of the starters, it can be hover, and has great benefits at start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">But there is always a sweat page.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear devices is that they react sensitively to turbulence such as wind turbines.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the airunit doesn't matter how the optimal position can be recovered and the performance through practice can be improved.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often ask for fundamental abstract questions related to the core of the cause.</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be for example: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for this to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known about machines with a thousand moving parts that are met to violate you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Two pilots were able to fly remote control units, which had only two mobile parts: one propeller and one stern thruder.</seg>
<seg id="435">We discovered that flies with only one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the Monospinner, the mechanical and simple remote control unit. it was recently invented.</seg>
<seg id="437">It only has an eventful part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No flaps, hinges and transverse plates, no further actuator or control surfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it's mechanically simple, the inner life happens very much, that it can fly stable and can easily move in space.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear. to bring it to flies, I have to throw it exactly.</seg>
<seg id="441">The likelihood to throw exactly correctly, if all is shown, is small, therefore I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">When the Monospinner is a exercise in Genüamity, this machine is here, the Omnicopter with its eight propellers, a exercise in excess.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this flow?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">As a result he receives the closest ordinary ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">In space to move in all directions, no matter how it is directed, or even as it rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">A lot is possible in models, the rest is learns directly to fly.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine here consists of two separate two-propellers engines.</seg>
<seg id="453">The rotates in clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against counterclockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you assemble them, they are like a high-intensity Quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">However, something wrong - a motor or propellers falls off, the electronics or a battery -- can also fly further when restricted.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will therefore demonstrate that we make a half airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examined synthetic barriers.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units enables a pallet on aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We used commercially available Micro quadcopter -- every single weighs less than a disc bread -- and outfit them with local technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where space is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">We hopefully motivating this demonstrations to reconsider new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The especially secure machine da drummy would like to become a flying lamp screen on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us the salary is in development and the work act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder, how beautiful and magical our universe is, and that it allows the creative, clever shines allowed to form them in a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive industrial and economic potential, is the dot of the dot on the i.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you so much.</seg>
<seg id="469">In front of 1.3 billion years ago, two black holes in a very far away galaxy is much faster, they walked so the mass of three suns in a tenth of a tenth in pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment worked brighter than all stars together in all the galaxies of the entire universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big Knuine.</seg>
<seg id="472">They didn't use their energy in the form of light.</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was given into space-time progressing and the universe exploded into gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">We first arrange the events in time.</seg>
<seg id="476">In front of 1.3 billion years ago, he was only surround life on earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the earth has emerged: corals, fish, plants, saurier, people, and -- God stand us with -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group of particularly mug -- Rai Weiss from MIT, KIP Thorne and Ronald Drever of the Caltech -- a giant laser detector to search for gravitational waves created by colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most held them for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognised it as a mad genius, so that the U.S. National Science Foundation financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, conception and extremely much hard work they built the detector LIGO: the Laser Interferometry Gravitational Observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the follow-up time, the precision of LIGO increased significantly, which greatly improved the detection performance.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore you are called Advanced LIGO now.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015 LIGO was launched for a final test run by some smaller, persistent problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On 14 September 2015, only a few days after the start of the detector, the gravitational waves propelled the two colliding black holes through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: just two moments in my life were emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The Birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the goodbye to my todill father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically they were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All this, what I had worked, is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist on the MIT since 23 years and its endvitational signals like LIGO measuring signals. what are gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is an forces in the encoder of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When moving the shaft, the space and its entire content will be stretched into one direction and spread into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">In relation to illustrative dozers in Kursen, theory of theory often often have a correct dancing dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dust, stretching and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On the 14th of September, for example, each one of us was stretched out and disturbed by us. the elongation of an average people was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That means 20 nulls according to the commma, followed by a 1. therefore we declared the LIGO people for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometre laser detector, and this is absurd, this length would have to be measured at less than a thousandths of a radius of a nuclear power. that is grotesk.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of its classical text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">Described KIP Thorne, a co-founder LIGOs, the hunt for the waves like this: "the technical difficulties when construction of such detectors are mighty.</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicists are invarized and with the support of the public will be overcome all obstacles. "</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne released this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to LIGO. Scott claims that LIGO may be more an ear than one eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than the things about us: facials, the size of your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="508">That's quite practical. for so you can easily get a picture or a map of things by taking out that of several points coming around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">With tones this is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">Therefore it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that are particularly important:</seg>
<seg id="512">About the face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead, we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and height, rhythm and volume to close the story behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"now Alice says Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob leaves her."</seg>
<seg id="516">"Dept Bob".</seg>
<seg id="517">The same is true for gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can't produce any simple pictures of objects in all.</seg>
<seg id="519">But having regard to changes in amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to us their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least the measured frequencies are measured in the audible range for LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="521">So when we convert wave pattern in sound, we can hear the all literally.</seg>
<seg id="522">The engravitation too noises can us betray us about the collision of two black holes with which my colleague Scott has already worked very long.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, not rotating holes, circulation: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turn the two bodies very fast, you hear the same circulation with an additional sound exchange. that sounds like this: wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of motion set, shaped into the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a Date, which at least I never forget -- heard LIGO the following: [Surrender [sound] Jenny, who knows what he must hear, recognize this as sound: 30 times the sun mass, that turns around as fast as the bars of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: superior to us what that meant.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in all, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 cuns, revolve one hundred times a second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine this forces before.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know of it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">There is the permanent meaning of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">LIGO is a completely new way to explore the universe as they never had previously been possible.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the All and the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Many in all, we can't see - practically or in principle -- not possible.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why masserie stars explode in Supernovae.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. of them we have learned a lot about that.</seg>
<seg id="538">The thrilling physical events occur in the core, which is behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon hidden.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see, since these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves are penetrating iron, as it would be transparent glass. the Urgnall: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it because the jungle is covered by his own neighbor.</seg>
<seg id="541">Using gravitational waves, it should be possible to relook back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I'm optimistic about that in all things we have never seen that we never see, and from which we don't have any idea. things we only discover, we hear that we hear.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact LIGO was in the first start of all things that we had not expected.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says to this topic: me: the type of stars that produce black holes are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient body from prehistoric times. the black holes are so to speak the Saurierknoche for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">LIGO allows us to introduce a completely different angles on the events of all, on the creation of the stars and ultimately to make it out of this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is now to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to LIGO we know how to listen a great Detectors and listen to the noise and circulation of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatory -- a brand new generation of observatory on earth and in all.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than the urinary yourself?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now the time is great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dreams with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thanks. thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "one year I would say" "" "Yes!" "" "I was afraid because of whom I feared." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter whether it made me nervous, me in unpleasant situations, I forced me to say "Yes".</seg>

<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new life setting in my family. from there I swears to me, always with them once you want to call me. no matter what I'm doing, or where I go, I say always yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I tired me very much.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, on my children, on our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has a tricky tribution: only recently, I was completely understood that the "Yes" Say on playing with my children my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>

<seg id="581">No. no.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create television. I beaccompanies TV.</seg>
<seg id="585">I do TVs, in large style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV-season, I am responsible for the saving of 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are in production simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each broadcast has hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV station can lie between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">We say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode all nine days ago, four television programmes, four television programmes, 70 hours TV, three programmes, which are at the same time in production, time four, 16 episodes: Scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Living, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America, my TV series continued on Thursday night.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is globally, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broadcasts that I have created itself, and not only produced, so still obsolete. I have time to find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four television series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires that burning around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who still does that?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, why am I a Titan.</seg>

<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you.</seg>

<seg id="602">I tell you that all of you who work as hard to whether you're now a company, a country or a classroom, allowing me to understand that I do not only say on the computer and fantasiere, and it's right if I say: I understand that there is not a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It is all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, everything sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work much, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">If I'm deeper into working, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work creates always a land from the nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is, when I set up troops when I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">So as dreds a high sound, lieve a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">It feels like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanically, strentive and intoxicating, funny and mutually, clinically and rational, cruel, and rational, and the best thing is that the Summary is.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is so a change in me when work is well done.</seg>
<seg id="614">A buzz begins in my head, and it grows and growing, and the buzz hears as a busy street, I could go for ever on it.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people assume, if I explain to them the sums that I talk to it, that the writing has been prepared for me.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, that does it.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the sums -- when I started working with television production, when I began working and to work and to work, I discovered this thing, this sums, this energy.</seg>
<seg id="618">The buzz is more than that writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The buzz is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The buzz is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have a sums, then you can not strive any other than size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling, not unlike the size, regardless of size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is how you call the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it means a workflow.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it is called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is called Ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it's fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I only know that I'm not for failure, and I only know that I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to say to you, I am a titanium, and I know that I don't want it to question.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make a clear: ever more shows, more episodes, the more about the time, the more work, the more things the time, the more about me, the more do I write history, the more more expectations exist.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more you have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what do I do about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land that I create, the marathon, whom I run, the army, the high clay, the sums, the sums, the sums.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I'm the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only that sums?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, overtaken, exaggerated, dragged.</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are reconciled to the truth that their mom is a single working title.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper told people: "my mom will not be there, but you can write to my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "and Emerson says:" "" "they will go to Shonda land." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">They are the children of a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are Baby-Titanen.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="650">I loved my work no more. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums came not back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as always: the same titanium-work, 15 hours-day, continuous week, no Reue, nothing delegate, does not sleep, with all your heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a show-showing-Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was gray, I just had no fun.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">All that I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sums and the sums I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do if things are doing, the work that you love, suddenly causes me?</seg>
<seg id="665">I know, some may think: "Heul you from, stupid man's author."</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know you're doing, you're doing what you do is one teacher, a painter, bill Gates, one who knows how to feel the sums, and knows how to stop the sums when the sums stop when the sums stop, who is one then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a titanium?</seg>
<seg id="670">If the song of my heart heareth, I can survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">"" "and then my" "" "south states' cellars" "". "a question." ""</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I am on the way to the outside, too late and she says:" "" "Mama, you're playing?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I will tell no, when two things are aware of:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I have to say Yes to anything and second, she called me not "Evaluate."</seg>
<seg id="675">They call no more "Evaluate."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it, if I'm titanium and my sums, and here everything change my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">And so she says: "mom, do you play?"</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say: "yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">It is nothing special about it.</seg>
<seg id="681">"" "we play and play their sisters, we laugh at much and I read completely dramatic from the book" "" "Everybody Poops" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in the loneliness and in the absence of the summing, I can do nothing but can fit.</seg>
<seg id="684">I'm focusing on.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The land that I create, the marathon, whom I run, the army, the high sound - they do no more.</seg>
<seg id="687">Everything that exists sticky fingers and moist kisses, tender voices, juniper pins and the song, in which it's a lot, or whatever is the girl in "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so short that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I am.</seg>
<seg id="691">Play is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I'm happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">An mental door goes on and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that is not immediately, but it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums come back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it is quiet, barely audible, but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sums, but a sums.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel that I would know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let us remain with the cause.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It's something that we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The buzz, the work table, the titanium umms, that is only the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you, if I tell you, who am I, if I cast me out using broadcasts and TV hours and how working my brain is, then I forgot what the real sums is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums is no strength and it is not labour-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It is dependent on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sums depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The buzz is the river which comes from the life of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums is self-conscious and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real sums ignores the pressure of history, to do the tasks, anticipation and pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real sums is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps whispered to God the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a titanium?</seg>
<seg id="715">It just is love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">Once my child I want to play with me I will tell Yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I'm doing this for a fixed rule, so I can deliver me as a workflow for every fault.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is a law, I have no other option. I don't have any choice, if I want to hear the sums again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Play for me not as a full way, how to work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth does woe,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work, because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I am more than at the workplace as at home.</seg>

<seg id="731">We got around in the garden, back and back.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We crushed soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel mostly stiffles, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always mature after my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how you live, and the sums of the universe met me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play, until I ask myself: why did we play with the games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! if your child would like to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Perhaps you will keep me for naiv, for an instructor.</seg>
<seg id="742">There is well right, but you can do it too!</seg>

<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones would like to play with me most 15 minutes with me until they try something else.</seg>

<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" it is short for everything I got up when I got my first TV show when I got a titanium in training when I got myself more and more.</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes on the piece, why do not get rid of 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The buzz came back in my leisure time. the sums seems to return, if I don't work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without any games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months, a door opens, and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it satisfies me and my soul. she refuses me to new ideas. I use it in full breeding and love my work again.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the buzz, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I'm not the sums, the sums is not I... no more.</seg>

<seg id="778">I'm sorry that I am a titanium. I've never seen a titanium, the trip to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything in the handle. my brain is still working. my bonfire is still burning.</seg>

<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the sums. the land that I create, the marathon, whom I run, the troops, the high sound, the sums, the sums, the sums, the sum of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this sums, the more makes this unusual, beaculate, naked and new life feeling in me wide. less Titan -- more I!</seg>

<seg id="790">This is the dream of this jobs,</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dream job should be a little dreams.</seg>

<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you very nice.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="797">As most of my colleagues I have to do with human tragedy every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after a heavy stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us Neurosurgeon it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organic, has a very low ability to help self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a severe injury of the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, heavy disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I was working in neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional Neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nervous functions through various surgical action.</seg>
<seg id="804">Certainly they have heard of one of the most well-known, the "deep cerebstimulation." it implanted a electrode deep in the brain in order to influence the circuits of neurons so that the neurological function enhances itself.</seg>
<seg id="805">It is really an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson, who suffered severe citations and heavy pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">However Neuromodulation does not mean Neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgery is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">My opinion, we are looking forward to this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I want to show you that we are very close to you.</seg>
<seg id="810">Help the brain help yourself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story started 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was conductive public doctor and working day and night in the emergency capacity.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often supplied patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You need to imagine that for cranks-brain traumata brain, the brain relapt and the cranial pressure is rising.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life, you have to reduce the cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">You have to remove one part of the swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Rather than toss the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyze with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain compound.</seg>
<seg id="818">What can I do with it?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is no light task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Cells from a piece of tissue, is comparable to all small children who are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You need to find the right diet, temperature, moisture and environments to thrive them.</seg>
<seg id="823">Exactly that we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts it was managed by Jean François-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">This he saw under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with great green cells that are surrounded by small, unmature cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you can still know from the biographical lessons that stem cells are unripe, that can transform itself into every cell type of organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niche of brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to receive this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain compound in surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made a further fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells were different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They were slowly and after a few weeks she died even.</seg>
<seg id="836">Thus, we saw a new, weird cellular population which looked like the stem cells, but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they arrived.</seg>
<seg id="838">They originate from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublectic in positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our cerebral cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the fetus they provide for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they get to us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they take part in the healing of the brain since we find it in higher concentrations close to brain injury.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so safe.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is however clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand in front of a potential cell source which enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brain compound in the non-linguistic area and then the cells exactly are cultivated as it did Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="853">And they then have colored colour to trace them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step, we implanted them at the decision of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologist Transplantation -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we implanted these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we implanted the same cells in foothed brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with apes.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario, we implanted the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that they had taken away after some weeks, they go back home. the room is already occupied, they are not used there, so they vanish it.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario, we attached a violation and implanted the same cells, and now the cells remain -- it grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could watch under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were implanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence that they show, these small points are these small points. these are the cells that we painted in vitro.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we could not stop.</seg>
<seg id="864">Help these cells also a wise monkeys to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained no monkey with a manual skill problem.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They did very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">As they achieved a stabilized skill level, we used the motor-motor Cortex in motor Cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">Then the monkeys were paralysed, they couldn't move their hand.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen to people, they recovered spontaneously to a certain degree, exactly as after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralyzed and then try to recover from the plastic brain mechanisms. they recover a certain degree, just as the wise monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left side you see the monkey, who recovered spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can bring about 40% to 50% of its original power from injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now, when we implanted the cells, the same monkey, two months after mimplantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we found out much more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can use them to freeze and later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use it in other neuropathological models, for example with Parkinson.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implant them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can soon show you how the human brain gives the means to heal themselves.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you so much.</seg>
<seg id="884">"" "Bruno Giussani:" "" "Jocelyne, this is wonderful, I'm sure now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think:" "" "I know someone who need this." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely want.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the largest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials in humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the greatest obstacles are the authorities. based on this great results you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this kind of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: it is understandable, the brain is very delicate etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and a professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to the start of clinical trials. if you continue to see in the future, as many years it takes, until somebody can come to hospital, and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First it depends on the approval of clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authority allow us to start soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select the patient to perform treatments and assess whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply it to a multicentre study.</seg>
<seg id="897">You must first prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment each.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that's sure, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you so much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">In the West we make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We see the democracy not as fragile plant that is in reality, but as the Inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider it as a non-altered.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing have said that it is possible to have a blooming capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely indisputable.</seg>
<seg id="908">Indeed, democracy is disseminated with us in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was declared unambiguous by the finance minister in the Eurogroup -- our elections -- not affect the savings programs which have been realised in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At this moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuon Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my beloved friends who would repeat me when it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce a economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I pray you, together with me, again to believe that Lee Kuon Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of wrong believe we could save the democracy, but that we need a true and defentive democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">Because without democracy our companies are producing, our future jets and our great, new technologies are wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">For the issue of waste, I would like to point to an interesting contradiction which is currently threatening our host.</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twin peaks" Paradox. "</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. they know and recognize him as the Debt mountain, who throws his long shade about the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the Schuldenberg,</seg>
<seg id="918">Yet only few recognize his Didymus.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which belongs to the asible savings and corporations, however, to invest where it would be productive and income could produce and even all the things that humanity urgently needed, for example "green" energy. "</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months, in the US, in England and in the Eurozone, 3.4 trillion US dollars have been invested in all the wealth of producing goods, such as industrial facilities, machinery, office buildings, schools, streets, tracks, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">In a lot of money, the 3.4 trillion US dollars is compared to a lot of money, compared to the same time in the same time and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing did, except the stock exams and the property prices are overthrown.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus, debt and unproductive capital will not form the twin peaks that cannot be compensated by the usual market mechanisms of market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result are stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-old in the US, Japan and Europe, and therefore a low overall economic demand, which could not promote themselves in which they do not invest. just like Ödipus Father, who would not invest in mind that his son would kill him if he is growing,</seg>
<seg id="925">Unrolled the circumstances that lead to it that Ödipus kill him kills him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my Hades with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">Its extremely refined capital art. all the unproductive capital should be used to further improve the human talents and to finance particular all the technologies, "green" technologies which are crucial for the salvation of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">Is it democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I think so. but before we continue: what do we understand under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as the social form, in which the free and the poor serves as a majority to control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenical Democracy finally concluded too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and natural slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">It would be an error, the value of Athenian democracy due to these inclusions.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decision on the Athenic democracy was and that they gave not only the right to free expression, and not only the right to free expression of opinion, but importantly, they agree to them the right to political participation in questions of the State stick.</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy has not kept long --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that illuminates very bright, it is also rapidly spread.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our present liberals democracies did not have their roots in the ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy focused on the free citizens, our liberal democracy is based on the Magna Carta, which ultimately proved an ordinance for ruling.</seg>
<seg id="940">For the liberal democracy occurred only when a complete separation from politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was entered into politics, while the economy -- thus the world of the concert -- a democraratiefree zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our present democracies, since the time that this separation from politics and economy began, an unerbated struggle between the two, by the economy hives the policy gradually and mastered it.</seg>
<seg id="942">Are you wondering why the politicians isn't like so earlier?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not in a degeneration of its DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It lies in mind that it can be in the government today and still not at power because the power of politics is abhorred in the economy and separated the areas.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my Hades with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is like a herd of pirates, which is so sustainably the animals of which they feed themselves, that they are hungry at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, with the economy that has caused politics as far as far, it grows through the self-caused economic crisis itself. the power of the corporations growing, political goods, the overall economic situation is rising and the general manager of the corporations are to invest, the cash of their company will invest.</seg>
<seg id="948">Ever on the success of capitalism, "demos" [the people] from democracy, the higher will become the twin peaks, and the more the waste of human workers and the wellbeing of mankind.</seg>
<seg id="949">If that is true, it is obvious that we must bring the politics and the economy, and it would be better if the "demos" control reserves, as in the ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist Linke had the idea 100 years ago and it didn't be especially strange.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine of the deacity of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only regained a position as in the ancient Athens, without creating new species of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: to put the poor poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by being replaced low wages by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is that long economy and politics are separate areas, automation can become higher, the automation of twins higher, and the social conflicts are deeper, as it is already very soon as I think -- in countries like China will come.</seg>
<seg id="956">So we have to combine the economy and unite the areas of economy and politics, and make sure that we need the reunified area, otherwise we end the film "Matrix" as a documentation.</seg>
<seg id="957">So the question is not whether the capitalism is the technical achievements, which he has brought forth, will survive --</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is like a Dystopie, similar to that in "Star Trek," it is similar to humans and helping people to serve their energy into the exploring of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the Ancient Athenian "Agora" in long talks with the sense of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we may be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it look like it could look like this "star Trek" -like Utopia instead of the "matrix" like similar Dystopie?</seg>
<seg id="961">In the practical implementation I would like to give you some examples in all brief, some examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the field of companies: please make a capital market that allows you to earn money, while you are working with your capital to the next, from one company to the next, and the company -- no matter what you're currently working -- is the property of those working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">"" "" "" "then comes all income from capital and dissolving and the concept of labour work is completely overhauled." ""</seg>
<seg id="964">No differentiation between those who belong to companies which are not working there, but employees working there, to whom the company does not belong to the company, but no great gaps between investment and coils, and ultimately cannot be taken up to the twin peaks.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economy, please make sure that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which will be issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interests of all mankind will be issued.</seg>
<seg id="966">"" "imagine that the whole world trade will be traded in this currency --" "" "we call it" "" "Kosmos" "" "in units of" "" "Kosmos" "" "and every government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trading income of the country to a common fund." ""</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund has invested in "green" technologies, particularly in parts of the world, in which investment funds are rar.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that you didn't plan to implement the technical resources at that time.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today we have, in particular, especially in the background of a recovered policy and business.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world that I drove you, is becoming more liberal, in which they preferred privileged individuals and marxistic because they will have buried the separation of capital and work in the trash of history, and keynesian, globally keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all others it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Are we awakening in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or are we going to drop into a "matrix" - similar Dystopie?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide on it politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we do it better.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks. thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You gave yourself a liberal Marxists in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I said just is relevant, Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for reunification of politics and economy... do not do this, technological development will produce a massive decline in overall demand, as Larry Summers referred to as a long-term stagnation. "</seg>
<seg id="984">Through the transfer of this crisis from a part of the earth to the next, as we are currently experiencing it, it will not only be able to destabilize our democratic, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is small.</seg>
<seg id="985">When this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Likewise, as Hayek, therefore I am a liberal Marxist, and how Keynes, and therefore I am entirely restarted.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are too.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you don't work, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a sort of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein, who said that. BG: in your lecture, you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of Redner you have said very clearly, what you keep from the view of the West to China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Do you want to repeat this here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a large degree of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracy we have the licence of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy on politics, while the area where most of the economy replay, -- the area of the economy -- a completely democrayefree zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a certain way, if I may say the so provocative, China is similar to the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">Because -- remember -- We tend to connect liberalism to democracy -- that is an error, historical viewed.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, such as John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was especially skeptical, affecting the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What can be seen now in China, resembles the development which we had in England during the industrial revolution, particularly the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China now aim to do that which the West has done in the 19th century, crawells amazing according to hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I'm sure that many listeners experienced to your experiences as finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I guess that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back for six months later on the first half?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from personal view, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">Namely, from the self-flowance to say goodbye, and permanently denying that a massive rejection line went out through the euro zone, and continues to massively the development of the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity to agree on the Greek demonstrations -- by the way, the first proposal to denying these denies --</seg>
<seg id="1008">Unfortunately it is right to do. unfortunately, the powers have chosen within the Eurozone, within the European Group, continues to denies.</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If one tries to receive an economic system that is not overpowered by political will and authitarism, it might be quite a while, but if the shift occurs, he abruptly abruptly and destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what change do you see?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone does not have any future if we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your business as a finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back - harvesters...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a finance minister, or any ministers after 6 months in office, particularly in a stressed situation, claims that he did not make any mistakes, then it is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The greatest error was to sign the application for the extension of the school program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was a honest interest on pages of the money, to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not there.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They merely wanted to fall our government only because they don't want to deal with the Versions that ran through the euro area.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't want to stand out that they had a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">There is worse than the Great Depression. "</seg>
<seg id="1026">None of the Troika of the Troika, who gave us this policy, stressed: "that was a colossal mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all these, and despite the aggressive tone of talks, you seem to be quite a pro-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My criticism of the European Union and the euro zone opposite to someone who lives and loves Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1030">My biggest fear is that the Eurozone did not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">For if they were not survives, the released Fliehead Dämonisch and the European Union shall destroy.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This will not have catastrophic consequences for Europe alone, but for the entire world economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we propose to propose the way of a post-modern 1930, then it appears to be as well as the future of Europeans as well as the non-Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you are wrong in this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you that you were at TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">Apart from Roy Price, most of them never heard although it is likely to be responsible for 22 medium minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very enjoyable minutes, but not for many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision, the Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a senior employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slim, has a Igelfrisur and describes on Twitter as "Movies, TV, Technology, Tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job, because he is responsible for the shows and contents of the Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a very hard fighting industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are already so many TV shows that Roy cannot select anywhere.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He must show shows that are very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows that are on the right at that turn.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation division of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the evaluation goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows are obtained.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is valued at nine and above, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like "Breaking Bad", "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that are addictive after one of the season, your brain asks: "where is there any more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left, here at this end shows shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- that should tell you enough what goes to that at the end of the turn.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not take away because of the left side of the turn, because I think it takes special intelligence, to "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes himself more thoughts about the middle exulance, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they just inspire them.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must ensure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present and of course it is the first time that Amazon is something like that, Roy Price wants to risk nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he holds a contest.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes up many ideas for TV shows and chosen by an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and will show them online, where they can view each one for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if an Amazon is free of vain, you feel right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators watching these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they do not know that they are observed at the view of these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are observed by Roy and his team that record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">When you start the show, when you pauses, which parts can be overseen or again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide with these data then decide what show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">Indeed, collect the data, process and this is the answer, and this is: "Amazon should make a SitCom over four Republican US transformers."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "alpha House," but it seems that no many of these show can remember because it was not so good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It is only an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- since the average of these curve is 7.4 and Alpha House landet at 7.5 -- thus somewhat above average, but not just that which Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About the same time with another company, another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. its name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming of Netflix. just like Roy he is always looking for finding this one super-show and it also uses data for it, but he makes it something different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of a contest, he and his team listened to the existing data on the Netflix viewer, so the reviews they give the shows their course, what shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then use this data to find these small details about the audience: what shows they like those manufacturers, what actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together they entered a car, and decided to make no sitCom over four transformers, but a drama series about a Senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards". Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly there where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course is the question: what is happening here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">It has two very competent, data diversified companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They combine these many data and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic indicates that it should work in all.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you gathers millions of data for a decision to meet you, then you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">One has 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized through very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least what you can expect is good TV, or?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work, then it's somewhat terrifying because we live in a time in which we want more and more to statistics to meet serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health System?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health system is a software company and I hope that no one in this room ever comes into contact with this software. come in touch, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If anyone asks here in the US in prison and to release, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine if an office is made or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like at Amazon and Netflix. but rather than decide whether a show is good or bad, it is decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Medium television, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that these data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are generated. this is not sure that a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data diversified firms are wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google makes no error.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009 Google announced that they can predict upoutbreaks of influenza, which can predict any way through data analysis of Google research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news. the success culminated in a publication in the journal Nature. "</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked just fine, year around year, until there was no longer working,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It was simply not working, this was again a sensation, including the publication of the publication in the journal Nature. "</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data are experienced, such as Amazon and Google are sometimes imaging.</seg>
<seg id="1106">In spite of all these bugs, data streams into decisions of life -- at the workplace, on the right of law, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather ensure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in the computer-based genetics -- an area where some very wise men can use unimaginable many data to meet serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I detected some samples of the difference between successful decisions using the data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">Do you need to solve a complex problem, do mostly two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">As a mark you will put this problem in its components, so that you can analyze the individual components; as a second time you set the individual components again to deal with a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to disassemble and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to put the parts again and then to come to an end.</seg>
<seg id="1116">For this there is another tool and we all have: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something that the brain is good, it is parts and pieces again together, even if the information is incomplete, to deal with a good decision -- especially when the brain is an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I think, was Netflix so successful because they have used data and understanding, where they also belong to the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They utilize data to understand their audience, what else they would have been able to have. but the decision to set up all these parts, and make it a show like "House of Cards" which does not stand in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that they entered a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">On the other hand, on the other hand, on the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used to control all their decisions, first in order to contest TV ideas, then as they chose "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a secure decision because they always could say: "they say the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better choices, but I think things do not run when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are only a tool, and to forget that, this device is rather useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will be...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there were data, it was the tool for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball." it is amazing. for decisions by a Ja- or no-question you have to shake the ball to get an answer. "highly likely" -- exactly here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will see it later with a technique demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far I met some of the decisions in my life, where I should have listened to the ball.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them with a little bit fences, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But that does not change the basic body.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So, perhaps the ball valve and smart. finally, it is to meet us to meet decisions when we want to reach something unusual at the end of the right turn.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I'm sensitive to this as very encouraging news that it is still missing in spite of the great amount of data, making decisions to be an expert in what you do, and to enter risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because at the end, it is not the data, but the risks of which you land at the right end of the turn.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very nice.</seg>
