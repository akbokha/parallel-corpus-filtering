Munich , 1856 : four cards that change your view to the city
a mistaken operation , where people are supposed to face to the young people .
a message chapel , where the tunnel is dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ ers econom@@ ies the unique reason of pe@@ as@@ ants .
the oldest official card of Mün@@ ker supports exciting stories about days .
it is nerv@@ ous when land cards are not current .
this knows anyone who had to go exc@@ itement , because the Auto @-@ Nav@@ i took place instead of a stra@@ dd@@ ling street with a green meadow .
the historical maps of the digital Bayern At@@ l@@ ases , an offer of the ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as in Bavaria , the state government , are all other than currently , but is therefore extremely complex .
especially when you compare it with current online maps .
it is clear how cities and municipalities in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Merk@@ ur have changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern Atlas is a tap@@ est@@ ry carpet , which is not the same as such .
in the vast survey card for cities and municipalities in more detailed maps , so @-@ called ur@@ anium leaves .
these were developed according to the Bavarian State Building Administration between 1810 and 1864 and jump to the first survey@@ ing of Bavaria .
your clients : Napoleon .
in the spring of 1800 the French army officers occupied Bavaria since the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic recording of Bavaria in order - of course for military purposes .
finally , when the French troops finally ab@@ sent from Lun@@ é@@ ville of February 9 , 1801 , it was the present neigh@@ bors who created the idea of an area @-@ deck@@ ed Bavaria card .
Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV . Joseph drove the project ahead , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bavarian government management .
the Bavarian State Gazette for Munich dates back to 1856 and is how to find all others on the Bavarian State Library &apos;s website .
the comparison of early he / today is the national capital of the most impressive .
the city has expanded into all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is sub@@ sen@@ d@@ ling that is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856 .
ship@@ ling was used 21 years after the map of the map , i.e. 1877 , is meant as a Munich district .
today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is situated in the middle of the city .
the houses were concentrated around 1856 along the current Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ er , a leader of the Bavarian farmers in Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the West park is , you can see nothing as fields - at first glance : when en@@ zo@@ oming a smaller card with dozens lines and numbers : handwritten notes from the so @-@ called &quot; Ur@@ absorption &quot; from which the property tax was derived .
little pitches are present there today no farmers - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; Land in Sun . &quot;
a large green area is situated north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
the Theres@@ ien@@ wi@@ ese , in the 19th century , Theres@@ ien@@ wi@@ ese , had actually a meadow - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the prototype of the present district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one read only the road names , &quot; or from the An@@ h@@ ight &quot; on the fan &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; er@@ r old ones . &quot;
yes , here on the exhibition street there once un@@ locked people with mad@@ ness .
there was in 1858 / 59 the Munich circle @-@ Irish prison &quot; On the Au@@ er fan . &quot;
in 1872 , Dr. Bernhard headed the establishment of the establishment of the psychiat@@ rist who was brought to the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was advanced for his time and finished for example the c@@ rat@@ ers of the so called mistaken . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he taught the staff to apply violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has worked for an exhibition with the An@@ st@@ alt .
for 280 patients was first place , later was extended to 500 seats .
sometime , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the foundation for the construction of the circul@@ atory plant in hair 1905 .
the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost is one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ rist in Germany since 2006 .
the territory of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt participated in the Munich Sal@@ es@@ ian@@ um in the area of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 , and turned him to a youth shop with training .
West is the football field of the TS@@ V Munich East , east of the village of the 1980s .
in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was built in an architectural based on the country of origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ prison , which was destroyed during WW@@ II during the Second World War .
the Marien@@ platz was held in 1856 as &quot; head place , &quot; the shopping street called &quot; Kauf@@ inger alley . &quot;
a decisive change brought the Second World War in the heart of Munich .
the bom@@ bers of the Al@@ lies were pulled up a lot of holes in the city centre in December 1944 .
a great remained until today - at the Marien@@ hof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a greeting @-@ chapel from the Middle Ages were once at the Marien@@ hof , where these days were working , and on 5 April 2017 , the ground@@ breaking ceremony will take place for the second S @-@ Bahn main track .
with the sli@@ der , the old Munich @-@ map can be compared with the aerial photo of today and fill up the hole at the Marien@@ hof .
civil Group published a rice idea for Missouri
the National Union for the promotion of colored colored has issued a warning for colored people who travel to Missouri due to discrimin@@ ating policy and ra@@ cial attacks .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory Board for the State of Missouri , which to come into force by August 28 , 2017 , invites us to bring special attention to the state of particular attention , as a series of frag@@ ile , road @-@ based inci@@ dents in the last time and will be noted , &quot; says it in the opinion of the Group .
a recent law of Missouri , which makes people heavy to gain discrimination , as well as the prosec@@ ut@@ en@@ forcement agencies of the state who target disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ately on min@@ orities , the group , the NA@@ AC@@ P , said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; they have violations of the civil rights that people pass .
they are killed because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of the Missouri NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , Kansas City Star .
&quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard . &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the US .
the group cited events such as rac@@ ist strug@@ gles against black students at the University of Missouri and death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .
S@@ anders died in frag@@ ile circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no gasoline in custody during the journey , and by the police of Missouri , without any crime .
the Council also refers to a recent report by the Office of the General Prosecutor of Missouri , which is shown that black drive in the state will be 75 percent more frequently than the White .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware , and their families , friends and employees inform about what could happen in Missouri , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be willing to bring their money , or the relatives have to know that they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I recorded 100 hate in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FB@@ I , the FB@@ I , the state in regard to the number of such injuries in the 16th place of the country .
the rice @-@ arm@@ ament is an answer to a new Missouri law , which it would become more difficult to acc@@ use a company for residential or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had issued travel agencies for Texas and Arizona , after the States immig@@ ration authorities to under@@ take people because of immig@@ ration , which will contribute to the AC@@ L@@ U to further rein@@ forces .
Reis@@ ew@@ ar@@ ities are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but in the last time stak@@ eholder groups have set the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States .
Wei@@ fence project is Elem@@ ent@@ ar
the Fisch@@ erb@@ acher Wei@@ fence @-@ Project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year .
the CDU Bundestag filed Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac took a picture in front of the place .
in the court yard of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family , the representative of the Fisch@@ erb@@ acher met in the CDU area together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann initially granted in@@ sights into his operation in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as many young animals , and houses in five apartments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; Black &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black milk &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the alternative way for the milk of its cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the table of the tourist guests there are only regional .
as it is also the HV @-@ Chairman of Fisch@@ erb@@ ach , he called the Wei@@ fence project as &quot; Elem@@ ent@@ ar . &quot;
I can not generate non@@ profit econom@@ ies on der@@ art .
the green space for much work , much must be mach@@ ined with the brush@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have here with the terms and top@@ ography &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was stressed by Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he acquired the el@@ ong@@ ated operation and supervised this without chemical plant protection and fertil@@ is@@ ers , even if it does not lead a bioci@@ dal operation .
Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; the municipality has recognized the significance of the electric fence and is happy about the leader funding . &quot;
for the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare , farmers will have to be supported .
one hope that the view of the surfaces could still be pulled out for a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have , are the people who work in agriculture and will make thoughts about how they continue their operation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the farmers are often due to support in criticism
over the electric fence , a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 .
the re@@ tention surface is thus 40 hectares , which cannot be for@@ ged until at least 2023 .
of the total cost of 71 500 euros , half of leader was funded by leader , a quarter carried the community of fishermen .
thus the farmers had to invest € 12 610 , which they had to invest in 16@@ .2 kilometres of electric fence .
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; stated Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; you do not make a good job , without farmers and conc@@ ession doesn &apos;t go . &quot;
also for Peter White : &quot; the best food products are produced here . &quot;
the rural conservation line ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows the state support of f@@ ences of f@@ ences .
the aim is to dis@@ close the Black Forest .
prer@@ equ@@ is@@ ite is the presence of one of the L@@ PR carriers .
in addition , the in@@ crimin@@ ating surface must not be f@@ row@@ ed , ( Hang@@ ing ascent above 35 percent ) and must be threatened by landing .
for the 2018 Au@@ erb@@ acher Wei@@ fence project , the request of eight participants will run with 24 plots , which would like to build almost 16 kilometres per fence .
the area of dis@@ closure corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump is now taking up the Statue of Liberty before
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is to attack the statues .
Americans estimate the same as any other - therefore the fail@@ ures of Saddam Hussein &apos;s performance on the Fir@@ dos place in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the tr@@ ump regime , knew quite what he did when he took a symbolic figure in an he@@ at@@ onic battle with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CN@@ N on the proposals for the dra@@ stic limitation of the legitim@@ ate immig@@ ration to the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller did not handle the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of bo@@ ast@@ ers and Liberty @-@ Im@@ it@@ ators would have compassion for him if he had done it .
but he attacked their significance , and in particular the importance that it was attributed to her , when the famous po@@ em was added by Emma Lazarus , 17 years after the completion of the monument , its base was added .
when Miller wrote A@@ co@@ sta : &quot; I don &apos;t want to enter a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that ligh@@ tens the world .
the po@@ em , which was added later , was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is right properly , but how he formulated it himself , does not really go about history .
it is about the contemporary reson@@ ance to the sh@@ ak@@ eup words of Lazarus , the only one in which a state does not only load any old immig@@ rants , but the p@@ oo@@ rest of the poor : &quot; your labor , thy poor , and your op@@ pressed masses , which looked after that are free to bre@@ athe , / the end waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time in which the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; el@@ ende &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was better to see on our screens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller did not eng@@ age in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA .
this conflict on the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural conflicts : it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who were interested in placing their words after their death at the base - knew very good that they were able to complete a high political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American rep@@ ublic@@ ans by applying them in an un@@ used classical presentation of the femin@@ ism of freedom .
Lazarus also changed this meaning : in its po@@ em , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she herself is a very different name : mother of the Ex@@ il@@ ant .
the combination of the image with the picture is a brilliant fem@@ inist cou@@ p and a devastating attack on the US Nati@@ vity .
and just as Lazarus had changed the significance of the statue , they wanted to change the people from the right wing .
the great cry of Rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argu@@ ed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty could not invite , but rather an early Ne@@ o@@ con@@ voy , which will bring the American flame into the world : &quot; Lady Liberty continues .
it is supposed to bear the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States in the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch shall not shine on the way to the United States . &quot;
quite unusual , Lim@@ bau@@ gh starts to something .
the meaning of the statue is quite and even a question of the stand@@ point of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative indeed of Lazarus was therein , they looked so to see how they were seen by the troubled , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible trips on the de@@ cks of ships .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true in the true sense that the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and improve their lives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
their statue says to them the words of hope and of the welcome that they must hear .
and this is not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump ever would like to recognize .
their tor@@ ch shall not shine the way , but the hat@@ red , which is the only source of power .
world Championship 2017 : Neil Black lo@@ aves Scottish members of the UK
Eil@@ id@@ h Do@@ yle is remin@@ is@@ cent of a time when only two all@@ ots belonged to the United Kingdom team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance director of athlet@@ ics of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member cont@@ ingent of cont@@ ingent claims in the world championship race is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a massive contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London in 2017 , which starts on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; developed something special in Scotland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the athlet@@ ics of the United Kingdom have to learn from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it , and we will try to understand and we will pass it until we &apos;ll need to figure , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they did .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they did .
British Athlet@@ ics : it has something to do with what they did .
and also with the type at the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates , among them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - who can compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah at the 5.000 m distance , while Eil@@ id@@ h Do@@ yle was elected team member .
&quot; Eil@@ id@@ h is quite modest .
her captains of surrender was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a series of athletes , whether they were Scottish or , wherever they live or practice , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motiv@@ ated .
the passion and the genuine feeling that Eil@@ id@@ h completely destroyed , were great . &quot;
the Commonwealth of the Commonwealth of Silver medal , which will compete in their fifth World Championships at 400 @-@ m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 vill@@ i are in the British team .
the best number of athletes at the world championship were seven , which had been achieved in 1983 and 2015 .
the Middle distance runner M@@ ir leads on this path and has placed five British and two European records last year .
it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman to observe the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games .
Do@@ yle is remin@@ is@@ cent of their first world championships , when the only other Scot@@ sman was Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; teams &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said that it is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enorm@@ ously proud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the fact that many of their coun@@ try@@ men should not only belong to the team , but in some cases also with the medals and the Finn@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so special thing about his team member states that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was so important to know that my team @-@ mates voted for me and chose me , making it something very special for me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the sh@@ all@@ ots that belong to the team .
it only shows how far we came .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to rise to Po@@ dia .
what to see my speech as a chapter ?
yes , I think it went well .
I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation , since we have a home World Championship .
so it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from it that we are again at the Olympiastadion .
I get a second chance to go and compete there , and it &apos;s just as a great atmosphere there . &quot;
block reviews on Facebook : don &apos;t work for a public office if you do not wear the sel@@ ections of voters
the father of our land knew something from bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers beat him because of everything , from internal policies to its political principles .
he left the cr@@ iti@@ que of criticism , safe .
but he didn &apos;t put his critics to silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because in the year 1783 Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Free Spe@@ ech can be taken away - and , stup@@ id , and dum@@ b we are led like the sheep for slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Maryland to Govern@@ or Larry H@@ og@@ an who needs to work more than Washington .
h@@ og@@ ans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and had deleted their opinion on its official Facebook page .
and in the beginning of this week , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union mour@@ ned him as a result of this week .
the staff of the Govern@@ ors dismissed the complaint as a fri@@ es , and the online comment was full of a counter action with &quot; Na , &quot; and ? . &quot;
&quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; said many people .
but it is important .
and it &apos;s especially important when it is a type of h@@ og@@ an .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazing .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a re@@ ac@@ tionary p@@ inion .
he has shown strong hand at the leadership of his state and str@@ ingent compliance with principles .
he was also very sent to use Facebook as a primary means to connect to its voters and play his hair @-@ loose head to chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , the blocking of persons who come across the governor &apos;s side - which is a public forum which is officially designated as officially and by employees who are paid by public tax @-@ Dollars - un@@ necessarily and eventually dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post Office Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse de@@ pri@@ des the actions of the governor and argu@@ ed that the blocking of comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it &apos;s too easy to use the image of un@@ controlled or mo@@ ist people or h@@ uts filled people who make the wh@@ ip online .
the post said with some of the real people blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
and these are just real people who speak with their chosen leaders , a teacher , a business@@ man , and a priest , no ti@@ ring .
they all said that their comments are respec@@ t@@ ful , thought and not prof@@ ane .
the priest quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to H@@ og@@ ans of the Catholic faith .
attor@@ ney at Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani from Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not h@@ asser@@ ted , but she asked to hate Hass@@ elt .
&quot; I commented on the pol@@ ite that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate and other current news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary area of the news program &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t give this idea even if a number of people on the same subject takes place , then they are ab@@ used by some more than a so @-@ called so @-@ called so @-@ called so @-@ called so @-@ called &quot; people . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the employees of the govern@@ ors as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam @-@ attack &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; would probably be called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inter@@ c@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply plug@@ ged a critic or deleted a negative comment .
it is much clean@@ er than in previous time when you have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical mission articles and to burn them to burn them to silence or to silence .
but it just happens digitally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public officials , which critic@@ ises that he has vacc@@ inated Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is used by Twitter users , blocked by his Twitter Feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell last week in Virginia .
the president of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors des Lou@@ dou@@ n County passed the First A@@ un@@ ment , according to U.S. District Judge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria when she is a voters of their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Govern@@ or Matt Before ( R ) received a visit from AC@@ L@@ U because of its usage of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington &apos;s time , the time of affordable Por@@ tos had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers will be varied between 1776 and 1800 , and anonymous letter was struck by his lead .
and even then Washington had an anonymous roll .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the people , the pseud@@ ony@@ ms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Bel@@ is@@ us , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pet@@ itions that critic@@ ized his position on the contract of Am@@ ity , the trade and navigation of the United Kingdom critic@@ ised his ministry , according to the historical documents published by the Online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project .
but he didn &apos;t have her to silence .
freedom of freedom , dis@@ courses and dis@@ courses are based on our nation &apos;s foundation .
and true leadership means to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty ho@@ ur@@ ly hop@@ ing for domestic comfort in Renaissance Club
the former European no . 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope in the next three days on domestic comfort , since the Renaissance Club in East Loth@@ ian will host the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who led to the arch@@ e@@ field last year , before joining Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament sp@@ ies in the name of the club , and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi .
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he reaches his fame in this event , said Raff@@ er@@ ty .
&quot; players will see this course from his best side , it is in a great condition .
Jerry did a great job when he set this place .
he is a je@@ al@@ ous author of this game and is proud of its performance here .
this is a great show@@ case for this course . &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is pleased to defend a championship for the first time , although he won in his 32 @-@ year career in both European tour and the European Challenge Tour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that feels really especially , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in south@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I have not defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open , since they had won them in the year after I had won them out of the program .
back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of the last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon , last year here .
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot;
Gary OR@@ R who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50th birthday in this year , returns to the action on his home .
this event will be the first Scottish gig since Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s always a bit more if you play at home &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said OR@@ R , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you want it well , but you felt this additional pressure .
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad , as far as it went . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the trio on the field , the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the Senior Major champ@@ ions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ FC .
OR@@ R and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce are one of the six carrots in the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond .
the entrance is free , the parking costs £ 5 per car with a occup@@ ants and £ 10 per car with two or more occup@@ ants .
all proceeds going to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less lung cancer by passive smoke
in the past two decades , less people are dead because of passive smoking in lung cancer .
the results of the University Clin@@ ics of Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 167 lung cancer cases are attributable to passive smoke per year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in comparison , he moved to this topic in 1994 .
at that time there were still 400 lung cancer cases due to passive smoking a year in Germany .
the new investigation is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
connections have to be considered very complex
the construction work in the Vill@@ inger street are in full swing and &quot; are reas@@ on@@ ably positioned in the period , &quot; says the head of the Bau@@ vey@@ ard Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of household connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as in the underground , what is not indicated in the plans .
the traffic , which imp@@ aired the construction work , represents a big problem for the construction of the company St@@ ump@@ p .

poverty and death in Indonesian Gold@@ land
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i cook the dinner , they don &apos;t use a stove .
it even uses sel@@ dom a sau@@ cep@@ an .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of Pan@@ i@@ ai reg@@ ent@@ ele in the in@@ tran@@ qui@@ Indonesian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally as &quot; Not@@ a &quot; - directly in the chim@@ ney .
after half an hour the carbon@@ ated cre@@ pe is taken up with eggs , un@@ washed hands and swal@@ lowed up .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture , where she also leads their daily work , for example clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a homeless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
the youngest of the four wives of their husband were not assigned to their fields .
poly@@ gam@@ ie is common here .
of course it may be too dangerous : most vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many drink it , and there are soldiers .
&quot; nobody wants to run out after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; she says .
it is a more rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 after a controversi@@ al referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,0@@ 26 elders should not tune in front of the occupying troops .
an existing movement that touched the independence of the Dutch rule , turned quickly against the government of Jakarta , which maintains the control of the region and foreign journalists or legal observ@@ ations .
in 2003 , the province was officially split in Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , with the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea as the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is so far as it is desert . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then an morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car rental .
there are no public transport .
the city with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants , consists of wooden houses , surrounded by bam@@ bo@@ o gl@@ ars , and made of corrugated roofs , that were converted through rust in several yellow tones .
only very few Indones@@ ians have made their journey here , ref@@ ill for journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian mission@@ aries , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans accused a God called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to bear this clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and indicates her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dar@@ ker shirt and her light rock . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier we had only leaves to our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indonesia &apos;s province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst child mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but there is also Indones@@ ians Gold@@ land .
the biggest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gr@@ ass@@ berg , owned by Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort has dismant@@ led the value of 3.1 billion US dollars in gold and copper .
in addition , Pap@@ ua has Holz@@ res@@ sources valued at an estimated 78 billion US dollars .
however , these wealth are however a source of mis@@ ery for the Pap@@ ua , ensuring that Indonesia &apos;s authorized military has preserved a great presence .
a study of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort local military personnel and units accounted for almost 20 million US dollars , among them up to 150,000 US dollars to a single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ anic claims for larger autonomy thre@@ aten these golden mit@@ ans and are gn@@ aw@@ lessly treated .
according to activists , more than 500,000 Pap@@ ua has been killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped by the Indonesian military since 1969 , tor@@ tured and imprisoned .
mass@@ acres in Pap@@ u@@ as headquarters in Pap@@ u@@ as tri@@ land in the 1970 @-@ s were referred to in accordance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission for genocide .
the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators in the region alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a report by the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese Brisbane from 2016 , in which reports about atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as some legal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric supplements are particularly popular - and the brutal decline of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims which happen every week , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researchers for Human Rights Watch .
screws have strengthened themselves , as Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring a influ@@ x of settlements from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants is of the province of 83 % of Christian , but the demo@@ graphic development changed from the most popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ aw@@ esi .

the Indonesian President J@@ oko Wi@@ do@@ do , known in folk and as j@@ ok@@ ow@@ i , spoke to the ine@@ qualities and legal violations in Pap@@ ua during his election campaign in 2014 .
the former Zimmermann secured 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the Presi@@ dential Palace in Jakarta .
but in Pap@@ ua has changed little , and today the loc@@ als feel betrayed .
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , with anticip@@ ation that he will accompl@@ ish our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; says You .
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai was just two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is inauguration in October .
on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols prior to a bon@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke out on a motorcycle by the darkness .
the troubled children said to them that they should turn off their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers took a cl@@ ash to her tone and later returned to four soldiers , the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
soldiers who had drunk drunk , they struck the group with their soldiers , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
a child who was 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ um@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ o , was so difficult to fall into the coma .
a few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was set in fire and the things es@@ cal@@ ved on the next day .
about 1,000 young par@@ ua men , women and children gathered themselves together at a soccer field in front of the local police station and the military commander to demand justice .
they were cap@@ tiv@@ ated Jag@@ db@@ ye and led the Wa@@ ita @-@ Dance - in the circle and a bird @-@ sung - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ Stamm .
some demonstr@@ ators began to drag along police and military posts .
when the atmosphere was heated , the soldiers had sent a command to an internal radio : &quot; when the masses are more than three times , they shoot dead , &quot; it is written in an official document of TI@@ ME , which was not released to local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the director of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ Vier@@ t@@ els of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the dro@@ pping danger and called to rest , calling the amount to return home .
no one was able to listen to the atmosphere .
&quot; when I turned down , I suddenly shot in my left hand , he said TI@@ ME on the porch of his colorful wooden house .
Kay@@ ame doesn &apos;t know who had been fired , but says that the ball came out of the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was crow@@ ded , many shots were fired ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he adds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was taken three times , so his c@@ ousin , the witness of the shooting was .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and therefore teach his body to make sure it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es , who bears as many Indones@@ ians only a name , the TI@@ ME in a dark mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him . &quot;
Che@@ chen @-@ police , Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende , said Rep@@ orters , said that his officers only wanted to secure their station , because they attacked her station .
&quot; we must defend ourselves if people threatened to kill us , &quot; the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner P@@ ud@@ jo Su@@ list@@ i@@ yo , in 2015 .
&quot; it &apos;s life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured .
the news about the du@@ cks were only filtered on the following day &apos; to Jakarta .
three weeks , Jok@@ ow@@ i spent a passionate talk in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura , in which he expressed sympath@@ ies for families of victims , s@@ ware to tackle the historical abuse of Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to be solved immediately , so that in the future it will not happen anymore , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Minister of Security Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 that he ple@@ ad an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the settlement of historical human rights violations .
but the failure began almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries occurred before long time .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and at the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
the point is that we have committed to go these violations , but there are processes that have to pass through , &quot; he said .
then he made a retreat when he spoke to TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jakarta , and said he has no plans to create a complaint mechanism in Pap@@ ua .
instead , everything is legally regulated , &quot; he said .
the vort@@ ex that accused the UN for crimes against humanity , demanded that 11 cases of human rights violations in East Tim@@ or said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua had already been buried , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai pre@@ case .
families of Pan@@ i@@ ai victims took such claims against fur@@ y un@@ believers .
&quot; I have been inter@@ viewed for the last three years but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es .
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid of being arrested by the military , I &apos;m afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was defeated by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I had buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the army sought to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the shooting buildings have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police shot at the village of Pan@@ i@@ ai neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
during a con@@ front@@ ation between vill@@ agers and the Manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma , who refused to bring a conscious man into the hospital , a person and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man who was d@@ row@@ ned 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was d@@ row@@ ned in a near river , died in the way to the hospital .
in front of the company there were protest@@ ers protest@@ ers in front of the company &apos;s site .
the police said that the vill@@ agers were cast on officers , re@@ acted by using warning shots .
but native people say that the mobile Brigade ( Indonesian par@@ amil@@ itary police ) began to shoot at the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in pan@@ ic , we have fear that there will be reven@@ ge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u B@@ adi@@ i , who lives in the vicinity of the hospital , and witness as the last here is , as the TI@@ ME .
&quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament called on to withdraw the participating officers to withdraw and withdraw the mobile Brigade of the police in the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a wor@@ r@@ ying for the Indonesian government .
the lack of sen@@ su@@ al development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the owners Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many included the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel Army , who claims to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by em@@ it spor@@ adic attacks and kidn@@ apping of Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , among them T@@ adi@@ us Y@@ og@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ oya .
in response to the past few years , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbitr@@ arily taken into custody , under the pre@@ text of the &quot; securing of national so@@ vereig@@ n@@ ty . &quot;
some of them never appear .
Pan@@ i@@ ai is a tragic and forgotten place among men in Pap@@ ua .
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the bit rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is too expensive for loc@@ als .
bread is equal to range .
the people build here everything they eat : especially not@@ ation and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women that can process four or five fields of sweet potato .
they retain the majority of the harvest@@ ing for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of not@@ a tast@@ es only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 cents ) .
over time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the local Pap@@ ua and the new migrants who have arrived in a larger number since the opening of new air routes to the Nab@@ ire airport .
the few jobs that are in the region are usually coming to the better trained and we@@ al@@ thy migran@@ t .
Pap@@ ua has rarely the capital , or the necessary skills to make their own company competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ i , the chairman of the headquarters of Pan@@ i@@ ai .
isolation maintains the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
in addition , restrictions on the coverage of international media are stra@@ ined .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Bas@@ ille Long@@ ch@@ amp have been deported to Pap@@ ua as a lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although they were given the rare permission to films .
according to Ph@@ el@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of j@@ ok@@ ow@@ is campaign have been able to raise the restrictions on coverage to promote transparency and development , not realized .
&quot; there are new haz@@ ards for foreign journalists who try to report of Indonesia in@@ tran@@ qui@@ ous provinces of Pap@@ ua and West pap@@ ua : visa @-@ ref@@ us@@ al and a black list , &quot; he said in a statement .
lack of press monitoring means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March of the six Pacific states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ ine islands and the Salom@@ one Islands - the UN Human Rights Council , the &quot; different and widespread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same lands have also seen the O@@ PM .
the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha Nas@@ ir rejected the alleg@@ ations of the Group and said re@@ por@@ ters in Jakarta : &quot; in Indonesia still a democratic system , and there are free media , so it is difficult to prevent the evidence of human rights ab@@ uses . &quot;
the people want to know that more foreign governments should take this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the Human Rights ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura had left their silence and ur@@ ged him &quot; We want freedom &quot; according to a source which also participated in the meeting , but anonymous .
in 2019 , Indonesia has a further presidential election but the Pap@@ ua is probably not to vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i .
Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good inten@@ tions , but it is surrounded by people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ i , the chairman of the master Council .
he wants to know that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that it lives under the constant threat of a military military , in poverty and health services .
Gob@@ i says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , will consider their vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; gu@@ ilt that he has to pay back .
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they want only righteousness , &quot; he says .
despite the thre@@ ats and en@@ roll@@ ments , families of Pan@@ i@@ ai Sch@@ uss@@ aud carried out a last symbolic act of symbolic letter : the dead body was buried on a complex opposite the police and the military station .
they know that no justice will never be justified , but at least , they don &apos;t forget their crimes .
&quot; one member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with a lowered head .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai to the second time
a fire was found on Friday in one of the highest residential doors of the world in Dubai . hundreds of residents , of which 337 meters high , 79 @-@ storey building will flee .
it is the second fire that f@@ ails in just two years through the sky@@ scra@@ per , which is called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; we slept and we have stood at the fire alarm and at the cry of the people .
we cut down the steps down , and it took about 10 minutes to come from the 50th floor to the bottom , &quot; told a resident that has named his name as George , Reuters .
Dub@@ ais civil protection authorities said that the units of fire fighting is at 4.00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) and the building will cool off .
the government said they work on the provision of shel@@ ters for the person concerned .
the incident may be asked questions regarding the safety of materials , used in exterior areas of high @-@ buildings around the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the largest part of the damage from the covering , the outer covering for decoration or insulation came .
in Great Britain , the police , they believe that the system of plates for isolation and covering at the London Gren@@ elle tower in June which could have contributed a fire of a fire which died around 80 people .
no Davis Cup Reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International tennis courts ( IT@@ F ) is pleased with his big Davis Cup coup at the Annual General Meeting .
at the meeting held in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the proposal for this sport revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup @-@ single , only supported on two winning sets , Hau@@ ch@@ thin is not supported by the necessary two @-@ third majority .
although this is often very long but even so very estimated five @-@ set classic stay remain the traditional competition so far .
6@@ 3,@@ 54 percent of the member states voted for reform the target of IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only missed .
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members have not adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup .
we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of this ic@@ onic and historic competitions , &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty .
you will continue to work to improve the application .
not until the vote was before , after many influences the proposal came to reach the final in a neutral place .
new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively smaller detail : the fin@@ alists at the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be the host right in the first round in the first round .
in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements are facilit@@ ated in terms of training places , etc. and players will need to do fewer official media events before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 of 5 U.S. Travel@@ ers offer forbidden items into the plane , finds a survey out
a survey conducted among flight passengers revealed that more than 20 percent deliber@@ ate or un@@ aware of any objects at the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent , which brought the airplane , while they were acci@@ dentally sealed knives or other objects with blades .
less than 1 per cent claimed that they had to be discovered that they have travelled ir@@ oned with fire@@ arms , amm@@ o or explo@@ si@@ ves .
the survey carried out more than 1,000 people - which was carried out by a jet fuel service , the Strat@@ os Jet char@@ ters Inc . , was also noted that younger trav@@ ellers have to viol@@ ate the rules .
of the respon@@ dents , the add@@ ons , that they were trying to fly with something to fly from the T@@ SA , were 19.@@ 7 percent more mill@@ enni@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent , members of the generation X were .
the most common objects that have been prescribed by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent said they have carried out objects with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of female respon@@ dents and 3.7 percent of the male respon@@ dents have also confirmed that they might have been inten@@ tionally forbidden drugs .
the company said that trav@@ ellers have asked travelers throughout the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally Schm@@ ug@@ gel@@ ding had been caused by the airport security and how many things they had done so far .
it &apos;s no surprise that people who are most likely to wear in the most likely sm@@ ug@@ ely , ignor@@ ant of safety , those who are most frequently used .
however , the company indicates that the T@@ SA Guidel@@ ines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using .
people often are uns@@ af@@ e that fluids have to carry or how much of it .
so it &apos;s not a surprise that the largest amount of the T@@ SA conf@@ is@@ cated objects are prohibited .
a time long , the people , the T@@ SA could view books as Schm@@ ug@@ le@@ ware .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k is no matter : tens of thousands of Tesla customers to order
electro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k are delighted with the huge number of pre@@ aches to his new Tesla &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
so far , he has now under@@ gone that a part of the customer has withdrawn its non @-@ binding reservation again .
besides the always triumph@@ al figures to increase sales gains and even more huge sales target , Tesla Chef El@@ on Mus@@ k has first revealed a second , less gl@@ itter@@ ing number : if cancelled in the new mass market in the new 3 @-@ year mass market .
Mus@@ k had frequently used more than 500,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery is right now .
now Mus@@ k is a : from the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders , 63@@ .000 have already been withdrawn .
critics always agree that it is merely a non @-@ exist@@ ent reservations .
in case of cancellation , Tesla pays the 1000 Euro in the US $ 1000 ( in the US $ 1000 ) , and in the UK 1000 Po@@ unds ) .
currently , 45@@ 5,000 such non @-@ free reservations , were found in a telephone conference with anal@@ ysts .
however , the Tesla boss could not be a problem for the cancellation of about twelve percent of all orders .
its argument : the challenge for the ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production site .
in the past year Tesla has delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
in 2018 it will be - all models together - 500.000 its , 2020 a million .
demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , there are currently 1,800 reservations per day .
who can now order a &quot; Model 3 &quot; in the second half of 2018 , if Tesla creates it , its brand new , still never in the practice tested production lines without bigger inter@@ ruption with maximum load of utilization .
many experts doub@@ ting that this is possible .
but then comes to larger del@@ ays , then the in@@ compati@@ iti@@ vity of the reservations may be solved for Tesla .
for then , the company can &apos;t have any satisfied customers to exp@@ ire in pairs .
EPA CEO P@@ ru@@ itt moves to reduce emissions due to the execution of Obama &apos;s rules to reduce emissions
one day after he had been accused of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the Chief of the Environmental Protection Authority , was able to delayed its previous decision to reduce the implementation of the Obama era to reduce emissions of smo@@ g pollut@@ ants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change , when his agency proved to meet the needs of the state pollution in government faster than previous devast@@ ation .
he mentioned the action against his previous place in a Federal Court of Appeals .
it concerns a deadline taken on 1 October for States to comply with the 2015 standards for floor level ozone .
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would not hesitate to spend more time in order to study his authority , and to avoid the plan in local decisions , or economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump Prosecutor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a long time a reliable opponent on environmental protection regulations .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt is repeated to block or delayed to block or delayed , to which the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels have contra@@ cted .
the ab@@ rupt transition from Wednesday is the most recent legal return for the regulatory submission back agenda .
last month , a Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the EPA Ver@@ wal@@ ker has exceeded its authority , when he tried to adopt the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , the oil and gas companies on the monitoring and reduction of methane le@@ cks to be delayed .
on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt set his position on Wednesday that his swe@@ eping st@@ ice at the ozone level , simply struck the read@@ iness of the EPA for cooperation with the United States to fulfil the ful@@ fill@@ ment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under earlier administ@@ r@@ ations , the EPA often won the dead@@ lines for carrying out and then was accused of being accused of being led by activists , and in an agreement the date for implementing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation by trial procedures , and we do dead@@ lines .
we also accept the law and authority who gives us seriously . &quot;
however , the opinion of the EPA that P@@ ru@@ itt is going to use his &quot; power to delay and all the other copyright to ensure that the regulations are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in the congress will be on a more comprehensive re@@ version of the ozone rules .
last month approval bill , the implementation of the 2015 rules shall be delayed by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet completed in the Senate .
the New York General At@@ tor@@ ney , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , led by the Coalition led to the EPA in this week , said the Group intends to just@@ ify the statutory pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of the EPA - according to our clari@@ fication - is an important profit for health and safety of these 6.7 million new Yor@@ kers and the over 115 million Americans that are directly affected by the Smo@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York included in this case California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ sy@@ l@@ van@@ ien , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil ozone is created when pollut@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere are react to sunlight .
the resulting smoke can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups and contribute to thousands of premature f@@ atal@@ ities every year .
representatives of public health and environmental protection che@@ ered over P@@ ru@@ ten of surprising course changes .
&quot; it is wor@@ r@@ ying , how much pressure it needs to get this sen@@ sible step by the responsible for the protection of the air that we in@@ hale , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Diversity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight against the ide@@ ological clo@@ ak of the Tr@@ ump government to tackle environmental poll@@ uted and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Walter Martini emphas@@ ises : &quot; it is a unique d@@ ör@@ gy group . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us chapel mentioned for the first time mentioned in the Württemberg State Court : count Hermann of Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the proven parish church of Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
according to the wording of the document , on the Tum@@ linger mountain apart from the former parish church there is a splendid farm that belonged to the church or patron law and not vice versa .
so there were people there .
as from the description of the Upper Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 1858 , was next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which today still exists in the local area of tum@@ ours , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the magnificent settlement of the village .
old cards from the period around the year 1600 support this historical circumstances .
the Pat@@ ron@@ ats@@ recht was created from the early medieval owner .
one Lord , who built a church , took place and occupied with a pastor , remains the owner of this church and could also inherit these owners .
in order to establish a pastor , a pastor , or the bishop a priest .
three altars were there in the church and two bells on the tower .
the greatest of the two cr@@ ush@@ es at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell was then for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be submitted during World War II in 1942 .
in the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 1648 ) the window plates were st@@ ained and the bell rop@@ es were stolen .
the roof was in@@ dense .
in 1796 French troops camped near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used it as a fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened in 1809 .
until 1869 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius @-@ cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead out of Hör@@ schwe@@ iler .
in 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demolished .
only the steep@@ le was left .
in the New Year of 1834 , a storm donated the steep@@ le and the half collap@@ sed .
to avoid mis@@ fortune , the tower was demolished .
only the existing tower @-@ wer@@ g still remained the witness of the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
today , Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em was the successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn , the Hil@@ arius plant as a successor to Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn .

association wants to verify permission from win@@ dr@@ au@@ ders
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not see any legal foundation for the construction and is therefore turned to the landing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is called Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CDU ) to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is illegal .
the association argu@@ ed that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved , since at the time in Vier@@ sen only at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal a wind force concentration zone exists .
within this concentration area , construction and operation of wind turbines are possible , at the same time , the concentration zone causes an exclusion of wind turbines for the rest of the city area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many zones should avoid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saving &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the city quadru@@ pled as a few days earlier by a change in the land area plan a second wind force zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette - but which had not been approved by the Düsseldorf District government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning authority , the approval of approval is illegal and may also decrease , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ kens , Chairman of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of things : the city council decided again in front of the summer break once again the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette ; an approval of the district government is still standing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ kens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the place of approval for the construction of wind turbines planned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the collection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letter has been entered in the district quadru@@ pled since last week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes you to the occasion to check the issue again .
but they do not lead to that the procedure is stopped .
with a view on the ongoing process of the administration of the Board of Directors on Thursday , the circle does not want to express itself in regards to the arg@@ um@@ entation of the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; .
NEW Re , a subsidiary of NEW , is planning on an area at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette the construction of four each 200 meters high winds .
already last year , the company , which is involved in the town of Vier@@ sen , took part in the owners of approximately 65 hectares with the owners of approximately 65 hectares .
with the establishment of four wind turbines the power requirement of around 11 400 households should be covered - this is equivalent to one fifth of the electricity needs of all four households .
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
in the last summer there was a green light for buying three wind turbines in the wind farm Lin@@ ni@@ ch at Aachen , as well as a participation in the wind energy plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the Hein@@ sberg district .

Tr@@ ump replaced the tran@@ scription of telephone calls in Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scription of telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and Leadership of Mexico and Australia were published by Washington Post .
on January 27 , Tr@@ ump called for a telephone at the Mexican President En@@ rique Ni@@ eto on the 27th of January , said that he would not pay for a planned cross wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US president accused him , because he publicly declared the wall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump launched its presidential campaign with its promise to establish a wall in the southern border of the USA , and swore to make Mexico for the project .
tran@@ scription of his first annex@@ ation with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ outs have been published and revealed a cl@@ amped replacement .
Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ hout , that a trade for the United States immig@@ rants to take place &quot; ri@@ cul@@ ous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; stup@@ id , &quot; and that the existence of the government would like to look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the United States .
Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call after he had spoken to Mr. Turn@@ hout , &quot; that is the un@@ acceptable call for the whole day . &quot;
Moo@@ res Ford @-@ mass@@ acres : activ@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for righteousness again
a 1948 @-@ year @-@ old Ford Mercury sailed by a group of audience in rural Monroe , Georgia , and moved to the Ford Bridge by Moore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , the bridge could reach the bridge , a group of white men joined forces to block his way .
the leader of the Mo@@ bs - a man middle age in a needle &apos;s strike - took a long train on his cig@@ ar and looked at through the wind@@ shield .
inside and in@@ woven the occup@@ ants in fear .
&quot; we want this n -@@ --- r Roger ! &quot; sh@@ ined the man .
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ ams , the silence , when a young black man was dist@@ orted by the passenger seat .
fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on July 22nd , was only a follow @-@ up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if a sn@@ ares are thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was cast out almost all in the audience . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 , Mayor &apos;s Ford Bridge come back to Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black pairs - Roger and Doro@@ thy Mal@@ com and George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u Kl@@ ux Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one has ever been indicted for the murder .
&quot; it is truly un@@ belief that in all these years no only person was arrested - although we know them in our municipalities , though we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks who helps the organization of follow @-@ up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dirt spot on a history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bro@@ oks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former Congress of Georgia in Georgia and a Life of Citi@@ zens .
it serves as a dramatic call for action as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual reminder of the Monroe Community which has never been corrected .
&quot; we want prosec@@ utions , we want the termination , we want Re@@ conc@@ iliation , but first we need to receive justice , &quot; he said .
&quot; we cannot get to healing and reconciliation until we receive righteousness . &quot;
a cour@@ age@@ ous place of jurisdiction puts a cloth on the loan of one of the victims of Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on 27 July 1946 .
according to FB@@ I files that were obtained by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected of the Lyn@@ ch@@ process .
but none was ever accused .
although the susp@@ ects has been on the free foot for decades , Citi@@ zenship , that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions in the whole city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court ruled the black citizens in Georgia to vote for their voice in the summer .
about the same time like the election of the FB@@ I of the black paint ch@@ at@@ le Roger Mal@@ col@@ der , a white base owner , Bar@@ kind H@@ ester , during a struggle - allegedly due to a woman .
Bro@@ oks said that rum@@ or was in the city that H@@ ester with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Doro@@ thy slept and that the baby she bore it , was not of her husband .
on July 25 , 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from the prison , the FB@@ I .
he was accompanied by Doro@@ thy and her cou@@ sins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to the prison .
but when she was then removed from the prison , the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge drew near , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b attacked the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it was found , Har@@ rison , who prepared the mur@@ ders and arranged , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; closes this from a FB@@ I Report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is obviously obvious that there was a conspi@@ racy between the state and local criminal prosecution that had not only been involved in the mur@@ ders , claiming the evidence and the identity of witnesses did . &quot;
Bro@@ oks form@@ ulates it even more pronounced .
&quot; it was a elec@@ toral massacre , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you register and vote , then you will happen here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for almost a decade , Cass@@ and@@ ra Gre@@ ene has led the annual follow @-@ up of the Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their representation is vi@@ vid , gri@@ pping and is designed in a kind of deep rac@@ ism , who would like to believe that he is no longer exists in America .
it is difficult to see , and yet more difficult to see , but Gre@@ ene said that the point is .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to speak about the Lyn@@ n , because we will face all the wat@@ ering in us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can &apos;t build any relationship with you , if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I did . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - in a room and list@@ ens , when Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ played overview over the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a co @-@ director here .
he played the role of the chef @-@ C@@ lan@@ tern &apos;s role for years , but he said that the role will never make easier .
&quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it is very important to get this story about life because we would not want to return to these days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room , the actor D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sh@@ aw and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nice H@@ ester , their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester an@@ cri@@ es and pushed him to sleep with his wife Doro@@ thy slept with his wife Doro@@ thy .
&quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll be afraid of my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shave hin@@ ts the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all the black actors ) breaks out in gel .
Gre@@ ene laugh@@ s at the chief .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked shaving .
he is al@@ arms and conf@@ used .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; Gre@@ ene , I said , always k@@ ich@@ i .
&quot; I just didn &apos;t think that white people at that time &quot; n &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; but , &quot; one of the other black per@@ formers .
&quot; you only have to hit the &apos; hard &apos; R. &apos; .
and precisely there is moving the energy in the room , a feeling of camera body replaces the dis@@ comfort .
everybody is busy with this , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene starts again .
this time , when Ras@@ cona the N saying goes , he says it sharp and with re@@ print .
absolutely no laugh .
this repet@@ ition expi@@ res and fast .
there are cry , shots and then silence .
a woman , dressed in a tragedy , stands over the course of the actors and leads cheap holidays of Lo@@ bre@@ de Lo@@ bre@@ de Lo@@ bre@@ de Lo@@ bre@@ de &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot;
their voice breaks out at every second word .
about one hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen were swe@@ at and tears of the eyes .
the audience is almost equally divided between black and white .
one pair is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , traveled to see the performance , many are coming down only .
they have experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as an impressive moisture , when Bro@@ oks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point the mor@@ n has remained an A@@ ne@@ d@@ ote , but now if one found on the same country where Lyn@@ ch Mor@@ se took care of the air .
if the latest notes of the songs sound , Gre@@ ene invites the amount to come closer and inspec@@ ting the dead bodies .
children ho@@ res on their heads , register the f@@ ake blood and the quiet bodies and whis@@ per each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is a small boy , as he would like to remember it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after some minutes the full of the amount - and suddenly it is over .
the actors t@@ oss the Lyn@@ x trail and wake her tears .
Brad@@ sh@@ aw um@@ ar@@ mt Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit that gave the C@@ lan@@ d member .
Nick Ras@@ cona um@@ ar@@ mt two of his players , and then breaks in their poor wine , and the emotional load of the performance breaks even with him .
&quot; it is okay , &quot; whis@@ per one of the women .
&quot; we know that it is not in your heart .
you have done it from a reason . &quot;
later the audience moves together with the actors for dinner .
a white pair of Atlanta enriched a white pair of ha@@ iling across a black pair , with a black pair that they just learned .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ ski strug@@ gled to find words , giving the feeling the performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... of people who look like yourself and do that , because they look like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said she . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what really does that do with me lets me believe that the Lyn@@ ne will still go on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added a police sli@@ pped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same space , Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks &apos;s farm keeps on his table , he e@@ ats and remin@@ is@@ cent of the civil rights .
he said he started to plan the performance in the next year .
&quot; the follow @-@ up is inspir@@ ing in a certain way , because it describes the fear of what we have done , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is so if we learn from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he who does not study his own story , who does not know his own story is condemned to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; go@@ d@@ us@@ k &quot; reconc@@ iled the Wag@@ n@@ eri@@ ans in Bayreuth
also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , Director Frank Cast@@ orf has set up a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ e st@@ aging with gigantic , six @-@ storey scenery .
the rotary platform ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows an im@@ plant@@ ing street corner with the wall and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pl@@ aste and El@@ aste &quot; logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
previously , an open Mercedes @-@ Old@@ timer , in which the Rhine is pos@@ thum@@ ed as a rock thr@@ ott@@ le , or alternatively a Is@@ etta .
rock barrels remin@@ is@@ cent of Cast@@ or@@ fs leit@@ motif - money , power and gre@@ ed - which draws its &quot; ring &quot; production through its &quot; ring &quot; production .
the three Rhein@@ iers - sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke L@@ ehm@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra Steiner - harmon@@ ise as already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold . &quot;
she dis@@ able them Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , r@@ ene in Hollywood @-@ man@@ ier a bar in the trunk and enter the Kra@@ wall@@ o @-@ Cli@@ que .
Stephen M@@ illing sings the del@@ ight@@ ful Hagen , which gives the au@@ ra of a heavy @-@ weight punching bag .
brutal the scene , when he performs Siegfried .
later also Gun@@ ther ( Mark Oak ) still needs to believe .
the audience than@@ ked the ensemble with powerful appl@@ ause .
the stor@@ my could be celebrated F@@ ost@@ er , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , which is modest and per@@ ver@@ ted hands to the Merkel surface .
there are large di@@ arr@@ he@@ a for the festival Orchestra , which shows the stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in Leg@@ erer .
the appearance was expected by Frank Cast@@ orf and his Regi@@ et@@ eam label .
in 2013 , he had to leave a g@@ av@@ el of the Pfei@@ fer &apos;s leading concert in 2013 , there were five years later , in which the united &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; t@@ ann@@ ons were interrupted .
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have enjoyed this .
&quot; one noted that the audience has grown together with the &quot; ring &quot; in a way she had said before the performance of the d@@ pa .
the audience did not only make a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it was also an understanding of how it has grown .
I draw a positive conclusion .
max quantity works as volunteers
they work in their volunte@@ er year at several locations .
where everywhere ?
amount : normally in stone furt in the furniture exchange , I will help in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge here .
and I &apos;ve worked at school in an open full day .
what are your experiences yet ?
quantity : it is a nice , wide spectrum I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with young refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years now , a late volunte@@ er volunte@@ er .
how does that come from ?
people : I made high school education .
and then a civil engineering study , say we are successful successfully .
I recognized the wrong thing for me and I want to make something different for me to work with people .
and then I asked me what do you do .
do a social year , there &apos;s an insight , there you can see how it may be , in the focal point perhaps , really is .
and was it so ?
amount : I &apos;ve collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social work in winter semester .
I am studying dual , do probably in the Youth Office Her@@ ne a social worker training and study at Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences in Ham@@ m .
is it not unusual to have several different applications during the volunte@@ er service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it is likely to be on where to make his FS@@ J .
it is possible to do it from the ages to youth - in all possible fac@@ ettes of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was partly in the O@@ gs , thus in the afternoon care .
for me it was the right thing that has rolled me .
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really runs .
other than in civil engineering study ?
quantity : well , here you will not expect to expect st@@ ati@@ ken .
one has always been a head of other people , each of which have a very different story behind .
whether a refugee , whether a youth , who has been collected from the family - one must always go on it .
very interesting .
and you had no contact case ?
people : I &apos;m not the type .
it is a range that gives a lot .
a lot of love , a lot of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but so that life is just enough .

the statement says that all the injured in a stable state are located and in the US military hospital on the Bag@@ ram Square .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a major concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide car flight at least 30 people killed in a residential district of Kabul .
the Taliban said they had executed these attack .
on May 31 , a massive bombar@@ d@@ ment in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest mil@@ it@@ ant attack in the country , since the US troops landed the Taliban in 2001 .
violence under@@ scores the pre@@ stige security situation in Afghanistan since US President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering the number of U.S. troops to support the military and the police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that the suicide attacks in Kabul in the last weeks have caused a crisis of public confidence in the government to have caused politics and particularly to the call of President Ash@@ raf Gh@@ ani .
EPA direct decision to delay the smo@@ g rule after Vel@@ agen
the U.S. Environmental Protection Authority has decided to delay a regulation of Obama administration , repe@@ aled which the states are required to em@@ bo@@ g smo@@ g @-@ created emissions . this was a day after 15 states accused the agency for the stri@@ de of the stri@@ de .
the EPA announced late in Wednesday the decision to drive the so @-@ called &quot; Oz@@ on@@ Rules 2015 &quot; and said , they show the obligation of the agency to work with states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in the dialogue with and hereby , that we react to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA CEO Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in June , P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of the EP@@ O , which should be measured in a part of the country &apos;s pollut@@ ant emissions to determine where inser@@ tions must be made to delay un@@ stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delayed one year until October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , together with the Colombia District of Colombia , filed an appeal on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to res@@ ili@@ ze a wide range of environmental regulations which led to the former President Barack Obama as part of a wider agenda that would boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump .
however , the efforts have triggered the set@@ back of the Democrats and nature groups that worry about the effects of larger emissions to public health .
the EPA &apos;s website says that the in@@ hal@@ ation of air , ozone does &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reduce lung function and strengthen respir@@ atory symptoms &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for example as@@ thma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Community in Community room
at the end , the decision was clear : in two counter@@ parts the Municipal Council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ ners appro@@ ve the establishment of a joint hall in the future senior residence .
before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the missing land part is signed , Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ ades reports .
although it is still going to take up until now the church community belonging to the community is now , there is no planning event for the project of a private investor .
there is a discussion concerning a shared space .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat , has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor it would have a living space of approximately 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with all 70 square meters of space available for a special price .
to administration and the majority of the Municipal Council , such a common room does not just look at the meeting point for the residents of sen@@ i@@ or@@ en@@ just living space , but open to the municipality .
as an example , the word of the Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; made the lap .
by means of funding , the decision that has been decided by means of funding for the current household already has been decided last autumn .
construction is located in the renovation area .
the facility of a shared space would have been reported as T@@ j@@ ades , with 60 percent of 30 percent .
the decision of the decision to sign@@ alize the investor , that in this regard , no bil@@ lets will throw between the legs , the determination of the saddle - what is reduced to ambient temperatures - as well as plaster @-@ height and construction cost - it would be possible .
unnecessary , so do not only Wil@@ fried S@@ oh@@ mer , be this addition .
if &apos;s helps : unanimously , it passes the panel .
it is not as easy as the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela B. refers to the many own buildings with which you do not get as well as the common room of the window , says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do it hard with that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ v@@ onne Sta@@ iger talks to the common room - however absolutely against a municipal participation .
it looks behind that a covered payout of oh@@ ours or even Foreign Invest@@ ors .
this is not the case , as with the acquisition of an area you don &apos;t give supplement , but get a real , in case of cas@@ u@@ alties , is the counter @-@ speech .
Sta@@ ig@@ ers &apos;s request to support the decisions correspon@@ d@@ ingly , finds three pon@@ ents .
so it remains in two counter@@ parts at the original program , which Stefan H@@ aller summar@@ ises : &quot; when we deal with the decision , we make a giant step to close a giant gap in our infrastructure . &quot;
coll@@ ision with car : Rad@@ ler is en@@ ligh@@ tened to street
at the Qu@@ ery of the street , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath was cap@@ sul@@ ated and severely viol@@ ated .

for the five defe@@ ats in the past six test games , An@@ cel@@ otti made the physical state and the missing balance in the game of his team .
&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical constitution , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , and added : &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team .
but this was not good . &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old has passed on to a performance in the first official mandatory race game of the season .
&quot; football is also tac@@ tic , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the crew is ready .
we want to play intelligent , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expected a &quot; difficult , intense play . &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German soccer heav@@ y@@ weights draws the fans into their b@@ ays .
the game is sold with 8@@ 1.@@ 360 people distributed to the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday .
in the resin of Stern hike to star
the nationwide first &quot; star path &quot; is alleged to emer@@ ge in the Harz mountains .
this is planning the Association of Stern@@ warte Saint Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planet trail in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star@@ ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is coming to the information needs of many har@@ lots , it was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star@@ ry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he connect nature , science , movement and sporty power .
the members want to place along the planned route boards and inform about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
in the first phase to 2018 the association is planning &quot; well @-@ reaching installations at five to six locations &quot; in the Ober@@ har@@ z .
in@@ question Che@@ ese St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ e@@ ge@@ i@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the tablets are to be complem@@ ented by the internet .
therefore , a good mobile network reception plays a role in the location selection .
also accessibility is a crit@@ erion .
later the star@@ ring train should be extended by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star@@ path you will learn the viewer worth knowing about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared the club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , they learned why stars had different colors or why a star stronger than another , even though he fly much more away .
thus , in which constellation can be found ( selected star ) and when he is best to see .
the association has already been operating in the mountain village of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg since 2014 , located at the highest mountain ob@@ servatory in Northern Germany .
the site in the middle of the national park has been according to the federal state of nature conservation for the six dar@@ k@@ est regions in Germany .
often there are from the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a galax@@ y with naked eye visible .
in the University of Cologne since 2003 there has been something similar to the planning of the Plan@@ et@@ arium in Göttingen since 2003 , like the planned death of the planet .
beginning before Geb@@ hardt Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet trail leads up to the Hain@@ berg and to the ob@@ servatory - as well as a &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden , with the Planet Sed@@ na .
the st@@ aves with the individual planets - including the d@@ warf @-@ plan@@ ed Pl@@ u@@ to at the end point - are precisely positioned in the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth sh@@ run@@ k so on a sphere of 6.5 mm in diameter while the sun measures 75 meters away , while the sun measures 70 centi@@ metres .
the total distance of the planet is just four kilometres .
while the light from Sun up to the Pl@@ u@@ to about eight hours are needed , pedestri@@ ans a good hour to St@@ ele with Pl@@ u@@ to .
pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the world all .
the march to the next fixing star would take a half a year .
Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o and Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia , who are in a coll@@ ision course to direct the most exciting pit combat in the near future , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN @-@ offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ proposed World boxing Council lightweight tool , the corridor down to Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o , the World boxing organization Super @-@ Feder@@ er Champion .
after Gar@@ ci@@ as victory through a @-@ part decision about the former Four @-@ Di@@ visions World Champions Adri@@ en Br@@ oner on Saturday at Show@@ time both fighter members are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und .
Gar@@ cia stretched out the right hand and said , &quot; How does it come to you , Champion ? &quot;
I wish you a lot of luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o def@@ ends his belt against Miguel , aga at 7 o &apos;clock on Saturday evening at 7 o &apos;clock .
when the pair of photos filed , Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o Manager Eg@@ is climate , noted that a possible show down between the cheese far would be the &quot; perfect magnitude . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m a former spring @-@ weight , &quot; rec@@ alled Gar@@ cia .
&quot; I have increased for Br@@ oner &#91; to 140 lbs &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big .
I &apos;m small for 140 .
I would like to go on light weight .
and he must move to light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then fight .
they demand the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o voted .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot;
climate asked whether it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ View , a part of a strategy , which has to fight Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o with a 135 pound debut in this year , in order to agree on the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their lightweight action battle in the forum on September 23rd .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this battle could take place in pay @-@ by @-@ View Mode because all fans asked him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia and pressed later openly to fight the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can produce this kind of attention .
when always they are ready ... &quot;
Gar@@ cia said he wrote Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o as a &quot; enormous fighter &quot; and will possibly participate in his Saturday battle .
but Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o said with a generous praise for Gar@@ cia , he said that he think the thre@@ ats champion from River@@ side are &quot; very slow , sorry Mik@@ ey ... you were seeking the Ko @-@ Aus . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said , the focus is , stroke strength , then boxes .
both said they could feel the Mom@@ entum that built up for his own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the battle that has to be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
I am more than happy to work with , &quot; said Gar@@ cia .
Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o said : &quot; I have been waiting for the top fighter and that &apos;s Mik@@ ey .
it will be a great struggle . &quot;
four last exp@@ ire after tire bur@@ z@@ zer
during an accident on the A7 , four people were seriously injured in the afternoon .
following the first information , the driver of a Opel Z@@ af@@ ira lost at 4.@@ 30 p.m. in front of the market place , presumably after a tire plat@@ ter , the control over his vehicle .
the passenger car was right to the right in the ar@@ qu@@ ake , where he survived , and then lying on the roof in the grave .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were seriously wounded in the accident .
during the first supply of the last through the ambul@@ ance service , A7 towards the north is closed for about one hour , then traffic on the left @-@ hand lap could be submitted to the accident .
Fort@@ y Hoffmann : &quot; turning chain works better &quot;
Andr@@ e Hoffmann is hop@@ ing for 2 : 2 at the season open@@ er to Braunschweig , making the optim@@ isation of the def@@ ences in Au@@ e points .
with the first season , Andr@@ e Hoffmann was pleased with the result , as they did not have the two opponents in the 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two opponents too much , and we have to watch even better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the defender of Fortuna Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Erz@@ gebirge , the Dre@@ aming chain should also be improved further .
and a gate after a Free Kick do not want to stir up their sur@@ f@@ ences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future it will be so that no more besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) will be on line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better right after the experience with the turning chain better than with the four @-@ chain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is his cause safe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we &apos;ve just set up the sem@@ iconductor chain in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko G@@ ie@@ ß@@ mann players who can build it well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; prer@@ equ@@ is@@ ite is , but , that we are even better harmon@@ ising and we are not to aff@@ ord so many off@@ play errors . &quot;
of course Hoffmann also goes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if one cannot speak after a mis@@ erable start , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the performance could well be okay , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we are able to concentrate on Sunday with four points and focus us on the poker , we will certainly talk of an ordinary season open@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of this , his trainer wanted nothing to know .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after six to eight gam@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el said only after six to eight days &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who doesn &apos;t want to speak of an advantage opposite to au@@ e , just because the game had to be demolished in Hei@@ den@@ heim for an accident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now they can begin the season virtually with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , that players from Au@@ e could possibly be a little bit of fresh , as they would not have a heavy and complete play such as Fortuna against a asc@@ ension way into the bones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know as 100 percent where they are currently standing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the inner man of Fortuna . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the Rhineland the guests go from the Rhineland as a lighter favorite on Sunday in the last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we take away , because we have the right to come under the first six , is Bl@@ ö@@ d@@ wise , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive at only a defeat against au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are no crew in the 2nd Bundesliga , which must be hit from the out@@ set , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fort@@ un@@ unas of the coach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one such statement would be ar@@ ro@@ gant and exc@@ essive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so , Funk@@ el wants to experience his players on Sunday in no way .
new Results of the Swedish asylum evaluation review published
the recent findings of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , showing a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested people have older than 18 years , but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authority for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( Ri@@ ber@@ n@@ al@@ em@@ et ) has started implementing the tests last year .
during the asylum procedure , they should take on the estim@@ ation of the age after the Swedish migration Authority ( Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ verk@@ et ) due to lack of correct age of some refugees who had been critic@@ ized for the years of age .
until today , mig@@ r@@ ations@@ He@@ et sent 6,@@ 880 to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results from a total of 2,@@ 481 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to July 31 , 2017 .
eigh@@ ty per cent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency ordered that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 432 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; might be under the age of 18 . &quot;
tests will only be carried out in cases where the age of the person is challenged .
according to Johan G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are resistant to last months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t see a great difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are pretty constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Local &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases referred to in the person as over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ ers has at his age .
in May , the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there were 4@@ 42 inst@@ ances that they propose that the subject was 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bl@@ a@@ det published the 5@@ 81 published results , it pointed out that in 243 of these cases the person said that they will be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age assessment , taken by the rays of wisdom of wisdom , and MRI images are analyzed , which then critic@@ ized by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , was also critic@@ ized in some areas .
a sk@@ ep@@ ti@@ cian Claude Marcus of Kar@@ ol@@ inska Institut , whose work is the assessment of biological maturity of people , to see if they were earlier or later than usually through the pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think that the type of measurement should be used .
to disc@@ ern biological age on this manner , is very un@@ certain .
if we cannot say it , we should not do so if we could it , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro .
G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of tests : &quot; in general , they can say that the risk of an adult is un@@ correct as an adult .
the greatest risk is in it if the person is under 18 , in this case this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in the plan
the work on the three bridges of Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are going well ahead .
on Wednesday , a seven tons of concrete concrete was installed at the bridge at the eastern town of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; we are very good at the time , it runs super , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , Building manager at the Department of Transport and Transport in the governmental sidi@@ um Freiburg .
at the same time , work began on all three san@@ itation @-@ needy bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building is fore@@ seen for October and is sure that the schedule will pause .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads through the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a wooden bridge in concrete , which is covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4,@@ 80 meters .
built in 1900 .
like the two other bridges , it is now come into the years .
to ensure the stability and traffic noise , the three buildings are thoroughly renovated .
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were erected in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 meters long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now been on Wednesday morning at the north side a 1,@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons heavy so @-@ called bridge fl@@ ap .
this is a base fortified , which is also used as a operating range .
on the southern part of the bridge the bridge should be mounted on a 2.@@ 20 meter wide bridge .
then the pedestrian street is then left .
the special thing is that there are finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented h@@ edge arms .
particular finger@@ tips has the laying of lines due to the structure in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a glass fibre cable where many firms are joined .
the residents were informed about the project by hand @-@ based on the project .
in addition , fish and canc@@ ers had to be f@@ ished .
traffic is controlled by a traffic light for the bridges between the building farm and the collective in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg .
for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ b@@ acher entrance , the street is locked in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den . &quot;
the cost of the three bridge consists of 700 000 euros .
the whole is financed by the land .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ under protest at German potato salad
it is not so frequently that parties move on a strand , but if it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , what else is difficult to bring with a hat .
the parties &quot; ( CDU , SPD , Grün@@ e , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Lin@@ ke ) belong to a wide alliance , that shows peace@@ fully flag in that day because the Af@@ D is in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle R@@ ond@@ ell , according to a poster &quot; big election cycle . &quot;
and known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land will compos@@ e the top duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the Deputy Chairman of the presi@@ ding Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are already at the beginning of the event will not want to listen to the Mand@@ al@@ ers , but demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot;
originally , the town @-@ pic@@ nic was planned under the motto &quot; All on a table &quot; at the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but now on the parking place below the rear of the rear - and in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a bun@@ ch image that offers you .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair@@ woman of the For@@ ums One World and one of the author@@ itative organis@@ ers , really pleased : &quot; great , how many people have joined here . &quot;
there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; a German potato sal@@ at that could easily eat the Af@@ D , &quot; says the woman who brought him .
the police ordered many civil servants to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , which shows presence especially at the railway station , just a few meters away from the venues .
how does the Af@@ D came to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes von der Af@@ rec@@ ei@@ fel reports , he ende@@ av@@ oured to get such a event and received the supplement .
the 45 year old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf initially sum@@ med up in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ ch not enough parking available .
so , the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ pes is looking forward that &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with a look at the event on the rear place he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of people , main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also does it : at about 20 o &apos;clock on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ pitch a band for entertainment , in the Stad@@ thalle of various speakers , among them the Rhineland @-@ pf@@ z@@ ische Af@@ D @-@ Chair@@ woman Uwe Young .
in the hall , there are about 200 list@@ eners that are waiting to wait for the German Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Deputy Chairman of the presi@@ ding Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
the police force remained unchanged , but so far the civil servants had a quiet evening .
something more than one hour takes the Af@@ D event , the guests on the court have a longer breath , but also there is just after 21 hours .
the police there are places - no special events .
trumpet meets trumpet
another listen to the Wolf@@ sem@@ an@@ ists Freder@@ ic Bell@@ i is available in the series Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ concerts tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 pm in the monastery church .
together with the Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea , &quot; or even &quot; Bal@@ kan@@ fol@@ klore &quot; hits a classic German training with roots in the bladder music .
both sol@@ o@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in European peak current musicians .
thus Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ ed at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic Bell@@ i is the SWR Symphony Orchestra .
both combines the lust , not only to exceed the bound@@ aries on their instruments , but also to merge the bound@@ aries of different gen@@ res .
so it sounds Johann Sebastian Bach at the two as in a new garment , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music &quot; with Bulgarian fol@@ klore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the Jazz@@ ech@@ op@@ re@@ ist@@ ern Nils W@@ ere , mix classic , jazz and the free games to an amazing complete art work .

Kri@@ sten Stewart Spe@@ aks over her bis@@ exual
&quot; some people love gr@@ illed cheese and will eat it until the end of her life .
but I want to try everything , &quot; so Kri@@ sten Stewart is quite open on its bis@@ exual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I want to add to gr@@ illed cheese , I think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh that was cool , what comes next to next ? &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood star was the to her &quot; tw@@ il@@ ight &quot; -@@ colleagues Robert Patt@@ inson , who finally went out bitter .
despite all the insured the Brün@@ ette Dar@@ stell@@ o said to the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was in serious about any seriously , whom I heard .
or do you believe me , I have played it ? &quot;
according to their separation , det@@ est evidence that they were bis@@ exual , &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed on the du@@ alism .
so it has never been conf@@ used or disabled .
I just never liked it , not serious . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ang show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in the school time , she rather than one bush : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all the girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this really has really hurt me .
when I was eleven , I told me the children , I would look like a b@@ b .
I really felt attacked , anxi@@ ety and damaged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think it : &apos; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the public they don &apos;t like to live their love : &quot; people expect you relatively a way , and do you off@@ end me .
and perhaps some of me t@@ ank@@ le , but I don &apos;t like it to just@@ ify me in front of the public . &quot;
Virginia Govern@@ or of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
the democratic Govern@@ or of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday night with a demonstration with President Tr@@ ump , that he will change the party .
whether you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; said Govern@@ or Justice .
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and much re@@ thinking ... today I will tell you about West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I &apos;m a democratic Govern@@ or . &quot;
the manifest@@ ation broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the rep@@ ublic@@ ans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Justice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a coach I would say that it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised before a big announcement at the West Virginia Rallye .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice not endor@@ sed the democratic candidate in Hill@@ ary Clinton .
Justice , according to Forbes of the only billi@@ on@@ aire in state , was elected in 2016 .
Forbes is certain that he has treated carbon@@ em@@ ines in five States , and has inher@@ ited the carbon business from his father .
it is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee held a statement on Thursday evening in which it said : &quot; the party change of Govern@@ or Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party that would rather be doing rather than to work for our land . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 villages and the control of the least physical bodies in history , the announcement of Govern@@ or Justice is only the last re@@ jection of a party which is not able to find a positive , certificates message , &quot; said R@@ NC Mc@@ Daniel in a declaration made by C@@ BS News .
CO@@ E lo@@ aves &quot; hon@@ our@@ able Russian exc@@ use for d@@ oping sc@@ and@@ al
the worldwide boss of athlet@@ ics , Sebastian Co@@ e , pra@@ ising on Thursday what he described as obvious exc@@ use from Russia to a d@@ oping sc@@ and@@ al , but he repeated , it is not the moment for the country to be entered again in the sport .
Russia &apos;s athlet@@ ics chef D@@ mit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ ac@@ ht@@ in told the eve of the athlet@@ ics World Championships on the eve of the athlet@@ ics World Championships that the ban of his country was correct from the sport and that he was determined to fight the d@@ oping .
he said it was sorry for &quot; all athletes who were cut off cont@@ ests in competitions gold and silver medals . &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress approved for maintaining the prohib@@ its in November 2015 , after a report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) on state @-@ sponsored d@@ oping in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer , a very hon@@ our@@ able presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF @-@ President Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the entire Council and the entire congress were that the Russian Federation has experienced in itself , that they have experienced some rather hot times and everything possible to ensure that the Federation is redesigned . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; CO@@ E said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is also pleased &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia will accept the criteria for his re @-@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constru@@ ctive day , and I think that progress has been achieved but the congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force , that this is not the moment to use Russia , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must do everything in the next months to norm@@ alize these situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gui@@ ding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the dep@@ ended system , &quot; he added
ninet@@ een Russian athletes are competing in the World Athlet@@ ics World Championships , which begin on Friday in London to compete for the rig@@ orous IA@@ AF criteria .
the head of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must still meet some of the criteria for a re@@ setting .
drug tests are still in@@ adequate and forbidden , are still working free , he said Rep@@ orters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council .
fun@@ eral service for Mali had crashed into Mali
during a fun@@ eral service in the northern hemisphere , around 1000 people of the two were killed with a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral town under high security standards .
the Minister of Defence , Urs@@ ula of the Ley@@ en ( CDU ) , did not yet exist .
they awarded the two lost pilots , but as &quot; skill of their expertise . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow before this highest sacrifice , which they have completed in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 year old Major and 47 @-@ year @-@ old Chief of Staff of Nord@@ h@@ essen had come live on Wednesday a week in the West African Mali .
their s@@ coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and transferred to Sankt Peter on Thursday with a total guard of the Bundes@@ wehr in the Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er Dom Saint Peter .
at noon on the south , only the relatives found in the Church Ab@@ schied .
thereafter , the fun@@ eral service of the family , closest friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and Politics .
there were also H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CDU ) and the general inspec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
they threw Roses the rose , and the arms were arm in arm .
in front of the church Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
the Minister of Defence from the Ley@@ en , awarded the converted soldiers as &quot; highly decorated &quot; and mar@@ gar@@ te .
the Chief Apostle captain had been the flight operation of the fighter @-@ helicopter Tiger in Fr@@ itz@@ lar with one of the first six exhibited tiger drivers of his reg@@ im@@ ents .
Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , Kom@@ man@@ de@@ ur of Reg@@ iment , said : &quot; if this crew could not turn the crash , there would not be mo@@ cked . &quot;
doub@@ ts on the UN mission in Mali showed no doubt from Ley@@ en &apos;s Ley@@ en : the application is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he was also of great importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a land which we only separated by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the fun@@ eral service , the coff@@ ins were brought from the cathedral .
when and where they buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not contain any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik does not want a grave beside his wife
the man of the Danish queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried after his wife .
this divided the King &apos;s house on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple was buried in the cathedral of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ø@@ r@@ n N@@ ø@@ r@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for the two .
the queen be understood with the decision of their husband , and it was also in the communication .
where Prince Hen@@ rik will be buried , be un@@ clear .
but he didn &apos;t have the intention to be buried in his French hom@@ eland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a H@@ ehl out that he was not happy with his title .
after the thr@@ ott@@ oman of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would like to become king .
in 2016 he retired from reti@@ re and covers the title &quot; prin@@ cess@@ ahl . &quot;
since Hen@@ rik has not received the title and the function which he wanted to see himself across his wife - not even after death , declared L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by , the leader in the Danish king &apos;s house .
finally , where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will eventually be un@@ clear .
but he did not have the intention to be buried in his French hom@@ eland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he worked in the last 50 years .
the born Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French no@@ blem@@ en , had learned Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London .
at the Th@@ ames he worked in the French Embassy .
during his future woman , the sympath@@ y of the people always wor@@ shi@@ ped , Prince Hen@@ rik had a strong stand for the Dan@@ es in his nearly 50 years .
in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik reigned over the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did .
my Danish was fluctu@@ ating , I preferred wine instead of beer , so@@ aps instead of Stri@@ ck@@ so@@ cks , Citroën instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia tobacco , and this could have been able to have the reputation , the brand &apos;s companion of intellec@@ tu@@ als , I could not hope to see .
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed .
that &apos;s equal two mist@@ akes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Weil wants to be re @-@ election
CDU and F@@ DP in front of the possible majority in Lower Saxony
defe@@ ating Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) , after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a rapid re@@ election of the country , he does not want to re@@ sign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dis@@ solution of the Parliament &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , in Lower Saxony the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in Lower Saxony .
five months before the official appointment of the Parliament election the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its kn@@ itted one @-@ votes majority in parliament to the opposition from CDU and F@@ DP .
in their election with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in Rot@@ enburg in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ üm@@ me ) , founded their last step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination .
&quot; I see my political future in the CDU , &quot; explained on Friday in Hannover on Friday .
CDU @-@ Group leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ üm@@ ler wants to recommend it to his Group to record it .
thus CDU and F@@ DP had together 69 seats in Lower Saxony , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far the reverse was vice versa .
the new State Parliament will be elected regular on 14th January next year .
Th@@ ings@@ ler said that red @-@ green state government must now decide whether to reg@@ ain any majority in this situation .
Stephan Weil therefore holds indisp@@ ens@@ able for indisp@@ ens@@ able that the day of the Parliament will resol@@ ve his self @-@ resolution .
the CDU faction will probably decide on Tuesday through its more presentation .
the state of the state will also see the possibility that the Parliament elec@@ ts trust the trust and elec@@ ts a successor .
&quot; our Constitution offers several options .
these ways must be legally checked , &quot; said Th@@ ys@@ ler said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will be able to expos@@ e any questions if they are legally checked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Th@@ ings@@ ler called the &apos; West Point step &quot; but somewhat cur@@ i@@ os . &quot;
the policies itself stressed : &quot; I am no tra@@ itors .
I feel very good . &quot;
it referred to as a viol@@ inist from black @-@ green .
the Green called the ab@@ duc@@ ted pu@@ ties on the return of their country tour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are of course that she has received the country &apos;s country with immediate effect &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; having immediate effect &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Govern@@ or Meta Janssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Group president of the Green An@@ ja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we regre@@ t the decision by El@@ ke T@@ li@@ ft . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she deliber@@ ately decided to lead no partition in the faction .
&quot; even before the background , there was no in@@ durable differences , we cannot re@@ prove this step . &quot;
German Social Democratic candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the opposition of the Lower Saxony @-@ MPs El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets on the CDU as a betra@@ y@@ al .
&quot; the behaviour of the former Green @-@ MPs in Lower Saxony is not only to betra@@ yers to the voters , but also to red @-@ green , &quot; the B@@ und@@ esch@@ ef &quot; wrote on Friday at Facebook .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) to re @-@ choose the Parliament soon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Australian tonn@@ age costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony for the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the policy of politics &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in its last E@@ it@@ el@@ iness and her Fr@@ ust their personal interests in front of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised SPD Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ and@@ al that the CDU in Lower Saxony did not make this dirty bank@@ roll and tried to strike through political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dutch investig@@ ative CDU @-@ president Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ üm@@ ler wants to share its members to record El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets in the CDU .
the Group leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , designed T@@ jack@@ ets to refuse the result of the 2013 Parliament election .
the CDU was then the strongest force in the SPD , SPD and green , but they had a small majority vote in the Parliament in the country .
Minister for Agriculture in an interview - How do we protect ourselves from gi@@ ft@@ ly , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany disc@@ usses about w@@ asted eggs .
how was the sc@@ and@@ al pass ?
how can consumer protect themselves .
Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) was an interview with the editorial team of Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr Schmidt , how can the consumer protect eggs from po@@ is@@ oned eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumer products and consumer to check the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp pressure .
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ grocery war@@ n@@ un@@ .de , the Länder are the most recent news about the affected Eg@@ gs .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if after all we currently know , a health haz@@ ard is virtually impossible .
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs from the offer - because the central role of the re@@ conn@@ aissance of the Federal Minister is not really true ?
the food monitoring is the role of the Länder .
nevertheless , my home has immediately opened immediately and has since been dis@@ closure of Germany &apos;s involvement in tight exchange with the authorities of the countries .
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
the trade has the same as the manufacturer to ensure that the sold products are market@@ able and health @-@ harmful .
if in case of eggs the residual level of 0.0@@ 0.000@@ 5 mg / kg exceeded , these are not traffic .
un@@ loaded eggs can , however , can be sold and consumed .
this time the business is not bl@@ ame .
are production plants and consumers in the same boat ?
after the process level , the production plants meets no immediate debt .
however , it must not be liable to potentially harmful practices of services companies with economic damages .
as always there is too little control over the harvest .
is it only missing on the personnel or also at the con@@ clusive jurisdiction ?
it was just the official controls that have uncovered the process .
however , the truth also belongs that food items and criminal energy may never be impossible to be 100 percent .
this is just a consistent adv@@ ancement of such events and the hand@@ over to the prosecutor in cases where criminal off@@ ences can be crucial .
I have already made a number of several times that I expect from the responsible authorities to have a rec@@ ess re@@ conn@@ aissance statement .
is the regular alarm algorithm really needed for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
consumer consumers and consumers have the right to get solely secure and market@@ able food .
if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ de in food industry is used , consumers and consumers are righ@@ tly distur@@ bed .
by the imp@@ anz@@ ee means , manufacturers , dealers and consumers are not involved in a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
basically , it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ ds Fi@@ pron@@ il should not be acceptable and must be completed immediately .
it has to be consistently al@@ igned with high pressure on all levels .
I expect from all competent authorities to clari@@ fy the atomic fact that the atomic fact is resolved .
how the financial rules of football on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules agreed on to prevent incorrect spending of the European football clubs , N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spain Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain are not inter@@ fer@@ ed .
any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Germain for the UEFA Cup , because the leading organization that monitors the European game monitors the power to negoti@@ ate teams of access to the prestigious champ@@ ions Champions League tournament .
financial Fair @-@ Play rules that were launched in 2011 by the UEFA Cup mean that PS@@ G has to prove that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without large losses .
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million $ ) to buy Bras@@ ili@@ aner from his contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar is received a salary which will amount to several ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
PS@@ G can make money to loose with security , so N@@ ey@@ mar teach and it into a galax@@ y other stars , in view of the financing of the team through the energy rich Herr@@ scher@@ family of Qatar .
associations may apply much money for the acquisition of players much money , but have to control the break @-@ even point in their hands @-@ related business to them .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini to his election to the UEFA president in 2007 .
the former French player believed that there was an enormous debt , effectively in their quest for success , effectively fr@@ au@@ dul@@ ent and ris@@ ky , to ru@@ in@@ ct , if banks or owners back their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P decreased from the concentration to the debts of the clubs on the monitoring of their losses .
the change meant that the business model used for Roman Ab@@ ram@@ ovi@@ ch originally used in Chelsea - a club with potential and then invested heavily in order to build the crew and build a global brand - to a tough@@ er matter .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P research period which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses of 30 million euros .
and even though Plat@@ ini has fallen from the presi@@ dency in 2015 , his UEFA successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to make a lot of spending money .
&quot; surely , FF@@ P is not dead and we will intensi@@ fy the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the FF@@ P , opposite The Associated Press in the past week .
although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out Kl@@ au@@ sel from N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , it can distribute the amount of the invoice by the duration of its contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the trigger sum will be issued for the next five years in the amount of 4@@ 4.4 million euros in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has launched the PS@@ G along with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( then 82 million dollars ) , which later lowered to € 20 million - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players , which will be limited to normal 25 players otherwise .
the UEFA is in search of clubs that could try to over@@ look their financial vision by combining their income by companies that are associated with owners of a club .
while a cat@@ aract company could not exceed the PS@@ G , if the value of the Spon@@ sor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , the UEFA this would not apply as a legitim@@ ate e @-@ income .
this happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of the Spon@@ sor@@ ings of the PSA Tourism Department Authority was stopped .
it was reported that a part of PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar would come to Qatar for payments by the World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar will have fought that N@@ ey@@ mar World amb@@ ass@@ adors will simply be able to find out a der@@ ive man@@ oeu@@ vre for the UEFA Reg@@ ulators authorities .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEFA is still atten@@ tive to observe any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
the UEFA had no pre @-@ preparing talks with PS@@ G via N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the condition of an@@ a@@ ym@@ ity with The Associated Press , since they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 generated sales of EUR 54@@ 2.4 million and generated a profit of more than € 10 million .
accounts for the last fiscal year must be published .
PS@@ G expects that N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival is a blessing for Spon@@ sor@@ ing deal , mer@@ chan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot sales .
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after signing the signature .
the Spanish league was definitely irrit@@ ated , one of the best football players going to see , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Weg@@ ener saying that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial d@@ oping &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in regards to Kat@@ ars the final owner of PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Arsenal @-@ Manager Ar@@ sene W@@ enger , whose club is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , divi@@ des the reservations of La League against a state to finance an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the owner and this has changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ enger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once a country owns a club everything is possible .
it is very difficult to respect the Fin@@ anzi@@ elle Fair@@ play because you can have different ways or different interests , if a country has such a major player to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is delivered to the search for a new fine @-@ gil@@ ding
in the past years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y has produced chocolate @-@ chocolate for the Swiss Life .
now the s@@ orts of cooperation is before a possible end : the airline writes the order now .
Swiss @-@ spokes@@ person Mei@@ ke Fu@@ sch@@ rott confirmed on request of the news agency S@@ DA a report published by the newspaper &quot; Northwest Switzerland &quot; from Friday .
according to current planning , the airline will conclu@@ de a new contract during the first half of 2018 .
the products were reviewed and subjected to a quality control every two to three years .
&quot; with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y we are very satisfied , &quot; said the spokes@@ person .
some 17 million small red @-@ lam@@ inated boards of up to 14 grams distributed each year in front of the landing to the passengers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the cost , the Swiss Life wanted no information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
industry artists estimate the volume of a volume of &quot; Northern Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around 1 billion Swiss francs .
but more important is all the advertising effect : for a Sch@@ og@@ gi@@ producer , it is a pre@@ stige mission .
as many applicants in the new call , the Swiss Life will not be betrayed .
but in question only Swiss manufacturers come .
according to the newspaper article Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to move a renewal of the Treaty establishing spring 2018 .
for the S@@ DA , the largest Swiss chocolate producer was not accessible for a statement .
cho@@ col@@ ates distri@@ butes the Swiss Life since 2006 on board its flights .
before the Swiss signed a contract with the Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut plant in cooperation with h@@ ug the chocolate tablets .
the possibility to place the logo , introduced Swiss two and a half years ago with the start of collaboration with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers .
on long @-@ hau@@ gh@@ ters , customers of the first class with le@@ ak@@ erie j@@ ump@@ bs are spo@@ iled in business class n@@ og@@ gi passengers of Lin@@ dt and the Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the short route , Swiss Sch@@ og@@ gi of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , also distributed in business as well as in Economy Class .

it makes very much fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rud@@ d , the Matt D@@ ill@@ ons under@@ li@@ pp@@ enb@@ art of &quot; singles &quot; shows , whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old h@@ acker .
there are the moments of acci@@ dental w@@ ahn@@ wei@@ ns that this fran@@ chise could take place like a sort of repet@@ itive conclusion : &quot; W@@ ET Hot American Summer : twenty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the Ban@@ de as they will visit the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon now rec@@ alls another type of nost@@ al@@ gia : to revi@@ ve the revival of the Cold War &quot; and even to &quot; G@@ low &quot; with its East @-@ to @-@ West w@@ rest@@ ling @-@ icon@@ ography .
the com@@ edy by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka had been a director with R@@ hy@@ s Thomas as director , a lively drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , who fight for truth , ath@@ e@@ ism and the way of Marx@@ ism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard slave , and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose dial@@ ogs of Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt is to be synchron@@ ized in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some beautiful tracks to see ( the police ret@@ ains the time to watch chess on TV , as Americans may do it with football ) .

&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; which was converted to a lower length could be better , since Gregory and I@@ os@@ ef always return the American Embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick males , who disappeared a cluster of Hamburg .
the message for the imag@@ inary public audience is that the Western culture can do everything for food .
the fic@@ tive Romanian Maker were not wrong : we do it even with our own younger history and with the ih@@ anna .
blow against drugs m@@ af@@ ia in the country
the police had a blow against the Italian Mafia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , in the Black Forest @-@ Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Konstan@@ z , Esslingen and Stuttgart were searching for numerous objects , as the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Public Prosecutor dropped on Friday .
between 25 years and 77 years , he was arrested and issued warran@@ ts issued by arrest in 77 years .
in addition , the officials provided large amounts of mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms as well as several hundred thousand Euros .
at the same Raz@@ or in Italy two persons were arrested .
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects .
the two are probably shipped to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the action .
in total , more than 300 polic@@ emen were employed .
members of the m@@ af@@ ia will be accused of drug criminal , severe violence , conce@@ aled murder as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and v@@ ex@@ ation .
already in the summer of 2016 , the public prosecutor &apos;s office determines the organised drug trade in the southern German room .
between the Heads of State in Konstan@@ z and Palermo was a recur@@ ger exchange and the investig@@ ator of Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
this was therefore accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning .
in addition to the Italian m@@ af@@ ia , Italian national nationals combined with respect to Italian m@@ af@@ ia .
also a di@@ arr@@ he@@ a on the 27th of May , in the early morning several shots were fired up into a restaurant , the Bank &apos;s account is likely to go into account .
way compl@@ ying great g@@ aps in the fore@@ igner @-@ register
&quot; data from citizens who should not appear &quot; : according to a report , the foreigners register has significant short@@ com@@ ings in Germany .
the lead to partly gra@@ ving mis@@ decisions in case of asylum procedures .
the Commissioner for refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has made aware of a media report according to large g@@ aps in the country &apos;s country register .
defic@@ ien@@ cies of the most registered data might result in the case of asylum procedures and deportation operations , &quot; in an analysis that lies the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; in an analysis .
according to the register , ten million people with foreign nationality are recorded , including about 5.7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data is therefore managed by some 600 foreign authorities in Germany .
because the data has not been well maintained , the data quality in parts have not been good so far .
in individual accidents , data from 1921 have been found , &quot; by people who are not longer than life , or of citizens who are German citizens , and actually no longer should appear in the register . &quot;
&quot; def@@ ective data indicates that return processes can be slow down , &quot; it is stated according to the report .
in the statistics on immig@@ ration people , the EU citizens ruled that they would not have to travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , such false leaders led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to a dist@@ ressed debate about dealing with out@@ going lights , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore it is therefore in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the Federal Government revealed that refugee families with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children had to return to Italy if they entered from there .
this will go out from an internal paper on the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( B@@ AM@@ F ) , the &quot; New O@@ B @-@ back@@ er Zeitung comments . &quot;
according to the paper , the B@@ AM@@ F will conduct such methods regarding families with children , with the exception of infants and infants - according to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 , the newspaper was no longer able to check the newspaper under reference to the difficult situation .
after the Dublin agreement , it is responsible for refugees in the EU state , which they first reach first .
when a mig@@ rant travels to another EU country , this state may send him back into the country .
in order to write the ministry : &quot; now the admission capacity for families with minor children has increased considerably in Italy . &quot;
Italy I submitted for the recording and accommodation of families guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) keep these comm@@ it@@ ments for sufficient .
other EU states also would send refugees to the Dublin Wel@@ fare zone .
the internal political spokes@@ woman of the parliamentary committee in the Bundestag , Ul@@ la Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children , because of the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system human rights conditions and a end@@ anger@@ ment of child abuse . &quot;

the Bank of England will hold down interest rates at 0.25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce that the interest rates remain unchanged , after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened the spec@@ ulation about a rise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will remain when she held the interest rates on family income in the middle of an increased pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s political decision @-@ makers of the Bank ( M@@ PC ) voted with 6 to 2 to hold the interest rates to 0.25 % , with a slight increase in this month , as the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase .
in its fourth annual inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 at 1.6 % and after that the pressure on bud@@ get@@ ary will continue , whereas inflation in autumn expected to rise to just under 3 % .
but they were sign@@ alized that in the next few years , interest rate would be necessary to gre@@ ased the inflation of the Bre@@ x@@ it , and she said that the credit costs may increase more than expected at the financial markets .
the members agreed to withdraw a part of the mamm@@ oth economy package that was issued a year after Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will require time for the financing plan to provide a budget for banks , although it is said that they will be able to provide 15 billion pounds more in the context of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling silver .
a few minutes after the decision on the interest rate the Bank said : &quot; in the central progn@@ osis of the M@@ PC , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak , since the pressure on the real income of households still imp@@ lies consumption . &quot;
in addition to the interest of interest , it repeated that &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy challenges &quot; for cooling the inflation and a &quot; somewhat bigger &quot; magnitude would be required than the markets are expected .
markets were currently projected to increase the first rise in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank emphas@@ ized that increases &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; progressi@@ vely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank forecast down@@ wards adjusted for this and next year , 1.9 % , and 1.7 % in comparison to the revised growth forecast down@@ wards .
it ret@@ ains its growth forecast for 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell to those messages from the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0,5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1,@@ 11 euros .
the decision to no change occurs after the youngest dis@@ appo@@ inting growth figures rising the increasing expectations to an interest rate and the GDP in the second quarter increased from 0.2 % to 0.3 % in the previous three months .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it is slightly slo@@ gan@@ s at the end of the year .
the most recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households that will be affected by a rising inflation and slightly lower sal@@ aries , since the deep@@ ening of first even worse before being repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy cannot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent it in the next few years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she added that wages towards the end of their three @-@ year forecast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also strengthened by rising demand for British goods , which is due to the weak Po@@ unds , which is part of the lower consumer expenditure .
the decision is one year after lowering of interest rates to 0.25 % in the last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ king &apos;s sin@@ king .
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will reach the prices and the economy .
before the last judgment of the Bank on interest rates , the call was increased after an interest rate , since the inflation rose to hard @-@ pushed households , with three political decision @-@ makers in July an increase to 0.5 % .
inflation has fallen in the past month from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % , although the Bank said that this was expected to come back in the coming months .
the Bank said , its aims at the ratio to their goal of 2 % is &quot; quite &quot; to the weak Po@@ unds .
Andrew Mont@@ esc@@ ort , director at Co@@ rec@@ o Mort@@ al Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the shortened return of the s@@ wap rate , the mort@@ g@@ ages market is likely to be stronger competitive , since the lending desk would be looking sharp@@ ly to shops and to termin@@ ate the year in a positive way .
the market is particularly good for those where the existing deal will exp@@ ire and un@@ lock the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) is to run the controversi@@ al HIV @-@ drug 10.000 people
from September after a fight before the High Court against financing of the drug in N@@ HS , patients will receive access to a &quot; transformed &quot; HIV pre@@ ven@@ eration treatment .
N@@ HS England announced that one before sexual intercourse recorded pre@@ ex@@ positi@@ onal hy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) , which can reduce the risk of infection with risk risk by around 86 percent , is now supplied by the health service on a first three @-@ year study for an estimated 10,000 people .
he was willing to finance the trial after the Court of Appeal confirmed a ruling of the Supreme Court under which the N@@ HS had confirmed the powers that the local authorities should finance him in spite of the claims that local authorities should finance him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he was announced on Thursday , was announced by N@@ HS England @-@ boss Simon Stev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the National AIDS Trust ( NAT ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decisive moment &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Brigh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be the first one who will enable the registration of people , and other clinics will follow in October , before it will be introduced to the whole of England in April 2018 .
pre@@ ex@@ positi@@ onal hy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) is a result of HIV preparations taken before having sex in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP significantly reduced the HIV @-@ transmission in the risk of infection .
Pr@@ EP before sexual intercourse means that only enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such medicines can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse .
to those who come to question , weak@@ ens or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and persons with HIV @-@ positive partners that were not successfully treated .
in clinics , suitable participants will be identified who agree to the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known as anti @-@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment .
people who live in England and registered with a veter@@ in@@ arian , can also register for possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program is valued at £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for the delivery of the medicine in this week after an international competitive proc@@ urement .
the study aims to assess the entire potential of Pr@@ EP by evalu@@ ating clinical evidence as it is applied specifically and implemented in large scale .
Stev@@ ens said , &quot; This great intervention should become the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts on the prevention of HIV .
it is a further milestone in which more than three decades continued adv@@ ances in awareness of one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot;
Deb@@ orah Gold , Chief Executive of the NAT ( National AIDS Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV .
Pr@@ ison , if specifically targeted and end@@ anger@@ ed people , the possibility to change the English HIV epidemic .
from September to people with high HIV risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ financed an attempt in England to develop a new instrument and is not subject to a negoti@@ ation with a partner , which leads to the improvement of many many lives .
we welcome you all this announcement . &quot;
Ian Green , Chairman of the Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority must now be carried out that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one has left the risk for HIV .
now , since the Pr@@ EP @-@ Test Medicine was created , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 infected people infected people . &quot;
Sharon Hod@@ g@@ son , Sh@@ adows @-@ health Minister , said : &quot; the beginning of the Pr@@ EP process is welcome to months after months of del@@ ays and rel@@ ays to the government .
the evidence show how transformed this drug as part of our approach to HIV @-@ prevention and finish the transfer of this vital infection .
this attempt takes us a step closer to the understanding of the benefits of Pr@@ EP .
now it is important that this study is carried out as fast as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV @-@ infected , and that they are going to contribute to the end of the distribution of HIV in society by step closer . &quot;
the big life live : mezzanine and clever designers tricks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a generous home
Jo@@ anne L@@ eig@@ h , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , was reduced from a large house in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment in 2014 .
it is situated on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed its bags and sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before I lived with my Ex in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much bigger area , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I searched for something that was comparable to my prize .
I have shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and it had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have in love with them and made a special offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first tour the 1,000 square foot has been completely overhau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ bedroom property with a bent layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add the reservoir and a mezzanine to optimally use the spacious ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
this was my request , &quot; says it .
for this purpose she has assigned the architecture and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Notting Hill , to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and to make a home not only a development but also a place to life for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two spaces over each other , so that the architectural challenge of it was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to be creative to solve the prec@@ urs@@ ing .
&quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms that they were stack@@ ed into each other , without having to g@@ aps ourselves .
it wasn &apos;t just about to build a simple platform , but the steel that he asked for the function up or below the right height . &quot;
this arrangement enabled the fan to place two spaces in full height - with a lot of additional Drama .
a classic copper light windows of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us can look down over the gl@@ am@@ ous living area .
mir@@ ro@@ red gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting stand the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role when adding theater , space and light .
on both ends , a short corridor is mir@@ ro@@ red to leave it longer .
in the kitchen , the mirror feels like a window in another room .
at the entrance we offer space for all the bri@@ dging and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
thanks to perception of a gl@@ am@@ our@@ able space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .
folded kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of engineering &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; went in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pro@@ fan of the steel reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important so that if you sh@@ ove the door , very easy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the cle@@ ver@@ able use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne was able to gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the day you will sell your base area - or as your property is estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ary form a real estate agent will occur and will perform a calculation based on the floor size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they made it to enlarge the floor space and use high @-@ quality materials that make the room his luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are things that you touch and help them to create a emotional engagement in a home &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t love yourself into the electrical sockets in walls .
they are important , but they are not playing with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be converted by a good design and elevated square met@@ a of something standard in something quite amazing .
in fact , as Jo@@ anne , you might choose to leave this not .
brothers fighting for a $ 500 million US dollar empire
two brothers have four decades , after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a meditation because of one of the largest real estate markets Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as worth over $ 500 million .
the former Director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developers Colin De Lut@@ is lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . this has brought him to the Supreme Court to clari@@ fy how their property and their business is to be divided .
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family since 2014 , but a sharp con@@ front@@ ation about the separation finds in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , brothers 38 have collected 38 properties worth over half a billion dollars , and since the family purchased a business in the Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
the West@@ co Je@@ ans family founded there and grew up to a chain of 160 retailers .
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lut@@ is now covers offices in the city rum , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centres in the suburbs .
according to an agreement with her de@@ ceased father , Colin - was described by Paul as &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lut@@ is family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul approximately one @-@ third .
a judicial states that this means that Colin property has valued at $ 316 million and Paul in the value of 176 million dollars .
the distribution of real estate and cash has proved for Paul as Pro@@ ble@@ eding point .
&quot; by Colin proposed essays have left him with his left , what I kept for the best properties , &quot; he wrote in 2015 in an initial aff@@ id@@ av@@ it .
last Friday , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place last Friday .
the brothers now fight for control of existing business - Colin , as Paul claims to be excluded .
Colin argu@@ ed , this is not true , but th@@ rows Paul before , to manage some poss@@ essions .
in an early aff@@ id@@ av@@ it that was filed by Colin , he says he hope to en@@ fair the dispute .
&quot; my Italian legacy is that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote .
the cost increases in the case involving hundreds of pages with aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , among them Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both sides have been awarded law firm .
wife De Lut@@ is and her late husband Luigi were Italian immig@@ rants , the dairy bars and delic@@ acy business from the late 1950 @-@ s and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick .
they used the security of buying the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property , in which Colin opened the first Je@@ ans@@ ing of the Family .
Colin says that he began to be West@@ co in West@@ co , when he was one of the high school in my last years , when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) .
Anna De Lut@@ is said that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hop@@ ed to continue their property to her sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi told me that he never wanted to land that the brothers left the court , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lut@@ is Group , with Colin claims that Mark had paid $ 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark are , Paul &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Paul &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Colin has kept himself very back , although he was a former AF@@ L member , and after a biography from Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire of the best friend of television .
Fair@@ fax Media took her contact with Colin and Paul De Lut@@ is and her lawyer &apos;s contact .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Colin responded by SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say much &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the fall is before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very , very sad , that my brother Paul has decided to acc@@ use me and to draw our family names by the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Colin wrote in a letter to the judgment that he tried to meet the demands of his brother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not desire that Paul and I would say in our current battle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope to have a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday these hope appeared to be over .
&quot; our matter will be solved in the near future of the courts , &quot; wrote Colin .
Tr@@ um@@ ps appointed a new Chief of Staff to restri@@ ct the media coverage of the President .
others have tried and are failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if yes , he will be the first .
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO claims that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to restri@@ ct the information flow on President Tr@@ ump - including reports of the news media - in hope to keep the boss on an even higher course .
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h Daw@@ sey :
when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , said to his first working day with leading employees , he set up a main problem in President Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps White House which he would like : bad information that would come into the hands of the President .
Kelly said the staff that information should flow through him - whether on paper or in writing , because the President would meet better decisions when he would receive good information . &quot;
wa@@ it@@ ys diagnostic makes sense , but others have tried to nar@@ row@@ ate Tr@@ ump by monitoring its media management .
President Tr@@ um@@ ps relationship is enough to go to television for decades - and now , where he is in the White House , its TV advertising is still strong .
&quot; when Tr@@ ump was cancelled due to un@@ fair coverage , it was productive to show him that he was a fair coverage of places that were to convince , &quot; said the former election advis@@ er Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February opposite PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO .
Polit@@ ic@@ os Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key to hold tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter hab@@ it under control , according to six former campaign civil servants there is to ensure that his personal media consumption contains a ste@@ ady lob@@ ster prize . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter hab@@ it ever &quot; was under control , is ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous .
perhaps this campaigns could not know what we don &apos;t know that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twe@@ ets could not contain more ignition material without their inter@@ ventions .
we probably will never experience anything about the twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump does not have .
if his employees create it , some times were able to keep trouble by him , then his efforts have been worth it .
but no one has consistently preventing it , that Tr@@ ump &apos;s controversi@@ es appear .
a part of the problem exists that people are involved in a White House which deals with competing parties , always trying to present their own agenda by bringing them of Tr@@ ump material , which may potentially enhance their views from the world .
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO - deals with this story - reported on the pre@@ ference of advis@@ ors , President of strategic reasons , doub@@ ting for strategic reasons .
this was an example that was described by re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tr@@ ump leaders say that Tr@@ ump can react to negative press cuts , especially those with damaged Lec@@ ks , and that it comes out to find out how they come from .
this happened at the end of February when som@@ eb@@ ody gave a printed copy of an article of Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet Pro@@ v@@ ok@@ at@@ eur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the Deputy Chief of Staff of K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a cluster of his &quot; Lec@@ ks &quot; at the White House .
although Johnson has been banned from Twitter permanent evidence that he had no specific evidence or that he had sold false alleg@@ ations in the past , and has contra@@ dic@@ ated them .
Tr@@ ump read the article and began to inqu@@ ire at Wal@@ sh . &quot;
Gold@@ macher added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did it work ?
Kelly tries to do three months later , the same .
perhaps he will prove more effective as Pri@@ eb@@ us as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ er are still under influence .
this un@@ altered factors make cell@@ ys mission very difficult .

since 2016 , the website has been viewed at www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ ire , which has been viewed 2,5 million times .
36 of the online providers could have been arrested , at least eleven of them according to the publication on the website .
passengers negoti@@ ate over a tr@@ ench and return to the &apos; billi@@ on@@ ary series &apos;
some of the we@@ al@@ thi@@ est house @-@ owner of West Mid@@ lands have gone back with some escaped travelers on the base , who have tra@@ ded one of the municipality drawn from the community to re@@ claim a field before their man@@ sions in the village .
the passengers have their 20 caravans on a field outside a we@@ al@@ thy street of Soli@@ ks which is called &quot; billi@@ on@@ ary row . &quot;
they had horses , babies and an army of transport carried out , after they were exp@@ elled until May , without being shot down by a council excav@@ ated from the council , to prevent their in@@ mates .
the tak@@ eover group found a gap in the defense systems and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ disabled to find a path .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Council of Soli@@ d@@ be@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said that it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; us@@ eless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said : &quot; they were moved there on Monday evening after they were sent to Bentley He@@ ath , where they were thrown onto the pass@@ ers .
the Council must be obliged by failure to implement in fact , since he was us@@ eless in dealing with the problem .
the traveler were in May there , were moved forward and are now back .
more came last night , probably today more . &quot;
she added : &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to move to protect long transfers to protect their parks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not happy at the Stre@@ am@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to pay my law@@ fully if the Council can stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a resident who wanted not to be called , said : &quot; it is ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , we just have seen the last round of this tour , only to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round .
the numbers have increased this time and you can even see a horse in the parking area . &quot;
an spokes@@ woman of the Council of Soli@@ ks said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the land beyond the Stre@@ am@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we sei@@ ze the necessary legal steps to move it as quickly as possible .
to support our satisfaction collection , it is very important that as many people as many residents are to report an anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling 101 .
this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the Court must check when we present our case . &quot;
from Birken@@ hof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Birken@@ hof , the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is located .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts is currently being renovated and will be reopened on the 1st of March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the Birken@@ hof at the then Ambiente Company mbH about 30 000 overnight stays per year were lost and income by the local tax .
in autumn 2014 , in the fall of 2014 , in view of the figures of refugees that were offered in the County , the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation , which was responsible for controversi@@ al discussions .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers by the establishment of a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not disp@@ uted at that time at that time .
but above all the Freu@@ den@@ stadt Supreme Court of Julian Oss@@ wald defended the hotel location and spoke at the time of serious interested persons in the house .
he should keep right .
the group Lu@@ isen@@ ard with Managing Director Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it to a house of the three @-@ star plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ians and one in Bad Men &apos;s Man@@ al@@ b .
you are called Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the previous Hotel Birken@@ hof , there are already a long time constru@@ ctional container in front of the entrance , and when you enter the house , it is clear that extensive renov@@ ations will be performed .
the floors were pulled out , ceilings to part dismant@@ led , antique tu@@ bs from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there is still much to do until March .
&quot; it is actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything is to be renewed in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald style .
the rooms are equipped with spacious showers , the input range is converted , new window will be installed .
everything should be so close as &quot; beauty , &quot; how Thomas Sch@@ erer becomes ex@@ presses .
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewelry . &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and meeting room belong to the equipment .
if you are not positioned at the high level of the hotel in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but it &apos;s already under@@ stand@@ ings at a higher level of the city .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms will be set to a wide range of places .
both individual tourists , groups or business@@ men are to feel good in the hotel .
talks with O@@ B Julian Oss@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael K@@ rau@@ se he already led , so Sch@@ erer .
the performances of the city are equal with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
after the amount of investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to fix .
less than one million euros , he calcul@@ ates .
external systems are also brought to front man , this is clearly visible .
there is a large terrace that will be accessible to the public in a courtyard , which is publicly accessible .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia Aff@@ air : U.S. Special Jury impl@@ ements the Grand Jury
in Russia &apos;s aff@@ air to US President Donald Tr@@ ump is said to have appointed Special Jury Robert Mu@@ eller after a report called Grand Jury .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the panel recorded work in recent weeks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote on appeal with the cause trusted in the past few weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the newspaper evalu@@ ates the step as signs that Mu@@ eller have expanded its investigations and intensi@@ fied .
the CN@@ N transmitter reported that the bodies of the committee had already been associated with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps el@@ dest son and a Russian lawyer .
us secret services acc@@ use the Kre@@ m@@ lin for prolonged , targeted in the presidential campaign in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller examined whether there were refer@@ enced between Tr@@ um@@ ps Cont@@ rolling team and Moscow .
in the focus of investigations , several men are to be involved in the campaign as an advisor to the rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
according to reports , Mu@@ eller also took more and more tr@@ um@@ ps private and business environment under the micro@@ scope .
the Washington Post , wrote some weeks ago that the special investig@@ ator Tr@@ ump personally spent personally in the center and supp@@ lic@@ t the alleg@@ ations whether the President was disabled by justice in the course of the aff@@ air .
the main task of Grand Law@@ ys is to test this evidence in possible frag@@ ile accidents and to decide whether Indi@@ ct@@ ment shall be charged .
therefore Grand Jur@@ ys are called also count @-@ chambers .
mostly they are turned on when it is about larger and controversi@@ al cases .
the procedure is always closed behind the closed doors .
the panel can also be turned on by the Public Prosecutor to address persons under the oath of E@@ id .
according to the CN@@ N , pre @-@ inv@@ itations were issued to turn around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
persons who participated in the meeting were asked to a statement to be called in the report .
in addition , they should provide documents .
apart from Tr@@ ump J@@ r. there were also Tr@@ um@@ ps consultants and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner as well as his team leader Paul Man@@ a@@ fort with the conversation .
right @-@ wing per@@ formers said on Thursday night in the US television that the suspension show that Mu@@ eller should not be so@@ ber in his work , and that it should be necessary to act quickly .
but it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be on the end to decide on the survey of an indictment .
nevertheless , the incorpor@@ ation of the bodies of the beginning of a new phase in investigations and a new reason to concern the concern for President Tr@@ ump .
in the middle of the new unveil@@ ing , the President on Thursday evening was given a speech in West Virginia to present the Russia aff@@ air as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia history is a complete invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the theme give the Democrats a way to feel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well to feel good because they can &apos;t talk about that they speak . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advisor T@@ y Cob@@ b declared in a comment , he knows nothing of the creation of a Grand Jury .
but they are usually working in the enclosure , he emphas@@ ized .
the White House advoc@@ ates all measures that accelerated the work of the special tool on a fair in &quot; fair . &quot;
the former FB@@ I boss James Com@@ ey has said three times that it would not be determined against the president .
you have no reason to accept that something has changed , it was in the explanation about it .
but Mu@@ eller had been used only after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
because of this r@@ asp@@ ir@@ ation , alleg@@ ations against dr@@ ump was made according to Tr@@ ump , he wants to im@@ pe@@ dient to justice .
Com@@ ey said in June of a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump asked him to set a setting of the investigations against the national security consultant Michael Fl@@ ynn .
the president stands under great pressure because of the investigation .
after the US media display , the White House collected material against the special workers and its staff .
this solved spec@@ ulations by whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller is released .
unlike an independent special request of Congress , as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate @-@ Aff@@ aires , led by Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has fired a position in which he could be fired at the fac@@ ulty of the President of the Ministry of Justice .
several trans@@ formers of both parties want to vote in such a step but prevention .
two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic transmitters met on Thursday the legisl@@ ature , after which the special dispens@@ er could no longer be dismissed as easy .
Antar@@ ctic : gigantic Eis@@ berg drives in Antar@@ c@@ tica
in the West Arctic , a gigantic ice@@ berg has solved by the Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is from the barely 7 @-@ fold size of Berlin .
the Alfred Weg@@ ven@@ er Alfred Weg@@ ener Institute for Polar and Maritime Research took place on Wednesday .
the over a trillion tons heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometers large col@@ oss@@ oms now drove to the north and will probably take two , three years until it is melted .
it is located at 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers one of the largest ice@@ berg who have registered in the past three decades .
a danger for man does not go out of him .
to what extent of climate change played a role in the demol@@ ition of the ice cream , is un@@ clear after research .
in total , however , there have been a series of unusual coll@@ ision in the region for around 30 years , the U.S. Research Center for Snow and ice ( NS@@ IDC ) writes in a fact behind .
according to many researchers , it could be linked to the global warming .
the tur@@ bul@@ ent Kol@@ oss was a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is .
Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is floating on the sea and is fed by big gl@@ ac@@ iers .
it continues to grow into the sea and breaks off regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is located south of South America almost at the top of the ant@@ ar@@ ctic Peninsula .
at the north of this Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ at , the balance of w@@ axes was distur@@ bed and break up some years ago .
a complete Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is was de@@ pressed there , writes A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is in danger , because the front edge has never pulled back as far as at present .
in addition , the ice @-@ top is lower than voltage and could be broken down , if a piece of keys are broken .
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is and Eis@@ berg rises not sea level as they swim in water and ice cream as much water , as it happens after the melting itself .
however , the loss of the ham lead the gl@@ ac@@ iers directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase the sea level , but only in a low degree , the British research project writes about Antar@@ c@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is , with nearly 50 000 square kilometers , is the fourth largest lake of Antar@@ c@@ tica .
on the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , on the front edge to the free ocean approx . 200 meters .
there it breaks off regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is a natural event and does not require direct connection to climate change , the ice sign is now in a end@@ anger@@ ed position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the most far retreat since the beginning of records &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
under scientists may be controversi@@ al whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is returned , and possibly merge together , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this trend will last decades .
even if these researchers have not lead the breakdown of this gigantic ice r@@ ash to climate change , however , many ice caves of Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have fallen into the past decades .
this long watch of Antar@@ c@@ tica extends towards South America .
according to data from the British Antar@@ ctic Peninsula , the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have dropped by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the temperature increase was contributed to decline .
Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have been war@@ med by around three degrees about three degrees in the past 50 years , putting it in the areas where the temperature at the fastest desc@@ ends .
CDU wants the house rate to the staff
because it is increasingly difficult to occupy any more difficult places , the CDU , from the employer , to become more attractive .
shortly before the summer break , Kre@@ ist@@ ag has 41 new jobs in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and officials are working for the county office in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now there were 17 trainees their first working day .
the courses are evi@@ d@@ ently very sought .
there were about 620 applications to be recorded in this year .
nevertheless , the circuit still lack of staff to cope with the increased requirements and tasks .
at present there are no vac@@ ant positions at the M@@ ett@@ mann district .
searched among other doctors , engineers and forces as well as forces of general management .
the CDU in the Kre@@ ist@@ ag is to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG members of the initiative and of the professionals to manage professionals .
according to the desire of the parties , the administration is expected to work on a concept for personnel and personal development . &quot;
the goal is to cover not only short @-@ term substr@@ ates to professionals , but future @-@ oriented approach to the candidate .
the overall concept should be oriented toward the inside and outside , concrete measures for trans@@ verse trips and require a ure@@ education offensive to require CDU , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
this doesn &apos;t listen to a good approach .
because the circle does not do with personal problems we knew before so .
other cities advertise good civil servants and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is from a real &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of public employ@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this purpose , there is a high number of employees , the disease or age @-@ conditi@@ onally from the service .
so the highest time for action , so that no more places remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Pe@@ oples , Group president of the CDU , continues to go beyond the joint request by his party .
he was long ago in the Kre@@ ist@@ ag for a f@@ aust@@ o of surprise , when he asked the staff covering publicly in question , and the remaining parties were bl@@ oss@@ oms .
peoples want all the possibilities to be checked , which allow a withdrawal from the municipal employer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we no longer come to a satisfactory solution , the county administration should also be able to rise with the unions - a pet rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; peoples &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , the CDU , employees and officials are trying to pay better than the tariff of public service is actually planned .
the sal@@ aries are currently oblig@@ atory , increases or more money only if one changes to a higher level , which is oriented to professional years .
but the tasks of the circle are more than ever grown in the past few years .
only a few weeks ago new rooms had to be arranged in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stit@@ utes protection law .
not least by the rising number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy tigh@@ tened the tone of NGO @-@ Mig@@ rants @-@ rescue boats
Italy has NGOs , who use the power boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they are not able to continue this , if they do not keep new rules for their operations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs speak no new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can re@@ work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Marco Min@@ n@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ nit@@ is warning was a day after the Italian authorities had conf@@ is@@ cated a boat to the German aid organization &quot; Youth R@@ ettet &quot; because their team had been working effectively with human tra@@ ff@@ lers in a way which facilit@@ ated the illegal immig@@ ration .
the aid organization that has only been in operation since one year , refused to express themselves from the Italian state Amb@@ ro@@ gio Cart@@ osi@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , the salvation of human life remains our top priority . so we are very sorry that we are unable to operate in the search and rescue zone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in a comment on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can do all the alleg@@ ations that are currently lifted up , after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had monitored the boat from &apos; Youth R@@ ettet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October .
it is thought that his crew aboard infl@@ atable migrants are delivered to them directly from tra@@ ff@@ lers , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can travel , so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting was report@@ edly held only 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast , according to the accused of the prosecutor , whose content was published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected of deliber@@ ate over the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue operations in zone of humanitarian reasons and not from any other mot@@ ives .
in terms of the Code of Con@@ duct , boats like the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must have an Italian police officers to board their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far been declared to hold on the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be regarded as unnecessary , but acceptable , since they would not bring any &quot; fundamental changes or disability &quot; of their rescue actions .
among those who refused to sign , the Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ate Organisation for Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
Min@@ n@@ iti said , meanwhile , the number of migrants who came to Italy in the last weeks have dropped strongly in the last weeks that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast @-@ Guard and the cooperation with local citizens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he gave plans for more discussions with Libya &apos;s citizens over economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave those countries in hope to reach Europe .
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
nine honey@@ s bi@@ kers , the &quot; Berlin out@@ posts &quot; and two guest drivers met in the North Palat@@ inate region to enjoy four days of tri@@ als and sights .
there were three be@@ amed guides available .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved itself as a good starting point for touring .

console instead of lawn - Bundesliga upgrade for E @-@ Sport
sit the sport stars in the future before computer consoles , instead of swe@@ ating with wind and weather on the stadium race ?
fact : E @-@ Sport has long since become a serious business to become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - great stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high speeds .
this also has recognized the first Bundes@@ lig@@ aver@@ n that are increasingly committed in this field .
the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later followed by the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , which founded a E @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and two professionals took under contract for the computer game FIFA 17 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspir@@ ing all new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jochen R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is another one to asc@@ end on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next weekend , FIFA World Cup FIFA takes place in London the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where the Gam@@ ers of various clubs joined each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eindhoven have qualified .
Robin D@@ utt provides great potential in e @-@ sport .
the Ex @-@ Trainer by Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen has meanwhile been a agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real football must lie in particular with the 14 to 30 years old that the young people still go into the stadium , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 year old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : trying to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian , to conquer .
with prominent E @-@ sport@@ s@@ men under contract one could be present far more often in these markets , than once a year , to send the Federal lig@@ atory zone to Asia once a year .
what &apos;s it exactly ?
while e @-@ sport will computer games like &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; or the soccer simulation of FIFA at competitive level .
as in normal sport , as in normal sport , Li@@ gen has established itself , in which the professionals can compete each other .
and for the Asia 2006 , E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program .
but is it all about a real sport ?
for many , the presentation is safely normal .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ese has dealt several long with the question .
for the professor at the German Sport@@ s- University in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport , because he is competent and many biological and physical reactions , which one can also find in classic sports , for example , elevated cardi@@ ac frequencies , hor@@ m@@ onal changes .
besides , it need cogn@@ itive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast reaction ability .
professional gam@@ ers should not only exercise at the console but also exercise its body and the diet .
&quot; the f@@ itte Player is a good player . &quot;
F@@ rob@@ ese sees problems : &quot; d@@ oping is always more a theme . &quot;
controls are seriously fe@@ as@@ ible in online games , and in the scene failed the structures of classical Sports .
positive results from the scientist the high integ@@ rative effect of E @-@ Sports .
players are internationally travelling , this is like a large global family , there is no inter@@ cultural shirts .
a study by the Del@@ o@@ itte and the German Association Inter@@ active Entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) says to the E @-@ Sport a rapid growth in advance .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments .
sales in three years is expected to be 130 million .
against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the soccer Bundesliga , this is little bit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the E @-@ sport &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; isn &apos;t far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice @-@ hockey , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte Consult@@ ant &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
International are many countries ahead .
great markets are Asia and the United States where ex @-@ basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez is participating in the US Team N@@ RG e@@ Sports .

Michelle Carter because of the texts who was sentenced to suicide in Conrad Roy
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years , because she encour@@ ages her boy@@ friend by texts and calls to suicide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 months ago , will spend 15 months of her condem@@ nation behind gam@@ ers and five years were exposed to par@@ ole .
Carter was sentenced to death in June for the cas@@ ual killing of Conrad Roy who committed suicide on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing of : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is un@@ search@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter allowed to stay free until the vocation .
she was con@@ fron@@ ted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but their legal representatives argu@@ ed that both her and Mr Roy had suffered from a mental illness .
in red p@@ ants and a cream coloured bl@@ ouse , Carter defended with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and down@@ wards eyes when they were condemned .
&quot; their actions have killed Conrad Roy , &quot; said the State attor@@ ney in court .
&quot; she finished his life to make their own better .
she has no responsibility &quot; , &quot; she said .
&quot; she does not have a Reu@@ ver . &quot;
but Car@@ ters attor@@ ney it was a &quot; awesome surrounding which she was completely sorry . &quot;
judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz , however , did not find out that her &quot; age or maturity , or even her spiritual disease did a significant influence on their actions . &quot;
a prosecutor read about Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy where he promised that &quot; no day &quot; in whom I don &apos;t smoke the loss of my beloved son .
I would like to be proud of me and how I am proud of all . I try , despite all my pain , which we shall bear for eternity with us , is called it in it .
Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she would never be persecuted by the knowledge . &quot; I will never be able to participate in the wedding of her brother or would be a a@@ unt for his children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not to have this only person , with whom I was together with my birth every day , is a pain , whom I will keep for the rest of my life forever , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to set a legal preced@@ ent since there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to request a violation of suicide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in 2014 by a carbon mon@@ oxide po@@ is@@ oning in a vehicle .
the case drew national attention to after coming Car@@ ters text messages revealed that she encour@@ ages him to quit his life .
&quot; hanging yourself , spring from a building , first cut yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; she said in several messages which she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was with his family vacation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the sight of his suicide , she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must do it , Conrad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything you must do is to put to the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter searched attention through the death of Roy and ordered that they should benefit from any press that could benefit from the case .
the case is divided by the legal opinion .
to the few that Carter defended , Am@@ anda Knox , who was sentenced to Italy in 2007 due to murder of her British co @-@ inhabitants before being acquitted of two years ago .
Mrs. Knox , 30 years old , released a comment : &quot; Michelle Carter earned compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich : learning from the new mini @-@ Lah@@ m of the FC Bayern
that Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich was running at the Audi Cup as an Captain , is no co@@ incidence .
the FC Bayern dominated the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner for a great season - with extra motivation .
something was otherwise on his place in the cabin , that looked Joshua K@@ imm@@ i immediately , even if the additional clothes piece was very small , very small .
but since far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course there was not a Philipp Lah@@ m and also not a Manuel New to see , he made the opposition to the arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trainer has not announced it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner , after his first use as Bavaria @-@ Kapitän . &quot; &quot; &quot;
good , the one would have better run than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the character from the coach could also suggest that .
not the eight year old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al was chosen by youth players , de@@ but@@ ant , and just chosen from the holiday of professionals existing C @-@ El@@ f as a game leader , but he has chosen .
sug@@ ars are distributed to those who want to have a lot to hold a lot when you want to hold on the mood .
for those who have chosen the inheritance of the lame , a small extra motivation can only be used well .
K@@ imm@@ ich confirmed : &quot; this is what you want to do as a player : responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old was a mini @-@ Lah@@ m over the field .
at the right side , this is now its position , the white binder on the arm opened her rest .
and at all , K@@ imm@@ ich worked in this approach as the one who can also take the ru@@ dder at the best in the hand .
he gave instructions who tried to direct the un@@ installed tro@@ upe .
he had a look for all , while many others work with themselves .
Vid@@ al therefore , his missing fitness play ( folds ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches could see that the Devil come out to the achievements of Asia @-@ voyage ( also only conditi@@ onally ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le makes it not negative in their first appearance at the Bayern Tri@@ ang .
this is quite good .
Sü@@ le ran next to K@@ imm@@ i , Rud@@ y before the defense , both ag@@ ated so@@ vereign .
the famous Nap@@ oli storm occupied himself often , in addition , Sü@@ le tried to successfully build a few times in the game construction .
his colleague Rud@@ y gave us that the result was &quot; not so , as we were hop@@ ing for us . &quot;
but he showed an ordinary performance at their debut .
game re@@ discovery , speed : &quot; for this style , I was picked up . &quot;
as usual , the Bavaria @-@ world is still standing for the New Releases section , the game was seen in the connection to the game .
Rud@@ y for example gave not one or two , but determines six or seven interviews .
K@@ imm@@ i passed on after a few cris@@ p statements in the back of his new players .
there he heard of Sü@@ le an interesting sentence : &quot; what is going on , I noticed now .
at Bayern you just need to win any game . &quot;
nevertheless , he doesn &apos;t need to teach the new anymore .

company satisfied with Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate Minister : economy lo@@ dges W@@ iss@@ ing pace
it was often im@@ planted , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke ( Grün@@ e ) still was Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
this is reflected after more than one year , in which the new Minister of Commerce Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak to T V demand of a change in economic policy - and t@@ m@@ ates at the same time the old Minister .
Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ une Companies ( V@@ TU ) says : &quot; Wis@@ sing increases the wishes of the business , the Lem@@ ke has been blocked . &quot;
the biggest ger@@ turn@@ around can see Nat@@ us in the infrastructure policy : the bridge of the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au stands in the priority list of the country .
this year the ministry is hop@@ ing for a planning procedure until 2021 is scheduled to stand .
a role in the plans of the country is also playing the West@@ um@@ er@@ ung Trier , which is in the pre@@ ur@@ gent need of the German traffic plan .
the aim is to take the route in December 2020 in operation , says Minister @-@ speaking , Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us sees a sign to support regional , but international competing companies .
the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) Trier is stim@@ ulated by Wis@@ sing , in order to increase the Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate label to increase the sales of supermarkets in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German Wine exports for ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to establish a dedicated company , pra@@ ises the Chamber of Commerce .
in the new Master bonus , the Handwerk@@ skammer Trier sees an additional inc@@ en@@ tive for young apprentices , says Managing Director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
it is fore@@ seen a reward of 1000 Euro for the next master examination and 2500 euros when graduates are self @-@ employed within ten years after the championship .
the hom@@ e@@ work list for the country remains long .
in the planned road construction , we can quickly create facts , at the same time , Jan Glock@@ auer , the managing director of the Chamber of Commerce Trier .
with a total of 56 new engineers , the Wis@@ sing wants to be able to set mobility so far only 29 places are occupied .
the I@@ HK calls for more jobs to be awarded to external offices .
CDU @-@ Fra@@ ct@@ vi@@ ze Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf refers to calculations of the host , the country invested more than 20 million euros less in the receipt of state roads in 2017 and 2018 .
Frank Nat@@ us also expects the country to resol@@ ve how it wants to solve the country of crafts@@ man in the region .
in addition , the old broad@@ band extension in the country is further .
in 2016 , regional companies had only rated power supply in an I@@ HK survey only with Note 3.4 .
they compl@@ ained about mol@@ dy Internet connections and di@@ ps .
the ex @-@ economic Minister Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke is currently out of the policy and is still seated at the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind .
the Green Group left Lem@@ ke on April to become the president of a private university in Karlsruhe , where they had already reached the field after four months .
Audi should change 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers are faced with a counter reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi said BMW said that it would be able to upgrade the software in more than 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
the BMW chair said that &quot; it is the opinion that &quot; it is intelligent options as a road@@ limitations , &quot; and therefore went to European cities - including Munich where BMW is based on diesel vehicles or restri@@ ct diesel vehicles .
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described companies as recall .
European car manufacturers have strongly sponsored the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
but nitrogen oxi@@ des that em@@ it diesel engines are considered to be car@@ cin@@ ogenic and may cause as@@ thma .
the cost of autom@@ akers , systems for neutr@@ alisation of diesel vehicles to be installed , also assume what it makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
the German ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or Angela Merkel is also accused of ignor@@ ing the powerful auto@@ act and trade marks of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the mist@@ akes of Volkswagen , which could regul@@ ate emissions from so @-@ called de@@ position tools that could regul@@ ate the regulations when a car was tested but under normal conditions .
several employees of Volkswagen were indicted in the United States , others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
in the past month , the former head of the Ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics was arrested in Germany in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni Pam@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be tried in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi acc@@ eded into German criminal investig@@ ations@@ in Volkswagen after the authorities of acc@@ using existing system to circum@@ vent the emission regulations in Europe , and an inquiry that focused on the United States , was expanded .
the inclusion of Audi into the investigation could load Volkswagen heavily : the luxury car manufacturer is disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ately proportional to winning Volkswagen .

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ es and laugh@@ ter against the afflicted
Mor@@ dil@@ lo was one of the most published cartoon character set , the Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ es of his figures are the trademark .
even with 85 the Argentin@@ ian is still working and works in a film .
his message : laugh@@ ter , &quot; For there is too much sorrow in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ dil@@ lo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immig@@ rants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he smote himself as a dra@@ fts@@ man for happiness cards - what is fru@@ str@@ ated .
&quot; the most happy day in my professional life was the day when in my job , &quot; he said once .
after stations in Lima , New York and Paris succeeded in the end of the 60s , with the publication of its carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then also in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China Mor@@ dil@@ lo took many fans .
and again the artist moved to cities again .
large , all @-@ round Mor@@ dil@@ lo figures tum@@ ble in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
on the early morning he s@@ itt@@ eth his own details today also at the Dra@@ wing , working daily for almost ten hours .
about calendar , puzzles , books for large and small , T @-@ Shirts , Pl@@ ush favorites and watches , find out many spread across the world .
he has also been working in a drawing film and a TV series with its figures for six years .
the main person in the movie &quot; Crazy Island &quot; is a gi@@ raffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los all popular animal in his drawings - that has an exchange @-@ feet as counter@@ part .
for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie , which is to come to the chin @-@ up wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what they will say , it is strange to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ dil@@ lo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
for this reason , he puts more on the TV series , which , like its original drawings , wor@@ t@@ less .
lav@@ ender threatened from Provence climate change
he has become a symbol of the Provence in Southern France but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .
the lav@@ ender is remin@@ ded of the rec@@ ess of d@@ rought , and because of the diseases of the insec@@ ts , scientists and farmers , trying to find solutions , are prepared to find solutions , large head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert in the agricultural research institute CR@@ I@@ EP@@ P@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; the Lav@@ ender in Provence is effectively end@@ anger@@ ed because the plant was exposed to the effects of climate change , which brought much less rain in the spring and much more .
this has impact on the lif@@ esp@@ an of lav@@ ender .
there is also a small c@@ ic@@ ade , a micro bacter@@ ium , transfers the d@@ warf , and with very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and it is much on the game .
lav@@ ender oil attracts not only for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also very popular for perf@@ umes and cosmetics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of very long plant pipes with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , UN@@ TER@@ EN@@ TW@@ IC@@ K@@ EL@@ TE and either missing or weak@@ ened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we have less parts with essential oil . &quot;
the solutions that are considered to be considered , belong to a better water distribution and the slow@@ down of evap@@ oration from the ground , but also the removal of plants with a protective mixture of sound and water and the development of varieties that are resistant to dry resistance .

the assassination of a journalist emphas@@ ises the growing threat in Mexico
the employees of weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ce meet usually on Wedn@@ esdays to check their plans for reporting the most recent chaos within the State of Sin@@ al@@ oa with the organized crime , cor@@ ted civil servants and in@@ cess@@ ory drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of her own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
it was told them that it is important to change their rout@@ ines .
two high @-@ level journalists will discuss the saf@@ er : they are supposed to take their children with the office , which were the aim of an attack with gren@@ ades , or to leave her home in 2009 .
security experts have written three words to a table on the front of the room : opponent , neutral , ally .
they ask the re@@ por@@ ters to propose names for every column - no evidence is necessary , perc@@ eptions and abdom@@ inal sensation .
there are drug ad@@ versaries , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected to stand on the sal@@ aries of the government or the cart@@ els , a catalog of crimin@@ als which make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there are no rest of violence , and during the whole country the cor@@ p@@ ses are frequent , there are more journalists : at least 25 , since president En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto has stepped up in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are having regard to attacks and thre@@ ats in the federal government and until now there were at least seven dead in seven countries .
the latter is editor and their inspiration of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , the co @-@ founder of Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his many books on violence in connection with drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s lack of absence , although its presence is present - a big photo by Val@@ dez , showing his mid @-@ finger with the word &quot; Justice &quot; . two re@@ por@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , carry T @-@ shirts that show his sm@@ iling face with glasses or typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop will take place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porter discuss their shared topics , the trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , ins@@ om@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a special edition of the Federal Ministry of Public Affairs was established in 2010 to work the cases of journalists , according to the Committee for the protection of journalists only two pen@@ alties .
as with the most thousands of Mor@@ ning who are associated with drug tra@@ ff@@ icking and organis@@ ational crimes , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists will only rarely be tried in court .
in Ri@@ odo@@ ce , they still exist to treat power from sin@@ al@@ oa , although they are in@@ tox@@ ic@@ uous , although the terrain is even more av@@ enge now .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meetings on safety has little benefits , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it is very stup@@ id to turn my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; as long as we know why we know all . &quot;
on the morning of May 15 Val@@ dez left the Office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the state capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was forced by two men . he was forced to move on him for 12 times , probably because of the name of the newspaper - who is translated into a twel@@ fth river .
the rest drove off in his car and damaged it in the vicinity .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but the topic Val@@ dez there is practically nothing in silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest in January and the extra@@ dition of the United States in January , Sin@@ al@@ oa became one of the most bloody batt@@ lements of the country , since rival fac@@ tions have been fighting here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ al@@ oa every day or several people on the streets are shot or that the gra@@ vey@@ ard is full of ench@@ ants , two @-@ story m@@ ol@@ een for drug users who are larger than many houses for the living .
remember for a minute that there is a state of peace &quot; there , if only a Kart@@ ell has control over the coastal state with its valuable har@@ bors and drugs trade routes in the United States .
nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the haz@@ ards of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , is destroyed by the fault that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understanding have contributed to the murder .
first , in February , the publication of a interviews with Dam@@ o L@@ op@@ ez , a leader of the riv@@ alled cart@@ el fra@@ ctions in war with Gu@@ z@@ mans &apos;s sons .
this release may be anno@@ ying the sons , suspected of each copy of the issue , as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ke .
the second fault was to force Val@@ dez for this purpose , according to the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper that had published the same story to leave the country at its own security .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists .
he had so long survived that his friends and colleagues ann@@ im@@ itate that he would be always there .
he was active in 2003 as an experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este , when he joined Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars in hol@@ dings .
in Sin@@ al@@ oa , &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without any problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
the newspaper underwent a call for the cour@@ age@@ ous and hon@@ our@@ able coverage , and the sales and advertis@@ ements received .
re@@ por@@ ters loved it to publish hard tre@@ ats without fear of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , and the readers were fascin@@ ated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody would be dar@@ ed to treat .
eight years after the foundation of Ri@@ odo@@ ce she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for their coverage in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of journalists in the persecution of Mexican Dru@@ gs history , where he also led them .
he gave himself up that he had fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to continue to live , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J . &quot; &quot; &quot;
drug trade in Sin@@ al@@ oa , &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said in October , in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV .
&quot; you need to take the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you are playing the dum@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what have you done ? why did you not say what was going before ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team mis@@ ses Val@@ dez , the fun bird , who was able to curse the friend who was gener@@ ously with h@@ ugs and coun@@ ties , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted at his routine .
he would always bear his hat .
he would always be to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , go there on the same table there .
now they ask : was his love for routine in destruction ?
his death has also been forced to ask her own interests in question how they can do their work on the best thing and to stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like to move with their wives , their children , their clean shops , home and run@@ ways &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ self @-@ self @-@ self @-@ maintenance .
trust his own installer .
if it sm@@ ells wrong , stay away from it .
the trouble is , said the editor of Ri@@ odo@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real that , &quot; smell a sense that can be mo@@ cked ... and then the thing with Javier happens . &quot;
the old rules , such as he and others say , apply in Sin@@ al@@ oa , just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a toxic mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative sm@@ ug@@ es , weak institutions and corrupt government officials .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in the room where the employees met by Ri@@ odo@@ ce for security training , suddenly there were no mobile phones . days earlier , Spyware , who sells exclusively to governments to monitor the surveillance of journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen sought refuge in front of the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of an tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a middle @-@ class quarter of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in Pur@@ g@@ ites , some of the re@@ por@@ ters asked whether they belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who own Govern@@ or himself as not tru@@ st@@ worthy .
it is months ago , since the re@@ porter have gone into the mountain landscape where the drug lists de fac@@ to under control .
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has shot on three main stories .
it was the assassination of the brother &apos;s brother Juli@@ o Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ al@@ oa .
they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é to the state spending that focused on the hom@@ etown of the governor .
and there was a group that in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the prosecutor , led a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about it , who was ab@@ duc@@ ted or as it was , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite local drug ad@@ diction and authorities .
a re@@ porter learned from public notes that the restaurant was registered under the name of a policy which ruled the reg@@ ent Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( pr@@ i ) which ruled nearly the whole century all political levels .
recently , several pr@@ i govern@@ ors were accused of corruption of high @-@ cali@@ bre corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write over previous inci@@ dents in this loc@@ al , including one in which a son of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was de@@ ferred by a military attack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a few months ago the readers of Val@@ dez had informed the column of Val@@ dez as the best informed source of ab@@ duction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier we had known what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El FLACO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of its slim body composition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
the Val@@ dez office was dedicated to the storage room for signs and st@@ ic@@ kers , dedicated to the Mor@@ de of journalists , because the employees have become something that they never expected it : activ@@ ist in the name of the press .
re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez @-@ sn@@ apped a few signs and passed the next morning to a demonstration for another journalist for the Office of the Prosecutor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed , in the western federal state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an .
a burned body has been discovered and civil servants have been discovered , based on DNA testing that it is his .
in the whole country , journalists became stronger , having written in organized protests , &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on obe@@ dience and buildings .
on that day , director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is gone in Washington and tries to gather international support for justice in the case of Val@@ dez .
during a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ al@@ oa on the day after the assassination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities to ex@@ pressing journalists and to kill them because they said the truth .
she has been asked since then to be divided by the government , because it is concerned that her rage has viol@@ ated their obj@@ ec@@ tivity .
Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico of organiz@@ ational crimes committed by government officials and a valid society . &quot;
in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that re@@ porter cannot only be killed by drug , but also at the command of politics and security forces that put a organized crime under a ceiling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ulo 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ulo 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico do you die , because you want to keep the mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously the mur@@ ders have a terrible effect .
no one will forget the death of the blo@@ g@@ rief Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as at six years ago .
her body was found along with a note that was allegedly signed by the Z@@ etas de Kart@@ ell : &quot; here I am for my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and ear@@ phones in addition to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Ch@@ ihu@@ ah@@ ua after the assassination of the Mi@@ ros@@ ih@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to do like El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the assassination of its Director in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed to the drug cart@@ els with a gui@@ ding article on the front page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists went out of their home country or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it &apos;s hard to find work in exile , and still watch the streets and seek for d@@ angers .
and sometimes they are ch@@ ased , as evi@@ d@@ ently the photographer Ruben Esp@@ in@@ osa who , in 2015 , together with four women in a dwelling in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who continue to stay and continue working , it is a daily dance with risk @-@ rich decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , gives him that the drug tra@@ des him .
&quot; Mexico is going to hell , and therefore I became a re@@ porter , &quot; he said .
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last edition had already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce were sitting on the brush before the office and drank beer , than once all of their teleph@@ ones began to sum@@ s .
a number of shooting @-@ paintings with band@@ en@@ ri@@ vals and security forces near the Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war es@@ cal@@ ated further , as promised by a series of cart@@ el em@@ bas@@ sies in the region .
from on @-@ board edge , they published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce about mobile .
the front page was to be changed on the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens , close to - a further shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the polic@@ emen who held watch to see if they were in read@@ iness .
if they were afraid , they did not show them .
under the enormous portrait of the fallen Grün@@ ders of the newspaper , whose middle @-@ finger was visible for the whole Sin@@ al@@ oa , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed its traces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you keep only thinking about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Javier was murdered on the same day that Javier was murdered , she asked me to send them to the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ouflage to depart his enemies
at first glance it looks like a statue , though a fri@@ gh@@ tening .
now , researchers found that the first findings of the incredible rhin@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian min@@ ers were so well preserved that experts were described as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa the Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so good that they could even determine that his shoe skin was of red@@ dish Braun - and they said that she had something of a &quot; unknown past . &quot;
the report in the journal &quot; Current Biology &quot; called him as &quot; the be@@ aded din@@ osau@@ rs Din@@ osau@@ rs , who was ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs copies of the world . &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered kind of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier who lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his incredibly well preserved condition has researchers that it is considered &quot; really remarkable . &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the mo@@ red plant car@@ ni@@ vo@@ res is the best preserved F@@ ossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he was born on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , dug .
he met somewhat , what seemed to the surrounding rock in the place , and decided to look at a look .
discovered by him F@@ ossil was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to cover the wild beast inside the 2,500 pound ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) .
after all these hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you only blind a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that it hat@@ ched &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the main aut@@ or Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum , where the creature is to be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it will enter the science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs copies - Mon@@ a Lisa the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
researchers found that this plant @-@ car@@ ni@@ vo@@ res , although it is covered with a arm@@ or , and a changing tank , probably from car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the strong din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ouflage to hide themselves in front of prey , and used a par@@ ach@@ ute technology that is known as counter@@ act , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have been allowed to mix well into its surroundings and prevent his enemies , experts predi@@ ct that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creature of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family has made head@@ lines in May and is now at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal , and it is called Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the Muse@@ um@@ st@@ echni@@ ker Mark Mitchell , one of a team that has spent more than 7.000 hours to cover it carefully .
the amazing conservation of specimen enabled the Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the patterns and the form of sheds and arms over his body .
they discovered the conf@@ ession , a widespread defense method in animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was dar@@ ker than their under@@ side .
although it is common , the results are surprising because the size of Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta exceeds that of the living animals today .
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ rs has ch@@ ased sufficient pressure through the car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , making evolution of the con@@ front@@ ation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that use the past@@ ures - think of R@@ ehe , Zeb@@ ras or G@@ ird themselves - are much smaller and viol@@ ently than prey , which was sign@@ alled that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight .
&quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ ory behaviour on a massive , strong white din@@ osau@@ rs show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs pir@@ ates have to have been the cra@@ de@@ cent of the C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous period , &quot; said Brown .
chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ rs was rot@@ ted .
scientists continue to investigate the animal on advis@@ es about his life , including its preserved v@@ int@@ ent to figure out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs , when he died , fell into a river and pushed into the sea , where he sank on the back of the sea .
at that time Alberta were as warm as South @-@ fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much more land@@ ward than they are today .
this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because he is covered fully with cont@@ emp@@ t@@ less skin , but also in three dimensions it remains and the original form of the beast &apos; ret@@ ains , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; the result is that the animal is almost exactly like in the early delivery time .
you don &apos;t need to use fantasy to re@@ constru@@ ct it . if you only have a little with your eyes , you might believe that he is in sleep . &quot;
the C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous was a time when huge ther@@ op@@ oden , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ r , who stood on two legs , crossed the earth .
although the king of them , the ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived millions years after Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the pan@@ eled Din@@ osau@@ rs was ch@@ ased by some of his fur@@ ious ancestors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 11.5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters .
the scientists , their latest findings in the journal Current Biology appear , believe that Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta have been reconc@@ iled after death in the sea and in mud m@@ um@@ ified .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he was born on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , dug .
according to the museum , it is the ham@@ mer@@ ed din@@ osau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle until the hip .
the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1.300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips developed by his shoul@@ ders .
the researchers believe that the pan@@ eled plant car@@ ni@@ vo@@ res was damaged through the western Canada until the floo@@ ded river was floo@@ ded into the open sea .
but the underwater operation of the din@@ osau@@ rs kept his arm@@ our in fine item detail .
the rem@@ n@@ ants of this special specimen are so good that the skin is still going to cover the hol@@ y@@ rings along the din@@ osau@@ ri@@ ers .
like Michael Gre@@ sh@@ ko for National Ge@@ ographic , it is such a level of conservation so &apos; rare like a profit in lotto numbers .
the more I see it , the more conf@@ used it .
cr@@ ush rem@@ n@@ ants of skin still cover the hol@@ mo@@ red plates that bear the skull of the animal .
his right front foot is on its side , its five fingers are donated to the top .
I can count the sheds on his sole &apos; .
in a thunder@@ storm : mass ar@@ rests on the A8 : many injured
more heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : almost 30 cars are involved in a mass position .
there are numerous injured , kil@@ owatt @-@ long punching and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the Autobahn Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) , approximately 20 people were injured during the late Thursday morning .
after the first time the police had been between 17.00 hrs between the connecting stations Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( Landkreis A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a gradient of nearly 30 vehicles , among them probably also trucks .
more information about the exact number of the last layers were not dis@@ closed .
it took action around slight to medium injuries , a police man said .
a big rising to rescue vehicles was at the accident of the accident .
the A8 was completely locked in the direction of Munich .
a approximately ten kilometres long back@@ drop was formed in the direction of Munich .
like a AZ re@@ porter , it came also on the counter @-@ road to massive han@@ di@@ ers - by numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire brig@@ ade records the mark of the vehicle tra@@ ker who now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 then there was another second accident on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
it was a coll@@ ision with a car transporter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the go to the accident .
German train : Group test@@ et &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it &apos;s a moment that almost everyone had ever experienced , nothing was sitting in the train and sleeps .
or it is deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : buff@@ ered .
when Schaff@@ ner came and wo@@ ke up an in@@ ox or stir@@ s the ride in the midst of the workflow .
tickets control .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are over soon .
the Deutsche Bahn currently tests the app @-@ free tickets control .
it is simply confirmed by mobile phone that you should be taken place and evalu@@ ates the ticket .
at present a test mode runs on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes this offer , we expect it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is likely to be available early next year on many further correspondence in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one lane speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; calls the train service evaluation without Schaff@@ ner .
in order to use the benefits , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to have booked an online ticket - what you have to do with most passengers already .
it is also necessary to have purchased the App &apos;s App , DB Navigator , which is the most comfortable way of the ticket book .
and recently you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says : you get to the train , call his ticket under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then a button on the electronic validation will appear then .
the train atten@@ dant for their mobile devices have a message that Fahr@@ g@@ ast X is located in the train and the booked seating area Y .
comes the train atten@@ dant for seat control to place Y knows that there is a passenger with already vali@@ dated online ticket .
so you can further get further , further silent .
the &quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customers , one for the railway - which is to take advantage of the passengers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who relaxed without ticket control would like to travel through our train ticket , check in the DB navig@@ ator just yourself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this allows the passengers to create their travel time in the train personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , marketing management of DB correspondence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our employees have more time than today to enter the individual requirements of the individual requirements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who are often travels , knows that besides del@@ ays and missed trains belong to the greatest doctors .
for often , in any case one of the passengers do not need all documents to use the validation of online tickets .
either lack the credit card or a number of identity card or otherwise a document needed to assign it .
the consequence are endless discussions between train atten@@ dant and suspension , which leads to worse mood in the part or large space and del@@ ays to control of your own tickets and the Schaff@@ ner at the end time , to worry about other calls .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that &apos;s only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further train numbers on the same circuit are not yet available .
how a activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Britt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was sh@@ aken by her core .
just one day after they arrived in New York City , sitting in St. Louis prayers on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b @-@ apartment that they rented and sc@@ roll through Facebook on their phone .
they are proud of a post by someone from the High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have killed an 18 year old child , and there is still on the street , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
conf@@ using , since no one had posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the manual @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah has been constantly prayed to their tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was thereby the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white police in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , Mo . , was killed live .
he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns le@@ bl@@ os@@ em body that was out on the road and would remain there four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was not new for them and their community .
you laid their mobile phone to return later on the evening of Twe@@ ets over people on the Can@@ field @-@ Drive .
there were photos of police band and people , crying , and from a man who claimed to be a sign with the inscription : &quot; Fer@@ g@@ us@@ ons Police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she observed a live feed , which is a polic@@ eman in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a b@@ anning dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assured another polic@@ eman is his defense and cried , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will all kill you ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is not common , &quot; that Fer@@ rel@@ l is remin@@ ded of their statement .
&quot; this is not the kind of murder that we are acc@@ ust@@ omed to us and which we can see . &quot;
at this moment I felt cont@@ em@@ aking .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
you bu@@ ked a return flight and went home next day .
after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she repeated her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two on the next morning would go to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on .
what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary movie , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the cinem@@ as from 11 .
it is a history of survival and Protest@@ ants , love and destruction , strength and resistance , which consists of the sight of people who live in the community and filled the streets to ask answers .
when Fer@@ rel@@ l , with her daughter , wore a flower @-@ dress and a suitable crown , brought the two a conversation , which they had countless times in front of this morning &quot; over the black experience and black condition . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remembered not how I taught you when black people have to fight for those who want to believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now we go to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on because the police killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy , and that was not right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t take it away , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said . &quot;
&quot; what happens today is a high point of what happened in the past .
it has to know , and it must see and be moved in .
it must be well developed , not only acti@@ vis@@ m and organization but also the various layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free to liber@@ ate ourselves .
even though I have lucky enough to give her a experience in which they don &apos;t experience any super@@ natural rac@@ ism , it is no other than the next black women child .
I have the feeling I would give her a bad service to keep it far away . &quot;
the first stop when they arrived in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became a camp site , when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ indictment by Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
in Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter have joined a local company for lunch .
they prepared bags , and hal@@ ve them on demonstr@@ ators .
slowly I began to accept a new type of acti@@ vis@@ m for Fer@@ rel@@ l shape .
&quot; my acti@@ vis@@ m changed after 9 August , &quot; said it and not@@ ices that she was as a student at the University of Missouri @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority student N@@ Course Association and focused on essence of justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities .
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it has come all . &quot;
he later met Fer@@ rel@@ l during an evening demonstration on Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said , she and her cin@@ emat@@ ograph@@ er Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado Far@@ ra@@ r didn &apos;t want to document , &quot; what happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a question was Fer@@ rel@@ l in the sense : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; want to document or attempt to find a story that you can use it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of white , in a community that benef@@ ited from their pain and their resistance to their resistance .
just as Fol@@ ay@@ an declared in an interview : &quot; we had heard that people who were born in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on and grew up and raised their voices , and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area that is known for his acti@@ vis@@ m around death .
his commitment brought the project closer , together with six other nati@@ ves the team followed by &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after brow@@ ns .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or with us . we speak , &quot; said Davis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the main thing for me how these people are represented , for so I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the target was not to focus on Fer@@ rel@@ l &apos;s experience - to show that it is not a Messiah leaders , but for a community that came together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most obvious number of participants in the film .
in fol@@ lic@@ ing , showing documents by &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; sur@@ pris@@ ingly personal aspects of Fer@@ rel@@ ls Life as she loves and mar@@ ries her wife .
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be certain injuries in this work and in the absence of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Fer@@ rel@@ l &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of the black gay women in the wider Black Li@@ ves movement .
two of the three fo@@ unders of the movement that followed the film &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in the social media in 2012 , identify themselves as a gay .
black , pregnant women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; and therefore we are strug@@ gling with different fron@@ ts .
black , schw@@ ule women must bear the main load of everything . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an voted to remember that &quot; the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it insi@@ sted that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a significant type of action , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Fer@@ rel@@ l was chosen as heart of the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of its identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who sh@@ ak@@ ened this energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no co@@ incidence , although she was at the front front , because in a life of these cruci@@ fix@@ ings than a black , weak@@ ens woman as much on the game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
meanwhile , the news conference in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on has recently disappeared , but the ra@@ cial connections between the congregation and the police continue .
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years because of the blocking of a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the social atmosphere of the area that calls her home &quot; : &quot; an chaos . &quot;
nevertheless , she doesn &apos;t wait for a singing and she feels to this memory , since she went on to the road three years ago .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love one another and support .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; size w@@ ahn &quot; : TV readers discuss about Bit gallery
the bit gallery moves the people , although it is not yet built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre on the southern edge of the pedestrian area moved to the people in Be@@ ing wor@@ ries and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
cold lets the topic hardly any one .
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; on our Facebook page .
while recording a bit gallery : &quot; this would be a dream &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; This would be really class &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; needs no man &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ aking ) or completely : &quot; size w@@ ahn ! &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) .
while the advoc@@ ate building plans to attract more customers into the city , the others also benefit from other shops , the ad@@ versary also fear the pedestrian zone .
in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the property , on which the pe@@ asant market hall stands in which 13 directors are mark@@ eted their products .
it will conclu@@ de with the start of the construction work .
the Gallery M@@ acher want to integrate a market hall in the new building - and for Bed@@ a Square with possibility of sitting outside .
Simone Rooms : &quot; we &apos;ve been able to buy almost weekly in the farm hall for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cake of the agriculture always glad@@ ly .
also the but@@ cher we have discovered for us .
we would like to wish that even during and above all , after the building of the gallery , a chance to maintain this promotion .
in other towns , there is too .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; if you are mark@@ eted in a market hall in the gallery , arrives at the height of the rent .
the new project does not have to be too low with the new project . &quot;
Eva Kil@@ ic : &quot; why shopping ar@@ vest in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dro@@ geri@@ es or supermarkets : I find the super@@ flu@@ ous .
there are already enough in our city .
you can see how many stores are empty here - some since months and years .
but since there is not even a regular weekend market , it is more important for us to receive at least the market hall .
because after all , the goods offered there is fresh , mainly the product is offered directly from the product , and is very low priced .
how to see , shop transactions are rented in a shopping center only from larger companies , because the rental rentals are often not portable .
too bad , special business is almost no longer and that which is still left , will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf Tra@@ ff@@ icking : &quot; a shopping center with a Mark@@ thalle is not fit for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the pe@@ asant market hall at building time ?
the old ED@@ EC@@ A would be the solution - even on duration when the bit gallery is really coming .
or does it make the gh@@ ost@@ est bit gallery already before to distribute all shops from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that &apos;s not going to work .
and shopping center , which is empty , does not need any man .
from my view it would have been better to promote a real estate market , instead of this gallery .
but for a pe@@ asant market hall , it is possible thanks to the mad many - how I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg no more .

in the middle of the space of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are visible - white , black and brown that are almost in@@ atten@@ tive to the walls of the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg made of W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ X and Haar@@ mann , which were sent to Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent out the ex@@ cer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former secret service analysis in a 35 @-@ year sentence served as secret diplom@@ acy on the website of Wiki@@ Le@@ aks .
the new exhibition that was opened on August 2 , is A Bec@@ oming Res@@ em@@ bl@@ ance ( A matching simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline was converted to their expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a tran@@ s and pione@@ ering dis@@ sid@@ y whose condem@@ nation was converted by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by the algorithm analysis of DNA , which could be extracted from thirty portraits , such as someone can interpre@@ t with these gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many ways to interpre@@ t it and inher@@ ent the inher@@ ent determin@@ ants of these interpre@@ tations - but also for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born in Brad@@ ley Edward , but already since its pu@@ ber@@ ty on the identification as a woman , was convicted in 2013 because of 20 accus@@ ations , including six violations of the sp@@ ying law , computer , and theft .
the prison was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one single photo - a gra@@ b , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which man@@ ing sits clearly on a driver seat and a plat@@ in@@ bl@@ onde is wearing - she was associated with it .
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came straight from the great success of its 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; .
the artist Por@@ traits have produced from a stranger from for@@ en@@ ic ar@@ te@@ as like cig@@ ar bl@@ unt and chew@@ ing gum by removing the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of it as these people could look like .
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they led an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted to accompany a sort of portrait to this product , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press exhibition .
and she couldn &apos;t be visited at that time and could not be photographed , so that you took contact with Chelsea , and asked them whether they wanted a DNA portrait .
the artist and her in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated M@@ use were bound to un@@ lock Bri@@ eff@@ re@@ ds , who exchanged several letters during the course of two years .
she even called one of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ lied Images &quot; which would be a future predicted in which the President ch@@ orus would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama actually became only a few days after the book was released , Mann@@ ings would ask for seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas , was a welcome sort of happy resources .
there is also now at the opening of the exhibition &quot; Star@@ ke and Star@@ kes , since Donald Tr@@ ump leads an war against in@@ forman@@ t from the government camp and against Trans@@ gender @-@ forces to recover new , twe@@ eter ways , which it should actually resol@@ ve to escape .
as De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg after a strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things were going through a certain reason . &quot;
in one on the wall of the gallery the artistic statement called for Mann@@ ing with their over@@ sized signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in their family name is provided with a heart ) an end of the &quot; automatic cerem@@ onies , whose basis , gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture have been . &quot;
on the opposite wall , its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence is a thous@@ and@@ ler of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hop@@ ed to show how the inclusion of 200 letters ( or nu@@ cle@@ ot@@ ide according to the highly developed scientific Lex@@ icon of the artist ) show how amazing , at least in biological terms , we all are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what people are hop@@ efully to take away , who we are , and how are the genetic data for a interpretation and how sub@@ jective they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video factory of 2007 , are also to be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell as many different stories , therefore the 30 of these stories . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition which is kept in a own room is one page from the mentioned com@@ ic Nov@@ elle mentioned above .
it shows Mann@@ ing , as they appear in the hands of the United States of the United States as King @-@ Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they ch@@ ill your words , then they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so never the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter which she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist who gre@@ et from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m still able to see if I speak about it . &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not been seen before the exhibition - as expected in the com@@ ic book - but when it should do it , then it will be greeted in the middle of the room of the m@@ asks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simulation that is like Hor@@ ses of Protest@@ ants .
that was also targeted , as everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , &quot; Mann@@ ings St@@ ature ) , at which their genetic tro@@ users were written with pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past I had them to the wall , but I wanted to feel like a crowd of men , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I wanted to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that put on behind her liberation . &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and a Fel@@ low of the University of Oxford for murder
a nationwide human hunting is a professor at North@@ western University and an employee at the University of Oxford which became known as a susp@@ ects when a man had been killed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with dead@@ ly injuries .
on Monday the arrest warrant were issued for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham L@@ ath@@ em ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts due to their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the ac@@ claimed Court of the Regional Court of Cook County show .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several sticks .
a certain Community warning system published by the police department of Chicago that the Lei@@ che was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , came to Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries in his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead on the place of events for dead , and det@@ ectives the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police search for the two susp@@ ects said civil servants .
since 2007 L@@ ath@@ em has been Professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at North@@ western University .
Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the vice president for college relations , said in an e @-@ mail address that L@@ ath@@ em was now hidden in be@@ ur@@ k and has been excluded from the University of North@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal matter which is examined by the competent authorities , and the North@@ western University co@@ operates at this examination , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
a spokes@@ person for the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail address that &quot; we with the police in Britain in contact and are ready to help the U.S. investig@@ ative authorities in any way . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens were sho@@ cked and want to sho@@ cked his colleagues .
chief Communications Officer of Chicago , Anthony Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi , said he demanded the susp@@ ects to ask himself to the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police has an introduction of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to loc@@ alize them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities can help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said , the police received a call from the building administrator of the Grand @-@ Plaza building that had just a r@@ ig@@ matic tip that had just happened in apartment 1008 .
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said it was un@@ clear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that L@@ ath@@ em and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi .
the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation about the residents : &quot; the police currently works on the tim@@ eline and the background of the ear and explo@@ it a variety of mot@@ ives , including a possible voice . &quot;
&quot; we will close the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future , &quot; - Russian vice @-@ Vice @-@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko
the Russian @-@ Vice @-@ mi@@ er Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t take long until the remaining criteria of the world @-@ anti @-@ d@@ oping agency ( WA@@ DA ) for restoration of the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) will be implemented .
&quot; in a certain stage of fulfil@@ ment of the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) .
the WA@@ DA chassis has been updated in this regard , &quot; stated Mut@@ ko on Thursday .
the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA road@@ map for compliance with the code which describes the criteria for re @-@ setting of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the website of the organization .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that would give interest to Russia .
&quot; everything has been announced , everything will be implemented .
and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and the WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added .
one of the criteria mentioned in the list shows that the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping authorities approved the results of the WA@@ DA approval by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren to alleged state @-@ sponsored D@@ op@@ ings in Russian sport .
in relation to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we carry out the investigation , since our anti @-@ d@@ oping system has an error .
all measures have been implemented .
but there were no government programs , and we will not ad@@ mit anything that does not exist . &quot;
Mut@@ k@@ os &apos;s words voted with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the head of the independent Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping Commission , agreed .
in conversation with the Russian sale point R@@ sports at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v was added to the past in Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping organizations , but added : &quot; we have said that &quot; we have repeated that the report has controversi@@ al positions and regulations .
no one has to accept this report un@@ conditional , &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v .
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 during the D@@ oping sc@@ and@@ als of the WA@@ DA from the implementation of D@@ oping control in Russia .
it was however allowed to plan and coordin@@ ate tests under the supervision of international experts and UK anti @-@ d@@ oping ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
following a visit to the organization of the organization in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA @-@ General Director Olivier Nig@@ gli declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA stated in the right direction &quot; moves to be used again .
Al@@ di had already sold no eggs more
this divided the corporate groups .
it handles a pure precau@@ tion that could be assumed by no health claims could be assumed in the notification .
from now on , only eggs were delivered to Al@@ di , which have been proven to be neg@@ atively tested on fi@@ brill@@ ant Anti @-@ L@@ äus@@ ler .
Al@@ di would therefore produce clarity and transparency to its customers .
start @-@ ups that will help your company not to become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my salvation wanted to measure the luck at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys did not work .
answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - fr@@ au@@ dul@@ ent .
and even if you knew An@@ on@@ ym@@ ity , some workers did not mourn the process .
&quot; there was simply never consistency and obj@@ ec@@ tivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Company Madison Re@@ ed .
it was sum@@ mon@@ ed to meet people from the outside .
a new race of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is on the wax to help companies to find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licens@@ ing of software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement , it enables businesses to deal with special groups and demo@@ graphic groups , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ n allow to circum@@ vent the C @-@ suite exec@@ u@@ tives and directly turn right to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you have now tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for the persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analy@@ tics system is used by companies to measure collabor@@ ating staff .
Er@@ ret@@ t said that she had a better viewing in what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t .
in addition to the sn@@ ap @-@ poll@@ s and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat map of the company which indicates that units have most complaints and which exec@@ u@@ tives should have low condition - so that you can re@@ drill , why .
companies come to see that at the top of workplace culture , so that you have not been involved in the next U@@ ber , which has been involved in Sk@@ and@@ als since then a former employee has published a blog @-@ mail , which describes a environment of har@@ ass@@ ays , where those who have spoken , have been punished .
for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t , this wish for an overview of a lu@@ c@@ ative business possibility .
the Global govern@@ ance , regulation and compliance sector could own more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion by 2020 , according to the financial technical website let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Denver , Colorado , start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent bad behavior and to recognize , saw an increasing interest and activity beginning of this year in the heart of U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ k@@ re@@ dit .
Conver@@ cent has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tesla .
u@@ ber has recently signed as a client .
how G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ cent company makes customized &quot; Pul@@ s- &quot; Sur@@ vey@@ s to check real time in real time and view the warmth maps of your problem .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line with the cow@@ or@@ able behaviour .
and if the managing director is included , complaints directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; the Court of public opinion has captured the reg@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent .
when a company is found that his employee is po@@ or@@ ly treated or un@@ eth@@ ically , it can experience precious consequences by consumers @-@ boy@@ cott , workers @-@ fluor@@ k@@ tu@@ ation and cl@@ ature , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations , Conver@@ cent has deployed to more than one year to ensure that the employees are aware of politics and procedures , and a simple way to achieve their corporate headquarters .
previously , if a worker wanted to report a problem , he had to submit an additional number or e @-@ mail to the corporate headquarters , a formal appeal and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often an in@@ exhau@@ sting and un@@ comfortable experience , James Vit@@ rano , Ruby TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ Y@@ S General Coun@@ sel , who said , there was no good opportunity to track the complaints of employees .
now , since the company Conver@@ ters allows issues that have been hidden from exec@@ u@@ tives that were sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unknown practices - qu@@ icker and addressed .
&quot; I can closer to these holi@@ stic , 360 @-@ degree view of experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who runs the risk management Group of Ruby Tuesday .
&quot; and we protect our shareholders in employment of employment . &quot;
companies began studying Eth@@ ics , Val@@ ues , and Employ@@ ees &apos;s commitment in 2002 , after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen , due to eth@@ ical violation through the En@@ ron @-@ Sk@@ and@@ al , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media came to their right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the company knew that you did not avoid that their dirty clothes went online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology for monitoring the eth@@ ics , people used hope than a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said he . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ cent offer your software as a service , and load the company with recur@@ ring fees for use in their products .
it is a business model and a chance that will find the approval of Venture Capital investors who have both scheduled start @-@ ups .
Conver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , with which the entire capital raised to $ 47 million .
gl@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought his entire financing to $ 60 million .
this investment is hardly surprising , in view of the connected nature of companies , culture and Venture Capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today the staff of today expect more than so far .
in competitive markets like Sil@@ icon Valley are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects only .
employees want to feel the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated that you will spend your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if men are happy to feel to be in a company , and that the work that you will do is worthwhile to make it stronger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Qu@@ ee Experience in Link@@ ed@@ In which both Conver@@ cent as well as G@@ lin@@ t is used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
investors can reach R@@ end@@ ites when their portfolio company run well . companies are running well , if employees are working and engaged .
if the analy@@ tics @-@ tools need third parties to increase their commitment and commitment to the employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data is important about the employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture .
but the data are us@@ eless if the administrator of a company does not take measures .
in fact , if a company asks people after your feedback , it may have a anticip@@ ation that changes on the way is .
and if the change does not come quickly , or at all , this dis@@ appoint@@ ments and employees can carry out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you have to have been willing to have 4,000 convers@@ ations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting during Business Management Company Kot@@ ter International , which has seen the company too much to collect data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you do not follow the employees , Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
take care of this about it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and whom do you not worry , why should I ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Madison Re@@ ed , who now carries monthly employees now , was able to initi@@ ate action on the same day if a problem is reported via G@@ lin@@ t , so Er@@ ret@@ t .
and after collecting from fru@@ str@@ ated employees , it was able to organize and able to organize several teams in the company &apos;s speed and quality of communication , to add multiple teams within the company and to add a communication training to tackle the problems .
with Ruby Tuesday , the company is getting a new in@@ sights on the employees , and it hopes that at a long point of view , this leads to a better binding of workers in a branch which is known for high revenue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose man , you also lose customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you lose customers , then you will lose companies .
the N@@ CAA elim@@ in@@ ates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the brood @-@ ins
it starts at 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ CL@@ A foot@@ ball@@ ers on one side of the teams are talking on the campus .
some have turned out their mou@@ ths , and show the back full of silence from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team we present a lunch break for a good part of the team .
players who are written down to summer courses will return after the three @-@ hour exercise to return their final examination before they return on the next morning at 6 : 30 a.m. to Aquari@@ us Football Center .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the guys the next three days a genuine T@@ ret@@ mill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before the Monday was Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CAA elim@@ in@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of the player , and it has really extended her days - at least until the final on Friday .
for this reason , the first three trainings of the U@@ CL@@ A should start at 7 : 15 pm to meet the already fully packed schedule of the players .
the compromise between the two days is more than a day when the breaking ceremony was post@@ pon@@ ed almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as &apos;s six play@@ times in West@@ wood practical exercises .
they will hold 18 exercises in the course of August . 20 before the formal game preparations for their pre@@ lu@@ de against Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he under@@ line the control change of the N@@ CAA even if you add a further point of interest in players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put these enormous strain on her three or four days , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they are simply op@@ pressed , they pl@@ aten them , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think once we come to Saturday and we have more time , it really will be great . &quot;
the U@@ CL@@ A will termin@@ ate their practices , as soon as the camp is finished , what was exposed in view of the clear view of his fields from the adjacent parking and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the highest class@@ room , which is a protective network behind a tor@@ rent , no light task will be .
brood @-@ players are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend but Mor@@ a dre@@ amed that there could be a problem once these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; we will set our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far back to think that people can rent there a room and then set it on it to record a practice .
if you have the video from one exercise , it is a pretty good business .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best thing with what we have .
I am not doing so much too much .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit messages
Facebook wants to send more potential items with false messages addressed to the fact and their results under the original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network is on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to combat so @-@ called f@@ ake news .
the company said in a opinion on his website that it will begin with the deployment of updated learning methods to detect possible f@@ ails and to send it to fact that may show results of the original article from the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main part points for so @-@ called f@@ ake news , many of which believe that they also influences the 2016 U.S. presidential election .
the problem also has become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters being floo@@ ded in May with false stories , and Germany shall support a plan to eliminate social media networks , if it does not succeed , h@@ are filled post@@ ings like before the elections there in September quickly .
on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement on German , that in the U.S. , France , the Netherlands and Germany , a test of the new facts review will start .
&quot; in addition to the knowledge that stories of fact @-@ verified third parties want more context to make sure that they read and share , &quot; said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook messages in a blog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook continues to continue its feature &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Test in conjunction with the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and works on other changes to his news feedback to reduce wrong messages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a com@@ ic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squ@@ e@@ eze music video and was for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ s and 1980 @-@ s a hole @-@ hole .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of tur@@ bul@@ ent history of his comfortable seat in the wat@@ ering River Valley in K@@ ent and now has been inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ ha@@ ari@@ gen Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a pre@@ ference for historical documents .
&quot; I think it was so nice to look at the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says we@@ ary .
&quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; moves the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documented the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . every story was illustrated by Isaac Lenk@@ ie@@ wi@@ cz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des , which is based on an archive : he wrote &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection which was inspired by documents in the British library - a project which he was un@@ expect@@ edly found .
&quot; I only responded to the thum@@ b print on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s , which worked for the Jac@@ o@@ bin@@ s , &quot; he says .
&quot; this is his thum@@ b print !
and letters always smell like smoke , because there was a fire in the light of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as it would also be involved .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is defeated so with old pap@@ ules , it is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England , and nearly four months lived in a castle ( &quot; To be hon@@ est : I have a little thought &quot; ) seems to be nice to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days to explore the Vic@@ tor@@ ian &quot; new &quot; castle to explore the archives and study many treasures and cur@@ ios@@ ities of the castle , like about the mounted hy@@ mn of the walls and the bottles , who had spent centuries in the grave .
he emigrated through the premises and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with land care , gar@@ dener and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
then , he drank , &quot; Whis@@ key and began to write . &quot;
Scot@@ ney &apos;s intimate history is relatively unknown , since the National Trust was given the full access in 2006 when the last building , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey died .
when Rho@@ des met a decade later , the employees began to take care of the archives that he spoke as &quot; hundreds of years , in which Arist@@ ro@@ gu@@ ards said &quot; Oh , &quot; it was described in the attic . &quot;
diary , letters from the period of the English Em@@ pi@@ res , maps , which had what had said : &quot; one could think that country conflicts would be bor@@ ing bor@@ ing , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to have fought two families .
guys , let all go his ais@@ le ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to spread on a wider basis in the English history , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man built the newly built castle in order to join the farmhouse of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a record of a ri@@ ot that occurred in 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book with the title &apos; Kn@@ igh@@ tly Famil@@ ies of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pe@@ asant revol@@ ted in this field and I thought a revol@@ t was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;

campaign launched : over 300 years old Marien@@ kap@@ elle covered in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the cover of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Marien@@ chapel in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f started on Friday their campaign to launch a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) .
by Thursday , Mayor Otto N@@ EU@@ HO@@ FF and his marketing team will keep the logo and the slogan .
end of August it will be the cul@@ mination of the campaign to be held on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; to beauti@@ full for us .
or ? , &quot; ask the M@@ acher of action since yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer Chapel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not think of course ! ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not really , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; write them on their yesterday released site . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we ut@@ ili@@ ze this measure to win your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and in order to make clear that some better is better than it seems .
basically , we are the ste@@ ady over@@ generation that we know as bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizens to know the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the promotion , there &apos;s more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is further stated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true that a stand@@ able promise is to form@@ ulate , one that gives the city a distinctive pec@@ uli@@ arity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , they stand in the competition with other municipalities .
a medium @-@ digit amount is possible to charge the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f her new umbrella brand and the campaign costs .
military re@@ forms in Turkey - Erd@@ og@@ ans fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) advis@@ es over retirement and convey@@ ors in the officer cor@@ ps .
so also this week .
at first glance a normal process .
but nothing is routine in the Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt .
the meeting was not held in the Building of the General Staff , as previously , but in the minist@@ erial seat of the prime minister .
under the presi@@ dency of the Heads of Government , the five Viz@@ ep@@ re@@ mier@@ s and the Minister for Defence , In@@ ner@@ ves , Justice and Foreign Affairs .
there were civilians in Y@@ as in number .
the government moves the re@@ ins in the military .
Chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ure of the army , the air@@ crafts and the n@@ avy were removed .
since the failed coup , head of State Erd@@ og@@ an 169 of 326 gener@@ als and ad@@ mir@@ ers fired .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections for the movement of the exile @-@ pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len to see the Erd@@ og@@ an of the co@@ aches of the co@@ aches .
around 486 people who have been involved in the coup attempt would have been involved in Ankara since this week .
already on the day after the coup , Erd@@ og@@ an was called &quot; divine gift &quot; as a gift as he was given to him to de@@ file the forces &quot; completely . &quot;
but did Erd@@ og@@ an really handle the army ?
in late February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ dis@@ comfort in the Military headquarters . &quot;
in the general Staff there is a concern because of an increasing &quot; Islam@@ isation &quot; by the army which mani@@ f@@ ere among other things in the repe@@ al of the case for Sol@@ dat@@ ors , wrote the newspaper .
the large cle@@ ann@@ ess near the army and the security forces continues to move .
in mid @-@ July , Erd@@ og@@ an received a further 73@@ 95 national services , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 546 soldiers .
it seemed to be nar@@ row@@ ed to the military as a Erd@@ og@@ an .
gener@@ als were earlier than the gent@@ l@@ emen of the country .
her role as gu@@ ardi@@ ans of world military order three times pushed her to their role as a gu@@ ardi@@ ans .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erd@@ og@@ an pushed power to power by step , not least by calling for the reform of the European Union .
former officers say , Erd@@ og@@ an is pro@@ gres@@ sing along with an Islam@@ ist armed forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Voc@@ al Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Voc@@ al Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he sought for asylum from persecution against persecution in foreign countries , and the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extrem@@ ists and Sal@@ af@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in few years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is why NATO could not leave NATO in terms of development .
already in the alliance , there is doub@@ ts about the pur@@ ge of the Turkish army in accordance with the cleans@@ ing of the Turkish army .
the exec@@ u@@ tives and operations skills are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; said NATO diplom@@ ats .
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US immig@@ ration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted from the media .
he looks to lower the legal immig@@ rants to 50,000 a year , stric@@ ter regulations for the planning of visa for temporary work permit and restrictions for families @-@ oriented visa .
the new rules are proposed by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , saving and save billions of dollars for the tax@@ pay@@ ers , and will do this by helping the US to get the way to citizens from other countries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent chains migration and replace the current system .
this new candidate procedure is to benefit from the candidates who have the financial resources to support themselves and knowledge the knowledge of our economy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted from the American media .
Ministry to Rest@@ ore track of Rac@@ ial shuttle
once again , during the past months over the future of the racing transporter So@@ utt@@ les have been fought - now it is supposed to go quickly .
even before the end of the year , the tourist line is scheduled to be built , at the end of the year .
in order to secure the future of the racing transporter for the long term , according to the traffic of the road , the course will start at the circuit in this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to order to order the route Ilmenau @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country is primarily important for tourism important connections , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said traffic State Secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs for repair the route driven it to about 2.5 million euros .
of this sum , the country took 75 percent .
the contract , based on the basis of the shuttle , is to be ordered in the future of the country , will be defin@@ iti@@ vely voted , declared S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the southern Railway as a operators are already interested in technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the road@@ map , the used vehicles and the quality standards are done , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
this means that the race will be ordered from the regular bus shuttle to be completed in December 2017 .
the race track shuttle is an especially popular railway connection between the Ilmenau and Renn@@ stei@@ g railway stations .
in the past few months , as part of a pilot project , the distance of enough many people has been used to meet them again in the future .
the route is in parts strongly di@@ lap@@ id@@ ated .
the rise of sex robot is real , and we should worry about it
just as you thought it could not be mad in 2017 , a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robot .
yes , indeed .
sex robot is currently a big thing .
recently published the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robot in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , emer@@ itus status for rob@@ ot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at the University She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we need to start their asc@@ ension .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its form of ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ a@@ gel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people make them funny , but the companies deliver any amount of it , and we will see them much more common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Shar@@ key at the publication of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ editions have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm , with deliber@@ ately human reactions , which are achieved through artificial intelligence .
the user can also adjust his robot according to his belie@@ fs , &quot; and will select everything , from the eye @-@ colour of the robot through the form of chest war@@ ts up to type or colour of its fing@@ ern@@ ails .
but it is still wor@@ r@@ ying , as many robots inherit the &quot; personal@@ ities &quot; which would be a step@@ per woman .
modern S@@ exp@@ o ppen have developed to robots with a silicone skin .
the real Bot@@ ix Ro@@ bot allows for example to adjust its robots to the properties that are appe@@ aling to the characteristics such as rel@@ ap@@ ing .
and then there is still the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robot with pre @-@ programmed personal@@ ities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah &quot; which gives the impression of rel@@ ap@@ ses and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; advent@@ u@@ rous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible , &quot; war@@ ms the site of True Compan@@ ion . &quot;
so , what you like , and they don &apos;t like what you like , etc .
in the course of the day , she also gave their voices - all as real people !
it can be tired , fixed to conversation , or it can be &quot; in mood &quot; ! &quot;
there are many be@@ wor@@ r@@ ying aspects of this ascent of sex robot - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the under@@ stand@@ able female properties that goes to rape , if you go one step towards Fri@@ gi@@ d ( here : resist@@ ible ) Far@@ rah , troubled one at most .
on his website True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men do not have Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; it is on the site .
however , these sex robot is not only a fet@@ ish or just another sex game .
their birth and their increasing refin@@ ement show a slightly dar@@ ker and deeper understanding of our culture , to a withdrawal from the Ideal of gender equality to a desire after sex with sub@@ jug@@ ation as an optional allowance .
as of course , most men will receive no sex robot , and while the FR@@ R ad@@ mits its increasing popularity , they will still remain at the edge of consumer culture .
but what is le@@ ak@@ age out of the border zones , may be in terms of the spirit of time in which we live , very instru@@ ctive .
and many people are not stran@@ gely or min@@ ded , until they are free for the free market .
there is a certain over@@ l@@ apping that these highly developed sex robot in a time , in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide , in which the White House gives an President in which it pra@@ ys women to have sexually mature .
the most terrible aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the handmaid &apos; ) are not the graphic pictures , the un@@ related body and the out@@ och@@ re eyes , but as realistic this vision .
the Republic of Gilead is a jump but in the moment it does not feel like a great jump .
the goal behind these sex robot is to make a physical simil@@ arity to real women as realistic as technically possible ( if also with Porsche star Pro@@ por@@ ters ) .
her awak@@ ens want to feel human being in human being that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , in the point we brought to their &quot; personal@@ ities &quot; the robots do not represent real women .
you can not separate from their companion or simply go away .
they don &apos;t have any medi@@ ation or a background history , nothing , which could mean on independence or anything that could inter@@ rupt the imagination of total under@@ ing .
in other words , you are counter@@ f@@ eit slaves .
or to express it in the spe@@ ech@@ es of 2017 : maid service
tr@@ um@@ ps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to overthrow the healthy human lives
it has become a Bin@@ sen@@ sible of the Tr@@ ump era , that the political sp@@ circuits that have polar@@ ised with US voters , also families in small format .
around Christmas and Harvest in the USA there appeared in the USA &apos;s newspapers including discussions about how to inter@@ rupt the hor@@ ror of Tr@@ ump @-@ relatives .
we str@@ ingent us all supp@@ os@@ edly to test our filter bub@@ bles .
less noticed is the power of Tr@@ um@@ ps , families .
I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ oriented di@@ chter@@ in , who lives in Chicago and has long been visiting with the rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family , has visited me this week in New York .
it remin@@ ded me that the unity can have an enemy effect against a common enemy .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone who knows it , including the Republi@@ can relationship , with whom she had fought for decades , suddenly and very strange on the same side .
in order to make the dining table it is certainly a good thing , but it falls in another context that this also brings significant risks with it .
the lens was strengthened by tr@@ ump , but the effective effect of his presi@@ dency has power to push us all to the right .
if we speak of &quot; Normal@@ ization &quot; and Tr@@ ump , we refer to the gr@@ ate possibility that his bi@@ bs will not be put up one day .
however , there is still a troubled long@@ time scenario , in which Tr@@ ump Rep@@ ublic@@ ans of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alised &quot; which appears suddenly in comparison to its standards as opposed to its standards .
I find myself today from a active nost@@ al@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s com@@ ic version of the back@@ drop - the dog on the Aut@@ od@@ ach , the 14 % income tax ( but at least , we knew how his tax returns ) - both in comparison to Tr@@ ump in fact rather than very mild criminal off@@ ences .
if Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans must be spiritu@@ ally healthy in order to qualify for un@@ meas@@ ur@@ able improvement .
when I was my c@@ ousin in the city , we brought our kids to the Car@@ ou@@ sel in Central Park , the largest of the Car@@ ou@@ sel &apos;s park department , and the best three dollars that one can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cris@@ y and the animals are turning to look full of fear of their own shoul@@ ders - extremely dark and the climate per@@ si@@ zing music thus convey@@ s this attention .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city are disappointed : the views of high buildings are old , the Sky@@ lines are familiar to provide a lot of exc@@ itement , and the reality of the city will not be justified .
five and thirty years later , and I was not yet all over the day , when I found out that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss Cottage - the Top@@ ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not counted - but a large roundabout in the north of London .
the Central Park Car@@ ou@@ sel is still a strange magical experience , since two years old , a 11 year old and two women in the 40 @-@ s can go on it and all have a great time .
when I had to evaluate the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one has asked about it .
on the other hand , I was forced to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same as plus the option to tip the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the shop table .
this does not only lead to a slow@@ down of what should actually be a neutral exchange , but also pressure on the server to put personality into a situation , not necessary .
the poor woman in the department store stood exc@@ itement , while I tired the experience I made my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain from prison to the hospital
Pist@@ ori@@ us has left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time .
last year , he was brought to the hospital because of the treatment of care@@ ers to the hospital , which he suffered from prison authorities after a fall in his prison cell .
pist@@ ol was convicted of murder after an appeal against the prosec@@ uting attor@@ neys for a first total delay .
he killed steak in early morning hours of Valent@@ ino in 2013 by taking them several times through a door to the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ toria on it .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he had hidden his gir@@ l@@ friend for an immediate int@@ ru@@ der who hidden himself in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention , this time against the six @-@ year sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell who they say that they may be too op@@ aque .
the National Prosec@@ ution Authority reported that it would be raised by the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the obj@@ ection could be heard this year .
pist@@ ol runs danger that his penalty will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .

instead of a chicken meal , a little e@@ ag@@ les came out .
but hope to make a chicken cut out of him , struck the eagle spread on a high mountain on a high mountain .
thereafter the classes showed three and four in the rehear@@ sal of Y@@ v@@ onne Frank a chicken .
the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young Go@@ ck@@ les , the cylinder contributed to the bet .
the Adler stand for integration , said train@@ ee Angel@@ ika S@@ itte .
indeed , the young was different as the other young ( ch@@ icks ) , but also belong .
he will never be like a chicken .
his appointment is to be free .
they wish to make every quadru@@ ple that it feels at his new school .
it was followed by grat@@ u@@ word to the colleagues , former school@@ master Michael Müller , who will always jump back with certificate , and the par@@ ental representatives again .
the cu@@ cum@@ ber is now over , stated class teacher Sophia Schumacher .
they leave their pup@@ il after two years of lessons only very ung@@ ers , because it was a really great time .
and finally , on the square you can rely on the quad@@ r@@ ump .
for the closing all students had a song of summer time and summer time .
it broke out with the children of great joy .
eight first year of school have already registered for the new school year .

software update for diesel vehicles : what to know the people now need to know
how exactly will the software update place ?
must diesel drivers have to participate in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .
they are to improve the exhaust @-@ fire behaviour of cars of emissions categories Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 dies@@ els or worse are excluded .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin of ACE Auto Club Europe returns ass@@ ess@@ ments :
is the new action oblig@@ atory ?
no , the negoti@@ ated software updates are voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the oblig@@ atory updates are only valid for the vehicles that have Schumann Member States , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; An@@ ja S@@ met@@ al@@ anine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
its re@@ arm@@ ament is arranged by the Federal Office of the Federal Office ( KBA ) .
how and from when will customer be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers announced a fast implementation in the next months , but does not have any exact date .
Daimler has informed that anyone concerned .
if only an inspection is due , it will be done in their frames .
how long shall the change fit in total ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; S@@ met@@ al@@ anine .
the slopes of the manufacturers of the manufacturer , as well as from the political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for we have seen that the autom@@ akers did not deal with the environment at the topic of the environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long shall the update last ?
the conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time of time , it could be an appointment .
what do car drivers do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ACE would have gone to wait .
probably foreign manufacturers would follow , so s@@ met@@ al@@ anine .
is there a massive pricing of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE fears that .
but just in the regions where there are driving paths .
in rural areas there are no impair@@ ment losses for older diesel engines .
the ACE can still be tra@@ ded with a sale .

traditionally US President Donald Tr@@ ump will stage a reception and attend the ceremony together with his wife Mel@@ ania .
the winner of the Progressive TV series announced that this is why L@@ ear has already announced that participation in the Gala was announced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this presi@@ dency said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this presi@@ dency decided to neg@@ le@@ ct the arts and human rights to neg@@ lec@@ ting them - and imp@@ acted even the funds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

we make the city life
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ master , goes to R@@ ente next year .
the place is already written - suitable candidates are ra@@ r .
since 31 years W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ master has been .
and the work makes it still great fun as he gives to the Press Conference .
he reports from varied but also demanding tasks that wait for his success@@ ors .
at the same time , it ad@@ mi@@ red that so far no application fulfil@@ s the requirement profile .
the town is searching for an architect or building engineer for the next time .
that is to be cont@@ emp@@ t of the regular period of notice - even enough time for el@@ aboration .
since Has@@ lach joined the administrative community as a sub@@ contrac@@ tor , the candidates must submit relevant contracts .
for this function wants to keep the city definitely .
if they could not fill out this no more , citizens would need to go to Offen@@ burg to Offen@@ burg .
but civil law is the city and it itself important , says W@@ acker who reports from a good operating lim@@ a as well as good mood between authority and citizens .
in more than 30 years in ministry , some significant projects have accumulated along the w@@ acker who are proud of pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are making the city life &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he is about the building &apos;s office and staff safely . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , varied projects on the agenda : the transformation of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the low @-@ temperature parking lot are an@@ gled .
the chin @-@ up bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , also the st@@ adi@@ on@@ ful@@ ler is still the topic .
the latter alone will strike at around 1.5 million euros , &quot; if we do it correctly , &quot; it is estimated that w@@ acker .
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my successor .
the work here is fun . &quot;
also available for a Stadt@@ bau@@ master of great play room .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s , its own building yard and a gar@@ dener can be flexi@@ bly re@@ acts on many times .
&quot; one can move a lot , &quot; so w@@ acker , and the design of gre@@ enery will be praised by citizens and visitors often .
since the old town is under monument protection , it is important to have &quot; an eye to do what it fits &quot; when new buildings are approved , re@@ iter@@ ates the out@@ going urban development .
oh@@ ist@@ in carries high responsibilities in the Stadt@@ bau@@ master .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end everything goes on my desk &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for assistance and coordination he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been there for 10 years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) has been in existence for 15 years .
even that his successor remains long , W@@ acker : &quot; we are looking for som@@ eb@@ ody who really identified and remain . &quot;
because continu@@ ity is not only important for a good operating lim@@ a , but also for the more design of the city .
if the Roland W@@ acker would like to inherit the town of Has@@ lach , it should be completed as a diploma in engineering or Bachelor with technical equipment and have good knowledge in the areas of construction and construction planning .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt under@@ stands high and civil engineering , building management , under@@ under@@ growth opportunities , urban tourism board with building yard and municipal jurisdiction , as well as sub@@ contrac@@ tor and sub@@ contrac@@ tor .
thrown on lines : southern route closed
according to the police , the hi@@ ps had so far thrown the blue bicycle from the railway track in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines .
these were badly damaged in such cases that the her@@ al@@ able freight train had to be observed .
the investigations go out of two male perpet@@ rators and look for the night hours after them .
near to the place there were witnesses to a thr@@ ott@@ le tur@@ ally and a bike driver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that goes far beyond a Laus@@ itz &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Ö@@ BB speaker Christoph Pos@@ ch said to A@@ PA . &quot; &quot; &quot;
or the perpet@@ rators have brought itself in danger and also threatened by train traffic .
in addition to the damage to the Lo@@ k and the plant , the last minute and the cost of rail transport , even P@@ X @-@ ray customers could also come to the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a total of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be out of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
damages were fixed on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the southern track could be guided without disabilities .
almost ten staff were fallen on fri@@ day morning , two of them concerned the correspondence .
they did not leave goods , but they did not delay .
according to the Ö@@ BB speaker Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 meters of upper lines had to be replaced .
ins@@ ulators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red me@@ ats , dairy products and chocolate could help IB@@ D ( infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ wel disease )
red meat and chocolate can be used for your digest@@ ive system like a night@@ mare .
but a new study asser@@ ts exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could shor@@ ten the symptoms of patients with anti @-@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ wel diseases .
the un@@ re@@ able condition that affects approximately 1.3 million and in Britain 300,000 , causes gast@@ rop@@ es and ble@@ eding , recur@@ ring or blu@@ epr@@ ints , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while those affected are normally advised , meat and dairy products found that researchers found that the essential amino acid tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an of proteins found that the essential amino acid tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an of proteins , to develop a toler@@ ant intest@@ ines .
the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , stated that immune cells in the intest@@ inal pat@@ rol to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes to hide themselves in the body .
cells that are able to resol@@ ve inflamm@@ ation , are balanced by cells that promote the tolerance and protect the body without sensitive tissue .
if the balance is in the direction of inflamm@@ ation , it has resulted in a infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ wel disease .
in experiments it was determined that a type of tolerance is necessary for mice that use a particular bacter@@ ium in their inn@@ ards .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an - one of the blocks of proteins - to resol@@ ve the appearance of the cells .
Professor Colonna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacter@@ ias - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illus reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the intest@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ oma and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an had the mice in their food , the more had they of these immune cells . &quot;
it proposed that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an rich diet would be toler@@ able , less infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory col@@ os@@ us , if the same system is effective in humans .
the post @-@ doctoral studies Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan searched a kind of immune cell who invented the tolerance when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the tribe that had been stopped , this had not had .
it believes that the difference with intest@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ omes of mice had to do - the commun@@ ion of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ us that usually live on the stomach intest@@ inal tract .
the mice of mice were found DNA sequ@@ enced , and there were six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells , but without them missing in mice .
mice were taken up in a ster@@ ile environment , so that they lack@@ ed a intest@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ oma and they were not developed this kind of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria stim@@ ulated the immune system , researchers investigated L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a liquid and then over@@ led small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells , which were isolated from mice .
the immune cells developed into the toler@@ ant @-@ carrying cells .
when the active component of the liquid has been cleaned , it proved itself as a by@@ product of tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an metabolism that is known as In@@ do@@ l @-@ 3 @-@ lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers have doubled the amount of tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an in the feed of mice , the number of these cells increased by about 50 percent , but if tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ onic values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan said that people have the same toler@@ ant @-@ promoting cells such as mice , and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i protect our stomach @-@ gut tra@@ vers@@ ing .
it is not known whether Tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an side products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i will develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an were found in humans with anti @-@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory illness .
she said : &quot; the development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote , since these cells controls inflamm@@ ations on the inside surface of the screen .
potentially , high tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ onic values might result in the presence of this population . &quot;
Jose Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; gen@@ ius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
at Manchester United has signed a &quot; gen@@ ius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , believes Jose Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut on Wednesday evening his debut against S@@ amp@@ dor@@ ia .
the 40 million pounds of signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the final season game before the UEFA Cup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday , and impres@@ sing in the holder roll , as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira .
however , M@@ atic was excluded from the Prepar@@ ation Asia tour of the blues and was able to pay only 45 minutes , which Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho had to improve prior to the beginning of the Premier League Cup .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a gen@@ ius in the way , as he th@@ inks it , &quot; said Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him earlier than later to be ready . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u was launched in Avi@@ va Stadium as Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho his start @-@ XI to the start of the season .
the Independent unveiled this week that Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho could wish three further comm@@ it@@ ments , but he insi@@ sted that the club has already performed a &quot; fantastic work &quot; to fulfil three of his four priority substances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get three of four , I added to the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four , but they have given great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; painted &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the Silhouette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle in Washington state Washington , but drawing in Marqu@@ ette in US state of Michigan and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometres .
the action took 18 hours and a minute .
on the sh@@ iel@@ ding the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole was a cardio test for new engines .
Boeing had already been made commercial advertis@@ ements already earlier .
thus the number &quot; 787 &quot; and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky .
new draft for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind ceased : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still called the SPD chief , Socialist minist@@ erial prime minister before elections are always with a certain concern to Berlin .
only there is any distur@@ ban@@ ces from the party centre , merely a counter @-@ wind from the covenant - this was the most important desire of the elec@@ toral dam@@ pers .
since Martin Schulz has led the party , has changed dramatically .
since then , the employee from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ House with a growing dis@@ may become the events in the SPD @-@ reg@@ ated capit@@ als .
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year , would not be described in the approach with counter@@ wind .
they were spar@@ es .
and one after another .
according to the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony the Federal CDU sees a general signal against Ko@@ al@@ itions of SPD and Gre@@ ens in Lower Saxony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is once more : red @-@ green can simply be reliable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CDU Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber to the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the surprising Fra@@ ct@@ ance of an Green M@@ EPs launched the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a severe crisis .
five months before the Parliament election , his red @-@ green coalition lost their one @-@ votes majority to the opposition from CDU and F@@ DP .
the Green Party executive manager Michael Kell@@ ner has asked the ab@@ duc@@ ting Lower Saxony @-@ de@@ pu@@ ties , called El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets to return mand@@ at .
the transition to the CDU means a clear de@@ file of voters .
El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets have to return to her mandate , &quot; said the Federal Government and elec@@ toral campaign of the Green Party editor ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody can &apos;t be true &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a SPD election soldier , when on Friday morning , the new hi@@ ob@@ s@@ ard@@ ship has reached the party headquarters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Weil , the German prime minister of Lower Saxony , stands after the over@@ coming of the green @-@ de@@ pu@@ ties of El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets to the CDU without their own government majority .
it is the preliminary cli@@ max of a whole rows of large and small cr@@ ises in SPD @-@ Associ@@ ations .
and no one knows what next comes .
the Mis@@ ere began with an unexpected defeat at the Saarland election in March .
a blue eye , no more , the com@@ ra@@ des that com@@ ra@@ des .
everything will be different after the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia .
that was then - and indeed everything was worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to its de@@ af , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ite turned the party more smooth .
strug@@ gling the com@@ ra@@ des in the weeks afterwards again .
then , when she had exhau@@ sted new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg .
and with him the next spring came .
Mayor O@@ laf Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD Land@@ esch@@ ef , lost his Nim@@ bus at the weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie during his weekend .
and because in the crisis of crisis , it was pretty much wrong , what you can do wrong .
since then Sch@@ olz fought for his political survival .
now also Stephan Weil .
because of the VW @-@ exhaust aff@@ air and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Saxony Prime Minister already existed for longer in criticism .
Mi@@ ese surveys were added .
nevertheless , or maybe even so , because in the past few weeks , Weil tried to set acc@@ ents in the covenant .
the asp@@ ir@@ ation of the former Mayor of Hannover , whose power in Berlin , was not hidden by Martin Schulz as well .
they let him allow him to betra@@ y him as a stabil@@ ization of the party .
now the exact opposite could occur .
in doing so , because on the part@@ ame , the Angl@@ o @-@ Sax@@ on Green is not guilty .
and Schulz does not know .
once again , the com@@ ra@@ des should therefore be closed down to keep his own rows .
her anger is aimed at the gre@@ enery , and in particular attention to the par@@ abolic par@@ liam@@ ent@@ aries in T@@ jack@@ ets .
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and demo@@ cra@@ cies , such as Mr@@ s T@@ li@@ fe@@ athers her own career @-@ barrier over the interests of all other , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , CEO of the party of party in the SPD Bundestag , the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
not because of her person as Director of the Lower Saxony , Ms. T@@ jack@@ ets has not been elected as Director of the Lower Saxony Members of Parliament .
the logical consequence would it be back to her mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , CEO of the SPD Bundestag , compl@@ ained an &quot; un@@ democr@@ atically man@@ oeu@@ vre . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the voters aged four years ago was clear : the People have made Stephan Weil about the prime minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony as a leading candidate for the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , the personal career of a future CDU MPs comprise the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he asked to clari@@ fy the back@@ grounds .
I want to know if there was more or more indications of the CDU Lower Saxony .
conveyor belt for local core III
if you want to return to the years , you can get the nearest support from the country .
in this inform@@ al mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of Ste@@ am city development on Wednesday in sens@@ ations .
at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ in@@ dler had a look back to the so far past .
it has been in sensation areas since 1991 .
at that time , in the san@@ itation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the country Baden @-@ Württemberg has taken over two thirds of the funding amount .
in the renovation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the allowance was still 60 percent .
for Sch@@ in@@ dler the previous renov@@ ations are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is finally important to promote the interior and not only new building areas .
on April 4 , the g@@ overning party of Karlsruhe has received information that there will be a san@@ itation area III .
the sum amounts to 8@@ 33 333 Euro , of which 500 000 Euros from the country , the rest of the church sens@@ ations .
how does a sanit@@ ising area arises ?
you will continue to examine so Sch@@ in@@ dler continue to examine where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are .
but it also plays a role , whether in the planned field at all interest , to be rehabil@@ it@@ ated .
if necessary , the territ@@ orial borders may also move again .
the steak stood on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Keller presented the contents of the federal states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social city &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in whose frame the sand will be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
core of the program are the revol@@ alisation of inner cities , improving the residential and operational conditions and expansion and expansion of infrastructure .
the measures would be subject to obj@@ ec@@ lipse , that is , per property , is carried out .
the rehabilitation area would eventually be specified as a statute .
the approved period for funding has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
however , until September of this year , however , the survey would be carried out once again , in the context of which they received a questionn@@ aire to fill out a questionn@@ aire .
the result should be made possible in November or December , so that in the coming year with the sand .
in addition , Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann subsequently declared that every municipality had to carry out inci@@ dents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about to evaluate the urban abuse and decide when it is renovated and in which extent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will also be registered in the property for the respective plot .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann would come again to sensation , and to make a picture of the situation , she promised .
Got@@ zel stressed , a major success factor for the project is the participation of the participants .
that is why there will be questionn@@ aires who will be sent to citizens over the next weeks and will be completed by the end of the summer holidays .
the yellow questionn@@ aire is the &quot; building and land &quot; bow , &quot; in which it goes among others around the building state and the remedi@@ ation prospects .
in the grey questionn@@ aire , the &quot; household and housing , &quot; details can be made to size , distribution and residents of a living room .
the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; operating bow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is only filling when in the building business premises are operated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it pointed to note that Got@@ zel pointed out that a closed questionn@@ aire cannot be applied simultaneously at the same time .
in addition , new construction work is not eligible .
Sch@@ in@@ dler was still stressed that the distribution of conveying equipment according to the &quot; wind Stop principle &quot; functional - who comes first , m@@ ah@@ lt first .
you cannot reserve a pick @-@ up fee for later . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally , photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; village core II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was shown to make a restoration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for@@ bid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British inventor himself uses a micro@@ chip to come with a hand motion in house and car
a British inventor is the first one in the country , who is equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his home door , and can even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thum@@ bs and index and now offers service for companies and individuals who want to simpli@@ fy your life with technology through its company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he has joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , a consult@@ ative an@@ a@@ esth@@ es@@ ists at the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , closed to ensure that the im@@ plant procedures will be carried out according to medical standard .
the technology resem@@ bles a cats and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. North@@ am wants to change castles at houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for an extra cost of £ 300 per lock .
the married father of one has now been installed both at home and also at his BMW Z4 technology , which starts when his hand is at the wheel .
the advertising costs of the White House cost tax@@ pay@@ ers to thousands
the decision of the White House , a n@@ avy @-@ helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event to fly US production in the last month costs tax@@ pay@@ ers to the military , which were transferred to the TI@@ ME magazine , up to $ 24@@ ,000 .
the green white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One when the President is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American building programmes .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of all 50 countries .
built in Connecticut with a fire from Ma@@ ine , a fire engine from Wisconsin and a forkli@@ ft truck from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , was built next to a yacht out of Ma@@ ine .
the military office of the White House asked the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ ment@@ ary order or FRA@@ N@@ GO , just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn according to records of Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 ) , the unit that is responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I just wanted to realize that you &apos;re aware of this , because it is an unusual event with a high visibility , &quot; the Com@@ man@@ de@@ ur of the H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 wrote on the eve of the event of his superior n@@ aval base for aviation .
the message showed that the helicopter arrived on the South La@@ wn at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , and so long stayed until the lawn was cleared from 18 : 00 to 21 : 00 o &apos;clock in this evening .
note that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , due to the limitation of the service hours a second team would be required for return flight .
the original air@@ crew was located during the helicopter , while the security personnel remained on the ground during the time while the plane remained on the ground .
from the TI@@ ME available , it did not clear whether the second flight was required .
on Brands Hatch , Bundes@@ ange@@ ment proposes to use government property for political purposes .
datas@@ ets show that H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 asked whether the event could viol@@ ate the determination .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question that we asked if it was a violation of the Hatch acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are shut up , &quot; answered the Deputy Commander . &quot;
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated the White House as an official event and would not be covered by Hatch Act .
but the official events also have political upper ones .
at the event , the president gave a thrust for the reform of health reform that was in the Senate , and he prop@@ ag@@ ated the efforts to stim@@ ulate the government provisions .
the use of a plane which is known as Marine One or Air Force One , from the polit@@ ically advant@@ age@@ ous purposes it is hardly a new phenomenon .
Pre@@ sidents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but their use only for a photo operation is unusual .
Tr@@ ump led a study in February , when the Presi@@ dential airplane stood before the background of his first campaigns in Melbourne , Florida , Tax@@ i@@ services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compl@@ ained about the use of the Presi@@ dential aircraft by its predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is excited by the show &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deputy Commander of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 crew often lead training tours in the area around Washington and the South La@@ wn in order to depos@@ e the US President in the White House with precise centi@@ metres .
as Tr@@ ump at the beginning of July at the G20 summit in Germany , H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 led to the White House in 58 exercises .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event counted at the training needs of the flight crew for the month , a civil servants said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter units flew an additional 11 hours to this day for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said that the tax@@ pay@@ ers took the load to no other pro@@ ps that were presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky said that the company would not have been involved in the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 does not maintains a budget for presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ ari@@ zation of the US Ministry of Defense for the financial year 2017 , the Do@@ D replacement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D , however , is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight .
notes of the unit recorded flight time of aircraft more than 30 minutes from the &apos; Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House argu@@ ed that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers based on estimates for the creation rate is highly ir@@ re@@ leader , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs which are included in the annual means . &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 included the creation rates for Do@@ D does not include personnel costs , but take into consideration the costs for fuel , maintenance and contract .
at this time the former spokes@@ man of the White House , S@@ ean Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the action of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present these week things in America , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connecticut are very proud to contribute to our national security , and I go that hundreds , if not even thousands of people depend on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have un@@ ti@@ relessly .
of course , it is appropriate to raise it . &quot;
it was not clear if Tr@@ ump , with the helicopter , when he entered his tour over the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire brig@@ ade .
in the White House , Tr@@ ump is a representative of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and scher@@ sleben with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky very good , &quot; said the President , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss for tri@@ cky task

the TC Blue @-@ White Ne@@ uss will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m. in Kiel on the Tab@@ or third Su@@ ig@@ dor@@ fer SV .
despite five games still mac@@ ell@@ os@@ er balance , the top re@@ iter of the Second Tennis Cup has received the sense of reality .
team director Mar@@ ius Z@@ ay has any respect before the opponent .
&quot; this is a compact team that plays in quite similar formation .
just at the rear positions I find the crew very well . &quot;
for class and stability while Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer SV provide all imports from the high North .
&quot; their Danish and Finn@@ s can even refer to inserts in the Davis Cup .
and they are also strong in the double , &quot; says Z@@ ay with views of Har@@ ri Hel@@ i@@ ova@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ör@@ en and Es@@ ben Ol@@ ese , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ re@@ h@@ us ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; it will be difficult for us . &quot;
there you also need a good portion of happiness . &quot;
the ninth team for the trip in the high North is practically .
his debut for Blue @-@ White could be Maxim@@ e Jan@@ 4 .
it is currently converting at the Ch@@ allenger tournament at the Italian Bi@@ ella active Fr@@ ench@@ man in the Italian Bi@@ ella tournament , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) won his first use in this season at the Czech Liber@@ ec tournament in the Czech Liber@@ ec tournament .

how America the OMV damage can damage
indeed , Donald Tr@@ ump did not make his signature under the law of forced sanctions against Russia as a Wednesday evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his de@@ fle@@ ction the law was en@@ acted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I signed a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ constitutional rules &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reaction from Moscow also was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels re@@ cl@@ ed against the US dollar .
after all , the draft stip@@ ulates that European companies are re@@ pen@@ alties that help the Russians to build gas ep@@ ipel@@ ines into the EU .
since then , investors have been en@@ forced to investors in local OMV , co @-@ financed with other European firms the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea North Stream 2 .
the drug is enormous .
nevertheless , it is too early for an assessment of consequences , so the official statement of the oil company .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump even had to raise the sanctions even by an executive order .
twelve weapons are available from him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been viewed , which the group could decrease and who really could do it . &quot; &quot; &quot;

role back@@ ward : the city represents 46 kitchen aids
the city organizes the K@@ ita lunch break again .
with solid contacts for the children and one of the assignment to the team .
the watch is turned back in urban kinder@@ garten .
on 1 September the city of Kre@@ feld will take over the care supply in the urban kinder@@ garten facilities ( Kit@@ as ) again .
for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , Deputy Head of the youth aid , this is good news : &quot; we are all very pleased . &quot;
the bo@@ iled is still cooked except house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and supplies fresh@@ ly cooked ch@@ illed .
the city runs in the area 46 kinder@@ garten sites , in 44 children will get a warm meal during lunch time .
2,@@ 800 children were at the tables in the past Kit@@ a@@ year and the demand is constantly growing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are not only children who are taken care of 45 weekly hours in the ca@@ ita &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Pom@@ mer@@ anz explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the offer is also valid for 35 @-@ hour supervision , if children remain until 14 pm . &quot;
46 jun@@ c@@ ists have served from the 1st of September Chef : they warm the food supplied food , complement it for let@@ tu@@ ce , raw food and fruit , por@@ c@@ ate the meal individually , cleaning the meal , cleaning , washing and clean the kitchen .
&quot; the employees will be assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; Pom@@ mer@@ anz says .
the size - there are two group@@ ed as well as sevent@@ een other facilities - decides about the hour &apos;s volume .
&quot; the kitchen workers now belong to the K@@ ita @-@ Team , &quot; says French .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are much stronger , and it is easier to implement co@@ stly and ped@@ agog@@ ical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this reason it &apos;s about : healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; the children should help to prepare food . &quot;
direct connection of the kitchen strength to the team is very useful .
also for the children .
&quot; they have an known force in the K@@ ita , a person who is entrusted to them and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continu@@ ity is important for children .
the pur@@ ge of the K@@ ita rooms - thus also the task of the kitchen fields - is now being done by special cleaning agents in the future .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides the quality improvement of the kitchen performance also has the charm , which it is equal to the cost between own stock and foreign currency for the city as the most economic development , it is from the press office .
and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are set to be set .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , these hours fall at around 750 people in the educational field not so strong in weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
election may only be representative , if all members of the Society , including women , a role , said the chief of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ s@@ om , reig@@ ning head of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women during the provinces of the provinces are di@@ versi@@ fied . three women can@@ en@@ codes for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ thrown , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections can only be really a representative and believ@@ able if women are un@@ restricted and included in all parts of the choice .
Afghan elections for the Provin@@ cial Council and the Presi@@ dential elections will take place on April 5th .
the Taliban released thre@@ ats against an election process that coinci@@ des with the transition from international mar@@ tial arts to an ad@@ visory role .
this year , elections for the first time will be able to power the power of peace@@ fully by a democr@@ atically elected government .
Hay@@ s@@ om said , a strong role for women will strengthen the democratic success of Afghanistan .
the af@@ ore@@ an independent elec@@ toral commission reported that 1,2 million women have registered 3.6 million voters in total .

G@@ MB concern regarding investments in the Mc@@ Vit@@ ie factory in Glasgow
a union who wants to make a union of the Bis@@ c@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vit@@ ie has a long @-@ term commitment to production at Glasgow factory in Glasgow .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company was silent on the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
more than 500 employees work in the plant , which are built next to other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea K@@ ek@@ se .
Mc@@ V@@ ities owner Pl@@ adi@@ s said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be experienced , if their activities would change their activities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a letter to the company &apos;s branch manager , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vit@@ ie &apos;s to make the concerns that the financing of production lines are not pre@@ powered . &quot;
G@@ MB @-@ Senior Organis@@ ator Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we cannot win no clarity on the future requirements and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross .
generations of families have worked here and the workers are concentr@@ ating on local community and large area Glasgow , a crucial pillar for de@@ cent employment in an area of high unemployment and social dis@@ advant@@ age@@ ous .
therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosper@@ ity , and in the background of the Bre@@ x@@ ite , the increasing life sector and the chronic production process , the eastern end of Glasgow ur@@ gently need a flor@@ ist output equivalent at Mc@@ Vit@@ ie . &quot;
a spokes@@ person from Pl@@ adi@@ s said : &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross has only received a letter of G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will react directly to them since we appreciated the ongoing commitment of employees and trade union representatives .
we had two months ago a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were discussed .
we are talking with the employees that we are like all the companies working in an extremely competitive and un@@ certain economic climate , check our shops constantly - and this is valid for all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last few years we invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , particularly in production lines and operating improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognize the Legacy of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site and completely . if our processes run at the location , the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
has the PS@@ G Barcelona been warned about three years ago ?
the site of La League likes her interest to Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Germain will not release in their persecution by N@@ ey@@ mar , after having issued an offer of £ 189 million , but have been warned of Barcelona prior years prior to the world record ?
the sensational approach has the transfer window in summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than the double of the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United last season .
after the completion , N@@ ey@@ mar is the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional sport@@ s@@ men in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is w@@ ager over the way , as N@@ ey@@ mar has moved his way to the outside , although a source near the Catal@@ ans Management Board insi@@ sted that the club has always been his best to worry about it from Santos in 2013 to take care of him .
but was the football world began three years ago from the PS@@ G President in front of this view ?
as Manchester City 2014 admitted to the signature of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , Nasser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for any organisation , who wanted to sign up one of the best players from PS@@ G .
&quot; I am not concerned , knowing that if they touch one of our players , we will contact opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; we respect all Clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign up one of our players , then this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line , with the Spanish society at the beginning of this summer interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti express .
PS@@ G clearly explained that they would not allow it to leave the International from Italy , in some circumstances , and Barcelona was able to feel the consequences of this process by losing their price for N@@ ey@@ mar .
thrown and damaged
during the night of Friday to Saturday , a unknown do@@ er saw a look at the Royal fields in front of the estate No. 30 , and so on the covering of the vehicle atomic damage caused by more than 200 euros .

on Thursday night the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ L@@ occ@@ um ended with his VW at 19.@@ 55 on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au , coming towards Le@@ ese .
in the area of the area of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a car on his lane came to meet him , so that he had to sof@@ ten to the right .
the tour driver touch@@ ated the console plan@@ ks .
there was an atomic damage on the passenger cars .
the driver of the opposite passenger car , a Mercedes Benz launched a truck and continued its journey without taking part in the traffic accident .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report appro@@ ves pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report to the mis@@ siles reli@@ eved Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the mis@@ use par@@ and@@ al at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen plant will continue for discussions .
Christian Bel@@ ts , spokes@@ man of the reform movement , &quot; We are Church , &quot; declared a publication from the former Reg@@ ens@@ burger Bishop and today , Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of Pope Benedict XVI .
it would serve the view of the Catholic Church , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would have their deepest regre@@ t about their own sub@@ missions or their in@@ con@@ stric@@ ting assessment of operations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ized that in coverage over violence against the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen station with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; measure &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in regard to the off@@ ences in Regensburg , no one knows that it would have to stick to &quot; sh@@ ly and corrupt deeds &quot; until the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ eth@@ ics Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the An@@ hab@@ ility , the Catholic Church as a source of all evil , is already part of everyday experience and prepared for the public opinion that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also the Princip@@ ality of Th@@ urn and Taxis said in an interview with Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk : &quot; we are happy to go on to the church and this is a carved fres@@ co@@ es . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , she pointed out that in their adolesc@@ ence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a completely normal educational means &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to work with children , as I was one was ready to be ready . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are un@@ fair , today set standards for earlier decades , because the world has changed .
in connection with reports about the mis@@ siles , pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
fully un@@ expect@@ edly , the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who translated with R@@ atz@@ inger the reminder &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says E@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report written by the dioc@@ ese of Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment attor@@ ney Ulrich Weber ?
a total of 5@@ 47 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ ago@@ atzen were victims between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , with a high sensitivity &quot; victims of over@@ taking , 67 cathedral spar@@ rows are sexually ab@@ used .
in the final report , it says to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; briefly , that of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. has been applied in many cases of physical and psych@@ ic violence .
at high quality , the punishment for the pupils could also fall more intense .
in contrast to many other accused , many victims were estimated that many victims are estim@@ ating the general crime of R. , and therefore , in numerous cases , some cases have even positive memories with him . &quot;
in an interview , E@@ emann , why the final report on the abuse of abuse during the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger declared his opinion .
Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report about the &quot; inci@@ dents of failure to failure at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; gives a contra@@ dic@@ tory image by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
for one lifting many students his &quot; humanity . &quot;
on the other hand , it appears as a chol@@ ker and perfec@@ tion@@ ist that the Ö@@ f@@ teren could be handy when a cathedral kit had no top performance .
how are you better than his biograph@@ er of this final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you read the trouble and read all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back , one has to ask if the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is at all in it .
only eight pages dedicated to him and it is clear from any suspic@@ ion of the medi@@ a@@ - or wi@@ per in the horri@@ ble cases sexual abuse .
also the non@@ violence at the pre@@ school took place outside of its effectiveness .
you can submit it to him , of it too late or have not taken its first clear@@ ances .
the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ ym@@ nas@@ ium , in which he worked , was taught by practically all those surveyed als - &quot; salvation , &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
it portra@@ ys the vast majority of his student Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , a very excellent testimony , describes it as &quot; warm &quot; , &quot; well , &quot; a competent teacher , who provided the guys regularly with cake , bis@@ cu@@ sen and bon@@ b@@ ons and were &quot; always surrounded by grapes from children . &quot;
merely a minority is worth knowing about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high quality motiv@@ ating that led to w@@ ut@@ out even sometimes .
that he didn &apos;t only threw himself with chairs , and threw the key@@ ring on the ground , but also for fr@@ ying guys to the hair or ears , he has already been abandoned even years ago , being deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it .
however , in its honour of honour , however , such correc@@ tive methods in the frag@@ ile time , the 1960s and 1970s , were widely used , with parents as in teachers .
do you still know such a ch@@ oral methods ?
of course , I think each of us was born before 1968 .
I also have experienced that yet in a world @-@ wide school , a state gram@@ mar school .
compared to what actually happened in this report , namely the de@@ form@@ ative sexual abuse and the violence at the pre@@ school , we are happy .
there is one wonder if it doesn &apos;t have to do with his acquain@@ t@@ ness and his role as brother of Benedict XVI , that many media fell on him .
at the Bavarian Pope , yes , many who have never understood it , still al@@ um@@ ble .
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
the media was reported in connection with the report much about abuse during the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen station .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the final report also any consideration or knowledge of sexual abuse within sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : quite clearly no .
no one of 67 victims of sexual violence claims to have committed himself to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consecrated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never got me to speak with my father or my mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embar@@ r@@ assing for me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem in the En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment of sexual abuse was and is that most victims were silent .
if they trusted not even parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , they definitely did not make a ch@@ oral manager who had been working for a colleague of the perpet@@ rators .
how do I rate the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen student R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ ed student formulated this way : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case , in which he would have been counting ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) and could have stopped the respective perpet@@ rators .
I hold it ... also for really ab@@ sur@@ d , to assume that it was counting ... Bu@@ ben int@@ ru@@ ding or more clear@@ er , than against their parents , inter@@ nat@@ s@@ als , Confi@@ dence Te@@ aching etc .
that one speaks with him about sex ... - un@@ th@@ ink@@ able . &quot;
thus , the report says to the very clear result : &quot; that in the preparation of the affected students and / or their environment , could not be confirmed in the context of the study . &quot;
as sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is therefore accessible by every participant .
so it can &apos;t be cast out , not prevented him or have brought him to the ad .
therefore , there is no reason to bring his good name with these conflic@@ ting crimes , as unfortunately happened in some cases .
in the media there was a lot of &quot; non@@ violence &quot; at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen station .
Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger will be presented in the report .
do he have to live with this alleg@@ ations ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that in coverage all miss and men@@ men@@ tia for a giant mel@@ ange from sexual abuse and non@@ violence and somewhere , in the middle of the Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but that &apos;s exactly what is a mis@@ use of the report .
since it is clean separately : between the school and the gym@@ nas@@ ium , between sexual abuse and non@@ violence , we say once , rest .
in addition , the report deals from the time since 1945 , thus from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ orus master of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen station .
the whole horri@@ ble test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases where boys of sa@@ dist@@ ic teachers were controlled and painted , were all performed on the pre@@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ and@@ al states have to rule .
but with whom he had nothing to do with them , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys only at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ ym@@ nas@@ ium .
it was on the same as the very most witnesses , the theme of &quot; Pre@@ school &quot; tab@@ oo .
one was only happy to escape all of you and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; par@@ a@@ we &quot; states .
what was different at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ ym@@ nas@@ ium ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : because there was discipline in discipline , but no sa@@ dist@@ ic violence .
and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , where the report was to conclu@@ de that &quot; many victims are estim@@ ating the general crime of R. estim@@ ations and therefore , in numerous cases , despite violence even positive memories of it . &quot;
at the most , the charges still remains to have been carried away .
but despite all efforts , the report was able to define only two periods in which it was reported by the state in the school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish itself and from their predecess@@ ors at a school that he had not worked and responsible for himself ( as the witness ) did not want to hear , and then again around 1993 .
shut down Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ahead of the states consistently the ears ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 , he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ ym@@ nas@@ ium , which even re@@ produced the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this regard he reminds us that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will continue to be pract@@ ised in the pre@@ school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
already in face of the risk of negative pres@@ cription .
it was , of course , at that time , as legal clarity , were banned as a test re@@ pen@@ alties in Bavaria .
before , they took place in a legal gray zone , as everyone knows of us .
it was also difficult for him to estimate that the person concerned may ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated or dra@@ g@@ ised , where truly the allow@@ able border was exceeded .
but it can &apos;t say , he would have gone aside .
that is not right .
only in 1980 the test penalty was officially abolished in Bavaria .
the Princip@@ ality of Gloria of Th@@ urn and Taxis claimed that it is un@@ fair to use today &apos;s educational standards at that time .
how do you see that ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : we &apos;re talking about the &quot; Fall@@ u@@ ck of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; so the danger that is past to vote in today &apos;s moral standards .
the prin@@ cess has quite right .
but this is not true for sexual abuse , which was ab@@ ou@@ ched at all times , and not for what was broken down in pre@@ school and violence against innocent children &apos;s ri@@ mp@@ s , that goes far beyond that .
this is all horri@@ ble and I &apos;m glad that it is finally working .
but at the same time I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , for all that had nothing to do with him .
his means to discipline and Pun@@ ishment , i.e. ear@@ chers and ears to draw , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment is then forbidden , he has also kept stri@@ cken in it .
which photo of his Reg@@ ens@@ burger is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , for talks with you for the book &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; ?
came the subject of testing subject to language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedict XVI , tells of his perspective , as the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen station played only one part .
nevertheless , I did not utterly abol@@ ish that he was a thor@@ ough reg@@ iment there .
but this also has to be said : without these perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without creating un@@ conditional discipline , it would probably hardly be possible to form a real cultural ambassador in Europe and his musical tradition , which went straight to the US twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with K@@ ek@@ sen and Bon@@ b@@ ons alone , one makes no big singer once again and before each success , equal to what area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ inv@@ ig@@ ning .
what kind of man did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks about their book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : I learned about the work on the book and in addition I have experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really quite well and always experienced again as wonderful , hum@@ orous , basic , deep faith and heart @-@ good people , of whom you could not imagine that he could do something wrong with a fly .
I regularly get back to him , as many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen plant still today , 23 years after his Emer@@ gence , regularly visit him - he is almost blind - and him will treat him as a member of their family .
those who have not given him until today that he was once a strictly part of them , thus clearly are in the minority .
most Dom@@ ago@@ das are than@@ k@@ ful to him today that he en@@ riches their lives and to them the world of music .
and that he is always a good , v@@ aul@@ ted teacher - a str@@ ingent father , certainly that may be - but also a lov@@ able Resp@@ ect , to which she still watch to see today and honour her .
and , at once again : everything that you should pre @-@ cast into him are correc@@ tive methods that were at the time of the agenda .
we can be happy that we have already taken this time from time to time .
but it is highly un@@ just , a man , just because he is promin@@ ently and has a more prominent brother to make a medicine of sin .
there is evil intention , just behind it , only too obvious .
because the report that was just released , re@@ lie@@ ve him .
now the An@@ dri@@ er command would have acquired a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who had acquired great mer@@ its and without leaving outside of Bavaria and perhaps in Germany nobody would probably know the Reg@@ ens@@ ky Dom@@ sp@@ atzen station , finally in peace .
