<seg id="3">A message chapel, where the tunnel is dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners economies the unique reason of peasants.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official card of Münker supports exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is nervous when land cards are not current.</seg>
<seg id="7">This knows anyone who had to go excitement, because the Auto-Navi took place instead of a straddling street with a green meadow.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bayern Atlases, an offer of the geoportas in Bavaria, the state government, are all other than currently, but is therefore extremely complex.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when you compare it with current online maps.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is clear how cities and municipalities in the spread-area of the Munich Merkur have changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern Atlas is a tapestry carpet, which is not the same as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the vast survey card for cities and municipalities in more detailed maps, so-called uranium leaves.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were developed according to the Bavarian State Building Administration between 1810 and 1864 and jump to the first surveying of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your clients: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the spring of 1800 the French army officers occupied Bavaria since the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic recording of Bavaria in order - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Finally, when the French troops finally absent from Lunéville of February 9, 1801, it was the present neighbors who created the idea of an area-decked Bavaria card.</seg>
<seg id="18">Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph drove the project ahead, founded the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian government management.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Bavarian State Gazette for Munich dates back to 1856 and is how to find all others on the Bavarian State Library's website.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of early he / today is the national capital of the most impressive.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded into all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is subsendling that is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Shipling was used 21 years after the map of the map, i.e. 1877, is meant as a Munich district.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling is situated in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses were concentrated around 1856 along the current Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the Bavarian farmers in Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the West park is, you can see nothing as fields - at first glance: when enzooming a smaller card with dozens lines and numbers: handwritten notes from the so-called "Urabsorption" from which the property tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">Little pitches are present there today no farmers - but small gardeners of the plant "Land in Sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is situated north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, in the 19th century, Theresienwiese, had actually a meadow - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the prototype of the present district Au-Haidhausen, one read only the road names, "or from the Anhight" on the fan "- but also in large letters" err old ones. "</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here on the exhibition street there once unlocked people with madness.</seg>
<seg id="33">There was in 1858 / 59 the Munich circle-Irish prison "On the Auer fan."</seg>
<seg id="34">In 1872, Dr. Bernhard headed the establishment of the establishment of the psychiatrist who was brought to the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was advanced for his time and finished for example the craters of the so called mistaken." ""</seg>

<seg id="37">For 280 patients was first place, later was extended to 500 seats.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sometime, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the foundation for the construction of the circulatory plant in hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Isar-AMPER-Klinikum Munich-Ost is one of Germany's largest psychiatrist in Germany since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">The territory of the former Auer Anstalt participated in the Munich Salesianum in the area of the former Auer Anstalt.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920, and turned him to a youth shop with training.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is the football field of the TSV Munich East, east of the village of the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built in an architectural based on the country of origin of the Irrenprison, which was destroyed during WWII during the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="44">The Marienplatz was held in 1856 as "head place," the shopping street called "Kaufinger alley."</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change brought the Second World War in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombers of the Allies were pulled up a lot of holes in the city centre in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A great remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a greeting-chapel from the Middle Ages were once at the Marienhof, where these days were working, and on 5 April 2017, the groundbreaking ceremony will take place for the second S-Bahn main track.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider, the old Munich-map can be compared with the aerial photo of today and fill up the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Group published a rice idea for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Union for the promotion of colored colored has issued a warning for colored people who travel to Missouri due to discriminating policy and racial attacks.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory Board for the State of Missouri, which to come into force by August 28, 2017, invites us to bring special attention to the state of particular attention, as a series of fragile, road-based incidents in the last time and will be noted," says it in the opinion of the Group.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recent law of Missouri, which makes people heavy to gain discrimination, as well as the prosecutenforcement agencies of the state who target disproportionately on minorities, the group, the NAACP, said the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have violations of the civil rights that people pass.</seg>

<seg id="56">"we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard."</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the US.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited events such as racist struggles against black students at the University of Missouri and death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died in fragile circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no gasoline in custody during the journey, and by the police of Missouri, without any crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also refers to a recent report by the Office of the General Prosecutor of Missouri, which is shown that black drive in the state will be 75 percent more frequently than the White.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware, and their families, friends and employees inform about what could happen in Missouri," "" "said Chapel." ""</seg>

<seg id="64">The rice-armament is an answer to a new Missouri law, which it would become more difficult to accuse a company for residential or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel agencies for Texas and Arizona, after the States immigration authorities to undertake people because of immigration, which will contribute to the ACLU to further reinforces.</seg>
<seg id="66">Reisewarities are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but in the last time stakeholder groups have set the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">Weifence project is Elementar</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischerbacher Weifence-Project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Bundestag filed Peter White and Kordula Kovac took a picture in front of the place.</seg>
<seg id="70">In the court yard of the Schwendemann family, the representative of the Fischerbacher met in the CDU area together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann initially granted insights into his operation in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as many young animals, and houses in five apartments.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" Black "" "" black milk "" "" is the alternative way for the milk of its cows, so Schwendemann. "" "</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the tourist guests there are only regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">As it is also the HV-Chairman of Fischerbach, he called the Weifence project as "Elementar."</seg>
<seg id="75">I can not generate nonprofit economies on derart.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green space for much work, much must be machined with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have here with the terms and topography" "" "was stressed by Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he acquired the elongated operation and supervised this without chemical plant protection and fertilisers, even if it does not lead a biocidal operation.</seg>
<seg id="79">Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear: "the municipality has recognized the significance of the electric fence and is happy about the leader funding."</seg>
<seg id="80">For the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare, farmers will have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">One hope that the view of the surfaces could still be pulled out for a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have, are the people who work in agriculture and will make thoughts about how they continue their operation," "" "stressed the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">The farmers are often due to support in criticism</seg>
<seg id="84">Over the electric fence, a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The retention surface is thus 40 hectares, which cannot be forged until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Of the total cost of 71 500 euros, half of leader was funded by leader, a quarter carried the community of fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus the farmers had to invest €12 610, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of electric fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," stated Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">Kordula Kovac stressed: "you do not make a good job, without farmers and concession doesn't go."</seg>
<seg id="90">Also for Peter White: "the best food products are produced here."</seg>
<seg id="91">The rural conservation line (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the state support of fences of fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to disclose the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">Prerequisite is the presence of one of the LPR carriers.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the incriminating surface must not be frowed, (Hanging ascent above 35 percent) and must be threatened by landing.</seg>
<seg id="95">For the 2018 Auerbacher Weifence project, the request of eight participants will run with 24 plots, which would like to build almost 16 kilometres per fence.</seg>
<seg id="96">The area of disclosure corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is now taking up the Statue of Liberty before</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">Americans estimate the same as any other - therefore the failures of Saddam Hussein's performance on the Firdos place in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the trump regime, knew quite what he did when he took a symbolic figure in an heatonic battle with Jim Acosta of CNN on the proposals for the drastic limitation of the legitimate immigration to the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller did not handle the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boasters and Liberty-Imitators would have compassion for him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he attacked their significance, and in particular the importance that it was attributed to her, when the famous poem was added by Emma Lazarus, 17 years after the completion of the monument, its base was added.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller wrote Acosta: "I don't want to enter a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that lightens the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem, which was added later, was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is right properly, but how he formulated it himself, does not really go about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary resonance to the shakeup words of Lazarus, the only one in which a state does not only load any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your labor, thy poor, and your oppressed masses, which looked after that are free to breathe, / the end waste of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time in which the" "" "elende" "" "was better to see on our screens." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict on the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural conflicts: it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who were interested in placing their words after their death at the base - knew very good that they were able to complete a high political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicans by applying them in an unused classical presentation of the feminism of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus also changed this meaning: in its poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she herself is a very different name: mother of the Exilant.</seg>
<seg id="116">The combination of the image with the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the US Nativity.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus had changed the significance of the statue, they wanted to change the people from the right wing.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great cry of Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty could not invite, but rather an early Neoconvoy, which will bring the American flame into the world: "Lady Liberty continues.</seg>
<seg id="119">It is supposed to bear the torch of freedom from the United States in the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch shall not shine on the way to the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual, Limbaugh starts to something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is quite and even a question of the standpoint of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative indeed of Lazarus was therein, they looked so to see how they were seen by the troubled, but hopeful people after long and often terrible trips on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "" "" "it is true in the true sense that the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and improve their lives." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue says to them the words of hope and of the welcome that they must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And this is not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever would like to recognize.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch shall not shine the way, but the hatred, which is the only source of power.</seg>

<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, among them Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who can compete against Sir Mo Farah at the 5.000 m distance, while Eilidh Doyle was elected team member.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Her captains of surrender was incredible, "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a series of athletes, whether they were Scottish or, wherever they live or practice, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.</seg>

<seg id="161">The father of our land knew something from bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers beat him because of everything, from internal policies to its political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He left the critique of criticism, safe.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he didn't put his critics to silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "because in the year 1783 Washington said:" "" "Free Speech can be taken away - and, stupid, and dumb we are led like the sheep for slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan who needs to work more than Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and had deleted their opinion on its official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And in the beginning of this week, the American Civil Liberties Union mourned him as a result of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The staff of the Governors dismissed the complaint as a fries, and the online comment was full of a counter action with "Na," and?. "</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is only Facebook," said many people.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it's especially important when it is a type of hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary pinion.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown strong hand at the leadership of his state and stringent compliance with principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very sent to use Facebook as a primary means to connect to its voters and play his hair-loose head to chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the blocking of persons who come across the governor's side - which is a public forum which is officially designated as officially and by employees who are paid by public tax-Dollars - unnecessarily and eventually dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post Office Amelia Chasse deprides the actions of the governor and argued that the blocking of comments was nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it's too easy to use the image of uncontrolled or moist people or huts filled people who make the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post said with some of the real people blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are just real people who speak with their chosen leaders, a teacher, a businessman, and a priest, no tiring.</seg>

<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in previous time when you have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical mission articles and to burn them to burn them to silence or to silence.</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trumps appointed a new Chief of Staff to restrict the media coverage of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and are failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If yes, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">POLITICO claims that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to restrict the information flow on President Trump - including reports of the news media - in hope to keep the boss on an even higher course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">When John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, said to his first working day with leading employees, he set up a main problem in President Donald Trumps White House which he would like: bad information that would come into the hands of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly said the staff that information should flow through him - whether on paper or in writing, because the President would meet better decisions when he would receive good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Waitys diagnostic makes sense, but others have tried to narrowate Trump by monitoring its media management.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps relationship is enough to go to television for decades - and now, where he is in the White House, its TV advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"when Trump was cancelled due to unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he was a fair coverage of places that were to convince," said the former election adviser Sam Nunberg in February opposite POLITICO.</seg>
<seg id="1399">Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to hold trumps Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign civil servants there is to ensure that his personal media consumption contains a steady lobster prize."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps Twitter habit ever "was under control, is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps this campaigns could not know what we don't know that Trumps Tweets could not contain more ignition material without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We probably will never experience anything about the tweets that Trump does not have.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his employees create it, some times were able to keep trouble by him, then his efforts have been worth it.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently preventing it, that Trump's controversies appear.</seg>
<seg id="1406">A part of the problem exists that people are involved in a White House which deals with competing parties, always trying to present their own agenda by bringing them of Trump material, which may potentially enhance their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">POLITICO - deals with this story - reported on the preference of advisors, President of strategic reasons, doubting for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example that was described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump leaders say that Trump can react to negative press cuts, especially those with damaged Lecks, and that it comes out to find out how they come from.</seg>
<seg id="1410">This happened at the end of February when somebody gave a printed copy of an article of GotNews.com, the website of the Internet Provokateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the Deputy Chief of Staff of Katie Walsh, "the source behind a cluster of his" Lecks "at the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson has been banned from Twitter permanent evidence that he had no specific evidence or that he had sold false allegations in the past, and has contradicated them.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and began to inquire at Walsh. "</seg>
<seg id="1413">Goldmacher added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to manage and document the trump."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did it work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do three months later, the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove more effective as Priebus as Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his adviser are still under influence.</seg>

<seg id="1480">In Russia's affair to US President Donald Trump is said to have appointed Special Jury Robert Mueller after a report called Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"" "the panel recorded work in recent weeks," "" "Wall Street Journal" "" "wrote on appeal with the cause trusted in the past few weeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="1482">The newspaper evaluates the step as signs that Mueller have expanded its investigations and intensified.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The CNN transmitter reported that the bodies of the committee had already been associated with a meeting between Trumps eldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Us secret services accuse the Kremlin for prolonged, targeted in the presidential campaign in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examined whether there were referenced between Trumps Controlling team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the focus of investigations, several men are to be involved in the campaign as an advisor to the republicans.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to reports, Mueller also took more and more trumps private and business environment under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="1488">The Washington Post, wrote some weeks ago that the special investigator Trump personally spent personally in the center and supplict the allegations whether the President was disabled by justice in the course of the affair.</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Lawys is to test this evidence in possible fragile accidents and to decide whether Indictment shall be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Therefore Grand Jurys are called also count-chambers.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Mostly they are turned on when it is about larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always closed behind the closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The panel can also be turned on by the Public Prosecutor to address persons under the oath of Eid.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the CNN, pre-invitations were issued to turn around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">Persons who participated in the meeting were asked to a statement to be called in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">In addition, they should provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Apart from Trump Jr. there were also Trumps consultants and son-in-law Jared Kushner as well as his team leader Paul Manafort with the conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Right-wing performers said on Thursday night in the US television that the suspension show that Mueller should not be sober in his work, and that it should be necessary to act quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">But it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be on the end to decide on the survey of an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Nevertheless, the incorporation of the bodies of the beginning of a new phase in investigations and a new reason to concern the concern for President Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the middle of the new unveiling, the President on Thursday evening was given a speech in West Virginia to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.</seg>

<seg id="1505">But they are usually working in the enclosure, he emphasized.</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House advocates all measures that accelerated the work of the special tool on a fair in "fair."</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI boss James Comey has said three times that it would not be determined against the president.</seg>
<seg id="1508">You have no reason to accept that something has changed, it was in the explanation about it.</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller had been used only after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Because of this raspiration, allegations against drump was made according to Trump, he wants to impedient to justice.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Comey said in June of a Senate Committee, Trump asked him to set a setting of the investigations against the national security consultant Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president stands under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>

<seg id="1519">In the West Arctic, a gigantic iceberg has solved by the Schelfeis from the barely 7-fold size of Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="1520">The Alfred Wegvener Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Maritime Research took place on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">The over a trillion tons heavy and 5800 square kilometers large colossoms now drove to the north and will probably take two, three years until it is melted.</seg>
<seg id="1522">It is located at 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers one of the largest iceberg who have registered in the past three decades.</seg>

<seg id="1525">In total, however, there have been a series of unusual collision in the region for around 30 years, the U.S. Research Center for Snow and ice (NSIDC) writes in a fact behind.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, it could be linked to the global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The turbulent Koloss was a part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis floating on the sea and is fed by big glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow into the sea and breaks off regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the top of the antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">At the north of this Schelfeat, the balance of waxes was disturbed and break up some years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete Schelfeis was depressed there, writes AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is a lot to say that the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is in danger, because the front edge has never pulled back as far as at present.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice-top is lower than voltage and could be broken down, if a piece of keys are broken.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg rises not sea level as they swim in water and ice cream as much water, as it happens after the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the ham lead the glaciers directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase the sea level, but only in a low degree, the British research project writes about Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI, the Larsen-C-Schelfeis, with nearly 50 000 square kilometers, is the fourth largest lake of Antarctica.</seg>
<seg id="1539">On the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, on the front edge to the free ocean approx. 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks off regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"" "" "" "although it is a natural event and does not require direct connection to climate change, the ice sign is now in a endangered position," "" "said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University." ""</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "this is the most far retreat since the beginning of records" "" "he also confirmed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">Under scientists may be controversial whether the Larsen-C-Schelfeis returned, and possibly merge together, his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this trend will last decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even if these researchers have not lead the breakdown of this gigantic ice rash to climate change, however, many ice caves of Antarctic Peninsula have fallen into the past decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long watch of Antarctica extends towards South America.</seg>

<seg id="1797">The lavender is reminded of the recess of drought, and because of the diseases of the insects, scientists and farmers, trying to find solutions, are prepared to find solutions, large headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert in the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the Lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant was exposed to the effects of climate change, which brought much less rain in the spring and much more.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has impact on the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a small cicade, a micro bacterium, transfers the dwarf, and with very dry weather there are many of them. "</seg>

<seg id="1804">So we have less parts with essential oil. "</seg>
<seg id="1805">The solutions that are considered to be considered, belong to a better water distribution and the slowdown of evaporation from the ground, but also the removal of plants with a protective mixture of sound and water and the development of varieties that are resistant to dry resistance.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist emphasises the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The employees of weekly Riodoce meet usually on Wednesdays to check their plans for reporting the most recent chaos within the State of Sinaloa with the organized crime, corted civil servants and incessory drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of her own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists will discuss the safer: they are supposed to take their children with the office, which were the aim of an attack with grenades, or to leave her home in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words to a table on the front of the room: opponent, neutral, ally.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for every column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and abdominal sensation.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug adversaries, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected to stand on the salaries of the government or the cartels, a catalog of criminals which make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There are no rest of violence, and during the whole country the corpses are frequent, there are more journalists: at least 25, since president Enrique Pena Nieto has stepped up in December 2012. 589 are having regard to attacks and threats in the federal government and until now there were at least seven dead in seven countries.</seg>
<seg id="1818">The latter is editor and their inspiration of Riodoce, the co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and journalist," "" "Valdez wrote in one of his many books on violence in connection with drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">It's lack of absence, although its presence is present - a big photo by Valdez, showing his mid-finger with the word "Justice". two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, carry T-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop will take place less than two months after his death, and the reporter discuss their shared topics, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a special edition of the Federal Ministry of Public Affairs was established in 2010 to work the cases of journalists, according to the Committee for the protection of journalists only two penalties.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with the most thousands of Morning who are associated with drug trafficking and organisational crimes, the murderers of journalists will only rarely be tried in court.</seg>
<seg id="1824">In Riodoce, they still exist to treat power from sinaloa, although they are intoxicuous, although the terrain is even more avenge now.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meetings on safety has little benefits, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to turn my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we know why we know all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of May 15 Valdez left the Office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was forced by two men. he was forced to move on him for 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper - who is translated into a twelfth river.</seg>
<seg id="1830">The rest drove off in his car and damaged it in the vicinity.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But the topic Valdez there is practically nothing in silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest in January and the extradition of the United States in January, Sinaloa became one of the most bloody battlements of the country, since rival factions have been fighting here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day or several people on the streets are shot or that the graveyard is full of enchants, two-story moleen for drug users who are larger than many houses for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Remember for a minute that there is a state of peace "there, if only a Kartell has control over the coastal state with its valuable harbors and drugs trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the hazards of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is destroyed by the fault that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstanding have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First, in February, the publication of a interviews with Damo Lopez, a leader of the rivalled cartel fractions in war with Guzmans's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This release may be annoying the sons, suspected of each copy of the issue, as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kioske.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second fault was to force Valdez for this purpose, according to the confiscation of another newspaper that had published the same story to leave the country at its own security.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had so long survived that his friends and colleagues annimitate that he would be always there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He was active in 2003 as an experienced reporter for Noroeste, when he joined Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars in holdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to operate journalism without any problem," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1847">The newspaper underwent a call for the courageous and honourable coverage, and the sales and advertisements received.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved it to publish hard treats without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody would be dared to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the foundation of Riodoce she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors Cabot Award" for their coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of journalists in the persecution of Mexican Drugs history, where he also led them.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave himself up that he had fear.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"" "" "" "I would like to continue to live," "" "he said at the time of the CPJ." ""</seg>
<seg id="1853">Drug trade in Sinaloa, "is a way of life," he said in October, in an interview with Rompeviento-TV.</seg>
<seg id="1854">"you need to take the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you are playing the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">"" "I don't want to be asked:" "" "what have you done? why did you not say what was going before?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun bird, who was able to curse the friend who was generously with hugs and counties, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted at his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always bear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always be to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, go there on the same table there.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love for routine in destruction?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death has also been forced to ask her own interests in question how they can do their work on the best thing and to stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"" "" "" "they don't like to move with their wives, their children, their clean shops, home and runways" "" "to move drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-self-self-self-maintenance.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own installer.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells wrong, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The trouble is, said the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal that, "smell a sense that can be mocked... and then the thing with Javier happens."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, such as he and others say, apply in Sinaloa, just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a toxic mixture of lucrative smuges, weak institutions and corrupt government officials.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the employees met by Riodoce for security training, suddenly there were no mobile phones. days earlier, Spyware, who sells exclusively to governments to monitor the surveillance of journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen sought refuge in front of the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of an tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a middle-class quarter of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in Purgites, some of the reporters asked whether they belong to the 50 percent of the policemen who own Governor himself as not trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months ago, since the reporter have gone into the mountain landscape where the drug lists de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Riodoce has shot on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">It was the assassination of the brother's brother Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the state spending that focused on the hometown of the governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group that in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor, led a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about it, who was abducted or as it was, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite local drug addiction and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public notes that the restaurant was registered under the name of a policy which ruled the regent Institutional Revolution Party (pri) which ruled nearly the whole century all political levels.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several pri governors were accused of corruption of high-calibre corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">"" "Villarreal asked the reporter to write over previous incidents in this local, including one in which a son of" "" "El Chapo" "" "was deferred by a military attack." ""</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months ago the readers of Valdez had informed the column of Valdez as the best informed source of abduction.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"" "" "" "earlier we had known what happened," "" "said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname" "" "El FLACO" "" "because of its slim body composition." ""</seg>
<seg id="1885">"all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">The Valdez office was dedicated to the storage room for signs and stickers, dedicated to the Morde of journalists, because the employees have become something that they never expected it: activist in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez-snapped a few signs and passed the next morning to a demonstration for another journalist for the Office of the Prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed, in the western federal state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burned body has been discovered and civil servants have been discovered, based on DNA testing that it is his.</seg>
<seg id="1890">In the whole country, journalists became stronger, having written in organized protests, "SOS Press" on obedience and buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1891">On that day, director Bojorquez is gone in Washington and tries to gather international support for justice in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">During a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to expressing journalists and to kill them because they said the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has been asked since then to be divided by the government, because it is concerned that her rage has violated their objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico of organizational crimes committed by government officials and a valid society. "</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book "Narco-Journalism," he wrote that reporter cannot only be killed by drug, but also at the command of politics and security forces that put a organized crime under a ceiling.</seg>

<seg id="1898">Obviously the murders have a terrible effect.</seg>
<seg id="1899">No one will forget the death of the blogrief Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border of Tamaulipas at six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Her body was found along with a note that was allegedly signed by the Zetas de Kartell: "here I am for my reports."</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and earphones in addition to their separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some branches have chosen to close the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state Chihuahua after the assassination of the Mirosihlava Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue to do like El Manana of Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of its Director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed to the drug cartels with a guiding article on the front page with the heading "What do you want from us?"</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists went out of their home country or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">It's hard to find work in exile, and still watch the streets and seek for dangers.</seg>
<seg id="1908">And sometimes they are chased, as evidently the photographer Ruben Espinosa who, in 2015, together with four women in a dwelling in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz.</seg>

<seg id="1924">Now, researchers found that the first findings of the incredible rhinorns of a Canadian miners were so well preserved that experts were described as "Mona Lisa the Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1925">It was so good that they could even determine that his shoe skin was of reddish Braun - and they said that she had something of a "unknown past."</seg>
<seg id="1926">The report in the journal "Current Biology" called him as "the beaded dinosaurs Dinosaurs, who was ever found, and one of the best dinosaurs copies of the world."</seg>
<seg id="1927">The fossil is a newly discovered kind of Nodosaurier who lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1928">His incredibly well preserved condition has researchers that it is considered "really remarkable."</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic, the mored plant carnivores is the best preserved Fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn Funk, when he was born on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, dug.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He met somewhat, what seemed to the surrounding rock in the place, and decided to look at a look.</seg>
<seg id="1932">Discovered by him Fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years to cover the wild beast inside the 2,500 pound (1,100 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all these hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"" "" "" "if you only blind a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that it hatched" "" "said the main autor Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen." ""</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will enter the science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs copies - Mona Lisa the dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers found that this plant-carnivores, although it is covered with a armor, and a changing tank, probably from carnivorous dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The strong dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide themselves in front of prey, and used a parachute technology that is known as counteract, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have been allowed to mix well into its surroundings and prevent his enemies, experts predict that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature of the Nodosaurier family has made headlines in May and is now at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal, and it is called Borealopelta markmitchelli after the Museumstechniker Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7.000 hours to cover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing conservation of specimen enabled the Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the patterns and the form of sheds and arms over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the confession, a widespread defense method in animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than their underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although it is common, the results are surprising because the size of Borealopelta exceeds that of the living animals today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaurs has chased sufficient pressure through the carnivorous dinosaurs, making evolution of the confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals that use the pastures - think of Rehe, Zebras or Gird themselves - are much smaller and violently than prey, which was signalled that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predatory behaviour on a massive, strong white dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaurs pirates have to have been the cradecent of the Cretaceous period," said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1948">Chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaurs was rotted.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to investigate the animal on advises about his life, including its preserved vintent to figure out what it has eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaurs, when he died, fell into a river and pushed into the sea, where he sank on the back of the sea.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time Alberta were as warm as South-florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much more landward than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">This Nodosaurier is really remarkable because he is covered fully with contemptless skin, but also in three dimensions it remains and the original form of the beast 'retains, "said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1953">"the result is that the animal is almost exactly like in the early delivery time.</seg>
<seg id="1954">You don't need to use fantasy to reconstruct it. if you only have a little with your eyes, you might believe that he is in sleep. "</seg>
<seg id="1955">The Cretaceous was a time when huge theropoden, carnivorous dinosaur, who stood on two legs, crossed the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions years after Borealopelta, the paneled Dinosaurs was chased by some of his furious ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 feet (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, their latest findings in the journal Current Biology appear, believe that Borealopelta have been reconciled after death in the sea and in mud mumified.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was born on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, dug.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the hammered dinosaurs of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle until the hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1.300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips developed by his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the paneled plant carnivores was damaged through the western Canada until the flooded river was flooded into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater operation of the dinosaurs kept his armour in fine item detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The remnants of this special specimen are so good that the skin is still going to cover the holyrings along the dinosauriers.</seg>
<seg id="1966">Like Michael Greshko for National Geographic, it is such a level of conservation so 'rare like a profit in lotto numbers.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The more I see it, the more confused it.</seg>

<seg id="2019">How a activist came to learn the answer to the question: "whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014 Brittany Ferrell was shaken by her core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Just one day after they arrived in New York City, sitting in St. Louis prayers on the bed of an Airbnb-apartment that they rented and scroll through Facebook on their phone.</seg>
<seg id="2022">They are proud of a post by someone from the High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"" "" "" "the police have killed an 18 year old child, and there is still on the street," "" "she was there." ""</seg>
<seg id="2024">Confusing, since no one had posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the manual @ TheePharoah has been constantly prayed to their timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The rapper from the area of St. Louis was thereby the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed by a white police in Ferguson, Mo., was killed live.</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Browns leblosem body that was out on the road and would remain there four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"" "" "" "this is wild," "" "Ferrell" "" "was" ""</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was not new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">You laid their mobile phone to return later on the evening of Tweets over people on the Canfield-Drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There were photos of police band and people, crying, and from a man who claimed to be a sign with the inscription: "Fergusons Police has just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">She observed a live feed, which is a policeman in front of a group of demonstrators with a banning dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"" "in another video, she said," "" "assured another policeman is his defense and cried," "" "I will all kill you..." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not common," that Ferrell is reminded of their statement.</seg>
<seg id="2035">"this is not the kind of murder that we are accustomed to us and which we can see."</seg>
<seg id="2036">At this moment I felt contemaking.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">You buked a return flight and went home next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After the landing at 23 o'clock, she repeated her 6-year-old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two on the next morning would go to Ferguson.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary movie, "Whose Streets?" in the cinemas from 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a history of survival and Protestants, love and destruction, strength and resistance, which consists of the sight of people who live in the community and filled the streets to ask answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">When Ferrell, with her daughter, wore a flower-dress and a suitable crown, brought the two a conversation, which they had countless times in front of this morning "over the black experience and black condition."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"" "" "" "you remembered not how I taught you when black people have to fight for those who want to believe?" "" "they remembered what she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2044">"" "" "" "now we go to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, and that was not right." ""</seg>
<seg id="2045">I didn't take it away, "Ferrell said."</seg>
<seg id="2046">"what happens today is a high point of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It has to know, and it must see and be moved in.</seg>
<seg id="2048">It must be well developed, not only activism and organization but also the various layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free to liberate ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even though I have lucky enough to give her a experience in which they don't experience any supernatural racism, it is no other than the next black women child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">I have the feeling I would give her a bad service to keep it far away. "</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first stop when they arrived in Ferguson at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which became a camp site, when the activists were waiting for the possible non-indictment by Officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">In Ferrell and her daughter have joined a local company for lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags, and halve them on demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly I began to accept a new type of activism for Ferrell shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed after 9 August," said it and notices that she was as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority student NCourse Association and focused on essence of justice and health inequalities in black communities.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It has come all. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">He later met Ferrell during an evening demonstration on Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said, she and her cinematographer Lucas Alvarado Farrar didn't want to document, "what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">"" "a question was Ferrell in the sense:" "" "want to document or attempt to find a story that you can use it?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2061">This skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often of white, in a community that benefited from their pain and their resistance to their resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">Just as Folayan declared in an interview: "we had heard that people who were born in Ferguson and grew up and raised their voices, and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had already worked together with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area that is known for his activism around death.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His commitment brought the project closer, together with six other natives the team followed by "Whose Streets?" in the years after browns.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or with us. we speak," said Davis.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"" "" "" "that was the main thing for me how these people are represented, for so I will be represented." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2067">The target was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that it is not a Messiah leaders, but for a community that came together, "said Folayan - she proved to be the most obvious number of participants in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">In follicing, showing documents by "Whose Streets?" surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrells Life as she loves and marries her wife.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "but I understood that there must be certain injuries in this work and in the absence of black people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrell's history repeats the role of the black gay women in the wider Black Lives movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement that followed the film "BlacklivesMatter" in the social media in 2012, identify themselves as a gay.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Black, pregnant women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether, "said Ferrell," and therefore we are struggling with different fronts.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Black, schwule women must bear the main load of everything. "</seg>
<seg id="2075">Folayan voted to remember that "the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"" "however, it insisted that" "" "this is not a significant type of action," "" "when Ferrell was chosen as heart of the film" "" "because of its identity." ""</seg>
<seg id="2077">"" "" "" "she was the person who shakened this energy," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2078">"" "" "" "it is no coincidence, although she was at the front front, because in a life of these crucifixings than a black, weakens woman as much on the game." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">Meanwhile, the news conference in Ferguson has recently disappeared, but the racial connections between the congregation and the police continue.</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on parole for 2 ½ years because of the blocking of a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the social atmosphere of the area that calls her home ":" an chaos. "</seg>
<seg id="2083">Nevertheless, she doesn't wait for a singing and she feels to this memory, since she went on to the road three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"it is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>

<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "size wahn": TV readers discuss about Bit gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves the people, although it is not yet built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre on the southern edge of the pedestrian area moved to the people in Being worries and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">Cold lets the topic hardly any one.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg" on our Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="2093">While recording a bit gallery: "this would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "This would be really class" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "needs no man" (Siggi Baking) or completely: "size wahn!" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While the advocate building plans to attract more customers into the city, the others also benefit from other shops, the adversary also fear the pedestrian zone.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the property, on which the peasant market hall stands in which 13 directors are marketed their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">It will conclude with the start of the construction work.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The Gallery Macher want to integrate a market hall in the new building - and for Beda Square with possibility of sitting outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Rooms: "we've been able to buy almost weekly in the farm hall for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cake of the agriculture always gladly.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Also the butcher we have discovered for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like to wish that even during and above all, after the building of the gallery, a chance to maintain this promotion.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other towns, there is too.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "if you are marketed in a market hall in the gallery, arrives at the height of the rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The new project does not have to be too low with the new project. "</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "why shopping arvest in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">Whether clothing, shoes, drogeries or supermarkets: I find the superfluous.</seg>
<seg id="2108">There are already enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You can see how many stores are empty here - some since months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But since there is not even a regular weekend market, it is more important for us to receive at least the market hall.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Because after all, the goods offered there is fresh, mainly the product is offered directly from the product, and is very low priced.</seg>
<seg id="2112">How to see, shop transactions are rented in a shopping center only from larger companies, because the rental rentals are often not portable.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Too bad, special business is almost no longer and that which is still left, will probably disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Trafficking: "a shopping center with a Markthalle is not fit for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all: where should the peasant market hall at building time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old EDECA would be the solution - even on duration when the bit gallery is really coming.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does it make the ghostest bit gallery already before to distribute all shops from Bitburg? "</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "that's not going to work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">And shopping center, which is empty, does not need any man.</seg>
<seg id="2121">From my view it would have been better to promote a real estate market, instead of this gallery.</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a peasant market hall, it is possible thanks to the mad many - how I find - senseless construction projects in Bitburg no more.</seg>
<seg id="2123">When the peasant hall is broken, a piece of culture will disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2124">A right similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are visible - white, black and brown that are almost inattentive to the walls of the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg made of Wangen-TupX and Haarmann, which were sent to Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent out the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former secret service analysis in a 35-year sentence served as secret diplomacy on the website of WikiLeaks.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition that was opened on August 2, is A Becoming Resemblance (A matching similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline was converted to their expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a trans and pioneering dissidy whose condemnation was converted by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithm analysis of DNA, which could be extracted from thirty portraits, such as someone can interpret with these genomic data - the many ways to interpret it and inherent the inherent determinants of these interpretations - but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born in Bradley Edward, but already since its puberty on the identification as a woman, was convicted in 2013 because of 20 accusations, including six violations of the spying law, computer, and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">The prison was suppressed, so much that there was only one single photo - a grab, black-white selfie, in which maning sits clearly on a driver seat and a platinblonde is wearing - she was associated with it.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came straight from the great success of its 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">The artist Portraits have produced from a stranger from forenic arteas like cigar blunt and chewing gum by removing the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of it as these people could look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they led an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted to accompany a sort of portrait to this product," explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she couldn't be visited at that time and could not be photographed, so that you took contact with Chelsea, and asked them whether they wanted a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated Muse were bound to unlock Brieffreds, who exchanged several letters during the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">She even called one of Shoili Kanungo illustrated comic "Supplied Images" which would be a future predicted in which the President chorus would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama actually became only a few days after the book was released, Mannings would ask for seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome sort of happy resources.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also now at the opening of the exhibition "Starke and Starkes, since Donald Trump leads an war against informant from the government camp and against Transgender-forces to recover new, tweeter ways, which it should actually resolve to escape.</seg>
<seg id="2142">As Dewey-Hagborg after a strange timing of all these things, she said that "things were going through a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In one on the wall of the gallery the artistic statement called for Manning with their oversized signature (the "i" in their family name is provided with a heart) an end of the "automatic ceremonies, whose basis, gender, race, sexuality and culture have been."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall, its mitochondrial DNA sequence is a thousandler of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show how the inclusion of 200 letters (or nucleotide according to the highly developed scientific Lexicon of the artist) show how amazing, at least in biological terms, we all are.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"" "" "" "what people are hopefully to take away, who we are, and how are the genetic data for a interpretation and how subjective they are," "" "said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video factory of 2007, are also to be seen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell as many different stories, therefore the 30 of these stories."</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition which is kept in a own room is one page from the mentioned comic Novelle mentioned above.</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning, as they appear in the hands of the United States of the United States as King-Kong.</seg>

<seg id="2211">"you have now tools such as Strava and Fitbit for the persecution of their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics system is used by companies to measure collaborating staff.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said that she had a better viewing in what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the snap-polls and surveys of certain teams, it offers a heat map of the company which indicates that units have most complaints and which executives should have low condition - so that you can redrill, why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies come to see that at the top of workplace culture, so that you have not been involved in the next Uber, which has been involved in Skandals since then a former employee has published a blog-mail, which describes a environment of harassays, where those who have spoken, have been punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups like Glint, this wish for an overview of a lucative business possibility.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The Global governance, regulation and compliance sector could own more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to the financial technical website let's Talk Payments.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, the company helps to prevent bad behavior and to recognize, saw an increasing interest and activity beginning of this year in the heart of Uber-Falles in Miskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Convercent has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Uber has recently signed as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">How Glint, Convercent company makes customized "Puls-" Surveys to check real time in real time and view the warmth maps of your problem.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline with the coworable behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And if the managing director is included, complaints directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"the Court of public opinion has captured the regators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convercent.</seg>
<seg id="2224">When a company is found that his employee is poorly treated or unethically, it can experience precious consequences by consumers-boycott, workers-fluorktuation and clature, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations, Convercent has deployed to more than one year to ensure that the employees are aware of politics and procedures, and a simple way to achieve their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Previously, if a worker wanted to report a problem, he had to submit an additional number or e-mail to the corporate headquarters, a formal appeal and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often an inexhausting and uncomfortable experience, James Vitrano, Ruby TUESDAYS General Counsel, who said, there was no good opportunity to track the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now, since the company Converters allows issues that have been hidden from executives that were sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unknown practices - quicker and addressed.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"I can closer to these holistic, 360-degree view of experience with employment," said Vitrano, who runs the risk management Group of Ruby Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"and we protect our shareholders in employment of employment."</seg>
<seg id="2231">Companies began studying Ethics, Values, and Employees's commitment in 2002, after the accounting company Arthur Andersen, due to ethical violation through the Enron-Skandal, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2232">"" "but it took until the" "" "social media came to their right" "" "that the company knew that you did not avoid that their dirty clothes went online." ""</seg>
<seg id="2233">"" "" "" "before using technology for monitoring the ethics, people used hope than a strategy," "" "said he." ""</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service, and load the company with recurring fees for use in their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance that will find the approval of Venture Capital investors who have both scheduled start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Convercent received $10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, with which the entire capital raised to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glers secured $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and brought his entire financing to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">This investment is hardly surprising, in view of the connected nature of companies, culture and Venture Capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research that shows that today the staff of today expect more than so far.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets like Silicon Valley are high salaries and interesting projects only.</seg>
<seg id="2241">Employees want to feel the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated that you will spend your time a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"" "" "" "if men are happy to feel to be in a company, and that the work that you will do is worthwhile to make it stronger," "" "said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Quee Experience in LinkedIn which both Convercent as well as Glint is used." ""</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors can reach Rendites when their portfolio company run well. companies are running well, if employees are working and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the analytics-tools need third parties to increase their commitment and commitment to the employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data is important about the employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data are useless if the administrator of a company does not take measures.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, if a company asks people after your feedback, it may have a anticipation that changes on the way is.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change does not come quickly, or at all, this disappointments and employees can carry out.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"" "" "" "if you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you have to have been willing to have 4,000 conversations," "" "said Russell Raath, President of Consulting during Business Management Company Kotter International, which has seen the company too much to collect data." ""</seg>

<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now carries monthly employees now, was able to initiate action on the same day if a problem is reported via Glint, so Errett.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after collecting from frustrated employees, it was able to organize and able to organize several teams in the company's speed and quality of communication, to add multiple teams within the company and to add a communication training to tackle the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">With Ruby Tuesday, the company is getting a new insights on the employees, and it hopes that at a long point of view, this leads to a better binding of workers in a branch which is known for high revenue.</seg>

<seg id="2290">Creating a comic novel: a castle in the history of England</seg>
<seg id="2291">In his younger past the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-s and 1980-s a hole-hole.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history of his comfortable seat in the watering River Valley in Kent and now has been inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaarigen Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.</seg>
<seg id="2293">"I think it was so nice to look at the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says weary.</seg>
<seg id="2294">"what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand."</seg>
<seg id="2295">'A Castle in England 'moves the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documented the families who lived in Scotney. every story was illustrated by Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.</seg>
<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes, which is based on an archive: he wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection which was inspired by documents in the British library - a project which he was unexpectedly found.</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I only responded to the thumb print on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700's, which worked for the Jacobins," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2298">"this is his thumb print!</seg>
<seg id="2299">And letters always smell like smoke, because there was a fire in the light of the light.</seg>
<seg id="2300">For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as it would also be involved.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Oh, I love archives! "</seg>
<seg id="2302">For someone who is defeated so with old papules, it is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England, and nearly four months lived in a castle ("To be honest: I have a little thought") seems to be nice to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days to explore the Victorian "new" castle to explore the archives and study many treasures and curiosities of the castle, like about the mounted hymn of the walls and the bottles, who had spent centuries in the grave.</seg>
<seg id="2304">He emigrated through the premises and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with land care, gardener and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Then, he drank, "Whiskey and began to write."</seg>
<seg id="2306">Scotney's intimate history is relatively unknown, since the National Trust was given the full access in 2006 when the last building, Elizabeth Hussey died.</seg>
<seg id="2307">When Rhodes met a decade later, the employees began to take care of the archives that he spoke as "hundreds of years, in which Aristroguards said" Oh, "it was described in the attic."</seg>
<seg id="2308">Diary, letters from the period of the English Empires, maps, which had what had said: "one could think that country conflicts would be boring boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch to have fought two families.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Guys, let all go his aisle! "</seg>
<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to spread on a wider basis in the English history, among them 'The Labourer', which follows a man built the newly built castle in order to join the farmhouse of 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"" "" "" "there is a record of a riot that occurred in 1380 in the castle, in this book with the title 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," "" "says Rhodes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2312">"" "" "" "the peasant revolted in this field and I thought a revolt was a good start." ""</seg>
<seg id="2313">Perhaps they are interconnected with each other? "</seg>
<seg id="2314">Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest' that was the story of the Jesuit patter, hidden the family of Darrell seven years during the English Reformation.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Or 'The Smugglers' in which the smugglers Arthur Darrell is depicted in the 18th century, he filled his own burial (a discovery which was only made later, when his sarg was dug).</seg>
<seg id="2316">The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family of Scotney: "the gentlemen to be appropriate to be, always return to debts and spend money on things they could not afford.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Other generations of Darrell men solving their debt crises by giving rich women in marriage, I present them to me as a bunch well-looking guys with a talent to promote landlocked. "</seg>
<seg id="2318">After the end of its use in the castle, Rhodes in search of other unique write experiences</seg>
<seg id="2319">He has brought a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elder Poki, the grounds of a sanctuary from the early 20th century, which has been reclaimed by nature.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But Scotney has a special place for him.</seg>

<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it could not be mad in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robot.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robot is currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently published the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for Responsible Robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robot in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus status for robotics and artificial intelligence at the University Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we need to start their ascension.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its form of nipple and the type of fingernagel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"" "" "" "people make them funny, but the companies deliver any amount of it, and we will see them much more common," "" "said Mr. Sharkey at the publication of his new report." ""</seg>

<seg id="2397">The user can also adjust his robot according to his beliefs, "and will select everything, from the eye-colour of the robot through the form of chest warts up to type or colour of its fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it is still worrying, as many robots inherit the "personalities" which would be a stepper woman.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexpo ppen have developed to robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The real Botix Robot allows for example to adjust its robots to the properties that are appealing to the characteristics such as relaping.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is still the Roxxxy Gold sex robot with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah" which gives the impression of relapses and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>

<seg id="2405">It can be tired, fixed to conversation, or it can be "in mood"! "</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many beworrying aspects of this ascent of sex robot - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the understandable female properties that goes to rape, if you go one step towards Frigid (here: resistible) Farrah, troubled one at most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website True Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men do not have Roxxxy?" it is on the site.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robot is not only a fetish or just another sex game.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their birth and their increasing refinement show a slightly darker and deeper understanding of our culture, to a withdrawal from the Ideal of gender equality to a desire after sex with subjugation as an optional allowance.</seg>
<seg id="2411">As of course, most men will receive no sex robot, and while the FRR admits its increasing popularity, they will still remain at the edge of consumer culture.</seg>

<seg id="2413">And many people are not strangely or minded, until they are free for the free market.</seg>

<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robot is to make a physical similarity to real women as realistic as technically possible (if also with Porsche star Proporters).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Her awakens want to feel human being in human being that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>

<seg id="2424">Trumps great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney to overthrow the healthy human lives</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a Binsensible of the Trump era, that the political spcircuits that have polarised with US voters, also families in small format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Harvest in the USA there appeared in the USA's newspapers including discussions about how to interrupt the horror of Trump-relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We stringent us all supposedly to test our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power of Trumps, families.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a left-oriented dichterin, who lives in Chicago and has long been visiting with the republicans in our family, has visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">It reminded me that the unity can have an enemy effect against a common enemy.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, everyone who knows it, including the Republican relationship, with whom she had fought for decades, suddenly and very strange on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">In order to make the dining table it is certainly a good thing, but it falls in another context that this also brings significant risks with it.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The lens was strengthened by trump, but the effective effect of his presidency has power to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">If we speak of "Normalization" and Trump, we refer to the grate possibility that his bibs will not be put up one day.</seg>
<seg id="2436">However, there is still a troubled longtime scenario, in which Trump Republicans of the right wing "normalised" which appears suddenly in comparison to its standards as opposed to its standards.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find myself today from a active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's comic version of the backdrop - the dog on the Autodach, the 14% income tax (but at least, we knew how his tax returns) - both in comparison to Trump in fact rather than very mild criminal offences.</seg>
<seg id="2438">If Trump goes, the next candidate of Republicans must be spiritually healthy in order to qualify for unmeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When I was my cousin in the city, we brought our kids to the Carousel in Central Park, the largest of the Carousel's park department, and the best three dollars that one can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are crisy and the animals are turning to look full of fear of their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate persizing music thus conveys this attention.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city are disappointed: the views of high buildings are old, the Skylines are familiar to provide a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city will not be justified.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Five and thirty years later, and I was not yet all over the day, when I found out that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss Cottage - the Topye Olde Swiss Cottage is not counted - but a large roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">The Central Park Carousel is still a strange magical experience, since two years old, a 11 year old and two women in the 40-s can go on it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">When I had to evaluate the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one has asked about it.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same as plus the option to tip the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the shop table.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This does not only lead to a slowdown of what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also pressure on the server to put personality into a situation, not necessary.</seg>

<seg id="2455">The prosecutors have announced their intention, this time against the six-year sentence of Pistorius Appell who they say that they may be too opaque.</seg>
<seg id="2456">The National Prosecution Authority reported that it would be raised by the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the objection could be heard this year.</seg>

<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can be used for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study asserts exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could shorten the symptoms of patients with anti-inflammatory bowel diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The unreable condition that affects approximately 1.3 million and in Britain 300,000, causes gastropes and bleeding, recurring or blueprints, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While those affected are normally advised, meat and dairy products found that researchers found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins, to develop a tolerant intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, stated that immune cells in the intestinal patrol to ensure that harmful microbes to hide themselves in the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are able to resolve inflammation, are balanced by cells that promote the tolerance and protect the body without sensitive tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance is in the direction of inflammation, it has resulted in a inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments it was determined that a type of tolerance is necessary for mice that use a particular bacterium in their innards.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the blocks of proteins - to resolve the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterias - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbioma and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more had they of these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">It proposed that the combination of L. reuteri and a tryptophan rich diet would be tolerable, less inflammatory colosus, if the same system is effective in humans.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The post-doctoral studies Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan searched a kind of immune cell who invented the tolerance when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the tribe that had been stopped, this had not had.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It believes that the difference with intestinal microbiomes of mice had to do - the communion of bacteria, viruses and fungus that usually live on the stomach intestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The mice of mice were found DNA sequenced, and there were six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells, but without them missing in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were taken up in a sterile environment, so that they lacked a intestinal microbioma and they were not developed this kind of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria stimulated the immune system, researchers investigated L. reuteri in a liquid and then overled small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells, which were isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerant-carrying cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component of the liquid has been cleaned, it proved itself as a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism that is known as Indol-3-lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers have doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of these cells increased by about 50 percent, but if tryptophonic values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan said that people have the same tolerant-promoting cells such as mice, and that most of us L. reuteri protect our stomach-gut traversing.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether Tryptophan side products from L. reuteri will develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in humans with anti-inflammatory illness.</seg>
<seg id="2602">She said: "the development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote, since these cells controls inflammations on the inside surface of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially, high tryptophonic values might result in the presence of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2863">Has the PSG Barcelona been warned about three years ago?</seg>
<seg id="2864">The site of La League likes her interest to Marco Verratti</seg>
<seg id="2865">Paris Saint-Germain will not release in their persecution by Neymar, after having issued an offer of £189 million, but have been warned of Barcelona prior years prior to the world record?</seg>
<seg id="2866">The sensational approach has the transfer window in summer, because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than the double of the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United last season.</seg>
<seg id="2867">After the completion, Neymar is the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional sportsmen in the world. PSG offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week.</seg>
<seg id="2868">Barcelona is wager over the way, as Neymar has moved his way to the outside, although a source near the Catalans Management Board insisted that the club has always been his best to worry about it from Santos in 2013 to take care of him.</seg>
<seg id="2869">But was the football world began three years ago from the PSG President in front of this view?</seg>
<seg id="2870">As Manchester City 2014 admitted to the signature of Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for any organisation, who wanted to sign up one of the best players from PSG.</seg>
<seg id="2871">"I am not concerned, knowing that if they touch one of our players, we will contact opposition to them, we will contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.</seg>
<seg id="2872">"we respect all Clubs.</seg>
<seg id="2873">"" "" "" "but if they try to sign up one of our players, then this will have consequences." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2874">Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line, with the Spanish society at the beginning of this summer interest in the PSG midfielder Marco Verratti express.</seg>
<seg id="2875">PSG clearly explained that they would not allow it to leave the International from Italy, in some circumstances, and Barcelona was able to feel the consequences of this process by losing their price for Neymar.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen report approves pope-brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen report to the missiles relieved Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This is the author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the misuse parandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen plant will continue for discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Belts, spokesman of the reform movement, "We are Church," declared a publication from the former Regensburger Bishop and today, Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of Pope Benedict XVI.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the view of the Catholic Church, if Müller and Ratzinger would have their deepest regret about their own submissions or their inconstricting assessment of operations.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "" "" "the Vatican" "" "Osservatore Romano" "" "on the other hand, criticized that in coverage over violence against the Domspatzen station with" "" "two" "" "measure" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">In regard to the offences in Regensburg, no one knows that it would have to stick to "shly and corrupt deeds" until the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics Committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the Anhability, the Catholic Church as a source of all evil, is already part of everyday experience and prepared for the public opinion that" "" "writes Scaraffia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">Also the Principality of Thurn and Taxis said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: "we are happy to go on to the church and this is a carved frescoes."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "in addition, she pointed out that in their adolescence" "" "a completely normal educational means" "", "to work with children, as I was one was ready to be ready." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">They are unfair, today set standards for earlier decades, because the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with reports about the missiles, pope-brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Fully unexpectedly, the author and historian Michael Hesemann, who translated with Ratzinger the reminder "My brother of the Pope" (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection," "" "says Eemann," "" "for all this had nothing to do with him," "" "he evaluates the results of the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report written by the diocese of Regensburg with the Enlightenment attorney Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 Regensburger Domagoatzen were victims between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s, with a high sensitivity "victims of overtaking, 67 cathedral sparrows are sexually abused.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report, it says to Georg Ratzinger, who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "briefly, that of Domkapellmeister R. has been applied in many cases of physical and psychic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">At high quality, the punishment for the pupils could also fall more intense.</seg>
<seg id="2907">In contrast to many other accused, many victims were estimated that many victims are estimating the general crime of R., and therefore, in numerous cases, some cases have even positive memories with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In an interview, Eemann, why the final report on the abuse of abuse during the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger declared his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report about the "incidents of failure to failure at the Regensburger Domspatzen" gives a contradictory image by Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">For one lifting many students his "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, it appears as a cholker and perfectionist that the Öfteren could be handy when a cathedral kit had no top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How are you better than his biographer of this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you read the trouble and read all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back, one has to ask if the name Georg Ratzinger is at all in it.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Only eight pages dedicated to him and it is clear from any suspicion of the media- or wiper in the horrible cases sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Also the nonviolence at the preschool took place outside of its effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="2916">You can submit it to him, of it too late or have not taken its first clearances.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The Domspatzymnasium, in which he worked, was taught by practically all those surveyed als - "salvation," heaven "and" better world. "</seg>
<seg id="2918">It portrays the vast majority of his student Georg Ratzinger, a very excellent testimony, describes it as "warm", "well," a competent teacher, who provided the guys regularly with cake, biscusen and bonbons and were "always surrounded by grapes from children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Merely a minority is worth knowing about his perfectionism and its high quality motivating that led to wutout even sometimes.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he didn't only threw himself with chairs, and threw the keyring on the ground, but also for frying guys to the hair or ears, he has already been abandoned even years ago, being deeply regretted and apologized for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">However, in its honour of honour, however, such corrective methods in the fragile time, the 1960s and 1970s, were widely used, with parents as in teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such a choral methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think each of us was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also have experienced that yet in a world-wide school, a state grammar school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what actually happened in this report, namely the deformative sexual abuse and the violence at the preschool, we are happy.</seg>
<seg id="2926">There is one wonder if it doesn't have to do with his acquaintness and his role as brother of Benedict XVI, that many media fell on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">At the Bavarian Pope, yes, many who have never understood it, still alumble.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">The media was reported in connection with the report much about abuse during the Regensburger Domspatzen station.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger in the final report also any consideration or knowledge of sexual abuse within sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: quite clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of 67 victims of sexual violence claims to have committed himself to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never got me to speak with my father or my mother," "" "said," "" "said," "" "I said," "" "It was all very embarrassing for me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in the Enlightenment of sexual abuse was and is that most victims were silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they trusted not even parents and siblings, they definitely did not make a choral manager who had been working for a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do I rate the Domspatzen student Ratzinger's role in terms of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questioned student formulated this way: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case, in which he would have been counting (Georg Ratzinger) and could have stopped the respective perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I hold it... also for really absurd, to assume that it was counting... Buben intruding or more clearer, than against their parents, internatsals, Confidence Teaching etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">Thus, the report says to the very clear result: "that in the preparation of the affected students and / or their environment, could not be confirmed in the context of the study."</seg>
<seg id="2942">As sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is therefore accessible by every participant.</seg>
<seg id="2943">So it can't be cast out, not prevented him or have brought him to the ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore, there is no reason to bring his good name with these conflicting crimes, as unfortunately happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media there was a lot of "nonviolence" at the Regensburger Domspatzen station.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Georg Ratzinger's former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger will be presented in the report.</seg>
<seg id="2947">Do he have to live with this allegations?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that in coverage all miss and menmentia for a giant melange from sexual abuse and nonviolence and somewhere, in the middle of the Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But that's exactly what is a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Since it is clean separately: between the school and the gymnasium, between sexual abuse and nonviolence, we say once, rest.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report deals from the time since 1945, thus from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not chorus master of the Domspatzen station.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole horrible test pedagogy, the cases where boys of sadistic teachers were controlled and painted, were all performed on the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandal states have to rule.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with whom he had nothing to do with them, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys only at the Domspatzymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">It was on the same as the very most witnesses, the theme of "Preschool" taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to escape all of you and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "parawe" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the Domspatzymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: because there was discipline in discipline, but no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, where the report was to conclude that "many victims are estimating the general crime of R. estimations and therefore, in numerous cases, despite violence even positive memories of it."</seg>
<seg id="2959">At the most, the charges still remains to have been carried away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report was able to define only two periods in which it was reported by the state in the school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish itself and from their predecessors at a school that he had not worked and responsible for himself (as the witness) did not want to hear, and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Shut down Georg Ratzinger ahead of the states consistently the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989, he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzymnasium, which even reproduced the report.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this regard he reminds us that" "" "he will continue to be practised in the preschool." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">Already in face of the risk of negative prescription.</seg>
<seg id="2966">It was, of course, at that time, as legal clarity, were banned as a test repenalties in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before, they took place in a legal gray zone, as everyone knows of us.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was also difficult for him to estimate that the person concerned may exaggerated or dragised, where truly the allowable border was exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But it can't say, he would have gone aside.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That is not right.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the test penalty was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The Principality of Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it is unfair to use today's educational standards at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we're talking about the "Falluck of Anachronism" so the danger that is past to vote in today's moral standards.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess has quite right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this is not true for sexual abuse, which was abouched at all times, and not for what was broken down in preschool and violence against innocent children's rimps, that goes far beyond that.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all horrible and I'm glad that it is finally working.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection, for all that had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means to discipline and Punishment, i.e. earchers and ears to draw, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment is then forbidden, he has also kept stricken in it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Which photo of his Regensburger is Georg Ratzinger, for talks with you for the book "My brother of the Pope"?</seg>
<seg id="2982">Came the subject of testing subject to language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, tells of his perspective, as the Domspatzen station played only one part.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I did not utterly abolish that he was a thorough regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But this also has to be said: without these perfectionism, without creating unconditional discipline, it would probably hardly be possible to form a real cultural ambassador in Europe and his musical tradition, which went straight to the US twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With Keksen and Bonbons alone, one makes no big singer once again and before each success, equal to what area, but always discipline, passion and self-invigning.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of man did you experience Georg Ratzinger during the talks about their book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: I learned about the work on the book and in addition I have experienced Georg Ratzinger really quite well and always experienced again as wonderful, humorous, basic, deep faith and heart-good people, of whom you could not imagine that he could do something wrong with a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly get back to him, as many former Domspatzen plant still today, 23 years after his Emergence, regularly visit him - he is almost blind - and him will treat him as a member of their family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who have not given him until today that he was once a strictly part of them, thus clearly are in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Domagodas are thankful to him today that he enriches their lives and to them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, vaulted teacher - a stringent father, certainly that may be - but also a lovable Respect, to which she still watch to see today and honour her.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And, at once again: everything that you should pre-cast into him are corrective methods that were at the time of the agenda.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have already taken this time from time to time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly unjust, a man, just because he is prominently and has a more prominent brother to make a medicine of sin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is evil intention, just behind it, only too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Because the report that was just released, relieve him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the Andrier command would have acquired a 93-year-old man who had acquired great merits and without leaving outside of Bavaria and perhaps in Germany nobody would probably know the Regensky Domspatzen station, finally in peace.</seg>
