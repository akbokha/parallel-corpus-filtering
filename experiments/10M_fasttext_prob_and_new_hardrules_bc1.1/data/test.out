gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the pil@@ es of pil@@ es
his experiences on the horse are over@@ looked .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger looking with some colleagues a little variation with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sports pile &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after some minutes the horses remembered her opening night , they pursued the food business in the fast g@@ opp back home .
one kilometer at this temp@@ o , I was afraid .
&quot; it was no good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and that the riding career ended with him again .
on Saturday , Germany was the best gol@@ fer of all time - 101 tournament victories - again near horses .
he left himself with his family over the plant of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he didn &apos;t swear to photo@@ co@@ cks .
he was the first time in Aachen and thus at the CH@@ IO .
the reason was absolutely convincing .
the German sports assistance provided the man from An@@ hausen in the frame of a small Gala to the Golden Sport@@ pil@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; awards lack the lik@@ able athl@@ ete . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Federal Cross Cross , Silver Lor@@ be@@ er@@ blatt , Champions Tour player of the year ...
even the British Queen has already ad@@ mis@@ ed him .
long is the 18th prize winner of the pyramid of pil@@ es .
in Aachen , he met Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday the first prize winner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this distinction means a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for they won &apos;t only be awarded to sporty commitment , but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since decades , Lan@@ ger has been fo@@ ster the offspring .
and so , he also gave the prize money of EUR 25,000 .
with 15 other outstanding sport@@ s@@ men , the two @-@ fold US master@@ y winner was induc@@ ted into the &quot; Hall of Fame of German Sports . &quot;
for the public@@ ans the athletes Hart@@ wig G@@ ien@@ ger , who Turner Eber@@ hard G@@ ien@@ ger , who Peter Pus@@ ch and Ar@@ nd Schm@@ itt , the Ru@@ wers Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , who , the Ru@@ ins Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Spr@@ dos@@ ites Al@@ win Sho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ ously ad@@ mi@@ red the hand of trade at the hand of Ludwig Erhard .
many of these sports parties came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the lively company emigrated to the Spring@@ st@@ adion , where the Lav@@ az@@ za price ran .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger maintained its distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ t and Tr@@ um@@ ps economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
in infrastructure , the trade agreement is to invest and the trade agreement T@@ TP - that want both Clinton as well as Tr@@ ump .
however , the two US presidential competitors are however , however , in case of tax and energy policy , as well as in a fundamental question .
differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a basic and more philosoph@@ ical difference .
der , about the role of the state .
Tr@@ ump wants to keep in doubt rather small and war@@ ns about how the state of the economy may harm - with tax and regul@@ ators .
Clinton had to handle the economy and regul@@ ate the economy , he says .
he himself would be different , asser@@ ts pot@@ ump .
he will go down reg@@ att@@ ing massi@@ f , and he makes himself strong tax reform with lower tax rates strongly - for individuals and businesses .
Clinton said : the state has appointed certain tasks to open , he has to open the dis@@ advant@@ age@@ ous chances and needs money .
that is why the tax would be increased to the rich , she says .
Inter@@ est@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure .
it must be invested in the must say Tr@@ ump and Clinton almost equal .
the democratic applicants in 2012 announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in infrastructure are the classic democratic politics and are rejected by the national@@ ist Te@@ ach@@ y Wing of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
thus , on Tr@@ ump , we could still be part@@ ed on internal discussions .
clear@@ ances are the differences in the energy and climate policies .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal plants and res@@ ili@@ ze coal extraction in the US again .
there is also possible to termin@@ ate the oil extraction in so far as possible in the Parisian Climate Agreement .
with its investment program , Clinton wants to extend the renewable energies with its investment program : &quot; one country will create the super@@ structure of clean energies and create million jobs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want to be there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - also at international trade agreements the two competitors are not far from each other .
T@@ PP , the state @-@ fish trade agreements , do not want to sign .
but at the same time both do not want to isol@@ ate the United States by international trade - but just better protection against American jobs .
they are then to be paid better , calls about Clinton .
the current minimum wage of 7,@@ 25 US dollars is a star@@ vation wages .
it wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tr@@ ump to do this question is not quite clear : once , he says : the minimum wage must be r@@ ont , then he says he will not be changed .
but the great discussion of the coming months is likely to develop well around the control policy of the two camps .
on one side stands Tr@@ ump , who wants to rein@@ force the economy and citizens to boost growth .
his critics hold on him , that the budget deficit would only be bigger .
on the other hand , Clinton &apos;s at least stands that they want to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution .
escape : &quot; each woman &apos;s wife has experience with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone , almost already for everyday life .
if they come to Germany , they often have trau@@ mat@@ ised .
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen , four women are sitting .
each has a baby , which is a year old at the most .
one has put her little son in the arm .
he gu@@ ards with big eyes curious in the room .
his mother rigid onto the table top .
until they notice that it is observed .
they sm@@ iling and k@@ is@@ ses the little ones .
the scene works normal .
until you &apos;re talking with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is the division of Managing Director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social aid services in Bavaria , and deals with the subject of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are poultry .
they live in Munich north in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alised women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs made up the establishment together with Pro Familia and Munich &apos;s aid .
it was recently officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men as well as visitors .
the exception is a wax before the door .
&quot; it is not ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated to say : every woman who comes here , has made his escape experience with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars because they are polit@@ ically persecuted , because they are torture or death , because their families send them their hopes for Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she tells us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in women , other reasons for the escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many steal away secretly because they don &apos;t see any other way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her home , they have experience with sexual violence , forced dis@@ appearance , slavery or forced st@@ itution .
this drives it off .
on the run goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , t@@ ug@@ boat demand a bottle of water a sexual desire is no rarity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who believe that the end as soon as they are in Germany , tell me , says B@@ ahr .
too , all women in refugee often would be considered to be min@@ ded and worse offen@@ ders .
this is that approximately 90 percent of women who live in the city of Munich , trau@@ mat@@ ised , estimates it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children are not voluntary for sure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are enough to say that they say nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they trust not to speak openly about the awak@@ ening , because the shame is too great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often do not want to help , there is more accommodations just for them , calls B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven regional governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question whether they are using a similar project , as in Munich in their condition , reply some with no .
in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz region and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there are so something in the tourist tax of governments .
even in Schw@@ aben alone , women were not accommodated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , Press Officer of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central fran@@ ken , there are several floors or own houses only for single @-@ standing women and their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations only for women .
also the &quot; rights of women and gender equality &quot; in the European Parliament is demanded that women have to be accommodated separated from men .
in a study published by the Committee , it is said : &quot; it is very important that men and women are separated . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the privacy or of men and women are accommodated together , it is too cold nour@@ ishing - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
above all the shower room should be separated and accessible for women , stands in the study .
as much to the women of this protective case , one can read the rush , which is on the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since he has been talking about us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could easily make a second house .
assist@@ ants strike : demands according to new labour measures
Deputy chairman of the assist@@ ants have called upon their union members , new labour measures in disp@@ utes regarding a new treaty .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) demanded its entire Council to appro@@ ve more workers from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that it had to be Minister of wor@@ ries on the wor@@ ries about the contract .
assistant to assist@@ ants and medical students have voted through the ref@@ us@@ al of a contract which was agreed with the BM@@ A .
it was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted for the elections .
in a letter to the members who was published on Thursday night on Twitter , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government had remained quiet@@ ly to problems what led to the contract .
she said , &quot; In view , the J@@ DC executive board voted to completely re@@ ject the proposed new contract and calls to all of the official new negotiations . &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board today placed a formal request at a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to appro@@ ve a running program of cal@@ ating workers , beginning of September .
the disp@@ utes agreed that assistance in this year had six times the first total cases in the history of N@@ HS .
after the election of the BM@@ A Assist@@ ance , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , after the vote on the agreed agreement , the BM@@ A had been recommended by the BM@@ A .
he distributed BM@@ A members during the meetings that took place before the vote by 54@@ ,000 assist@@ ants and medical students , that the contract should be beneficial and accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health , Jeremy Hunt said that the Treaty for Doc@@ tors in England would forced to force .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of Foreign Ministers &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended a crisis .
the leader of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give up his hands and an official end of the eight months of war with the words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counter@@ part in the gilded Hall of the St. Petersburg Pal@@ ast@@ es in reception , I cannot answer me that Ankara wants to make this reconciliation in most .
there were the towel , yes .
but putting the smile took nar@@ row@@ ly and it sh@@ atter@@ ed very warmth , even for his rest@@ rained conditions .
Recep Tayyip Erd@@ og@@ an , on the other hand , said to him of his &quot; loving friend &quot; Putin - according to a report about five times .
I could not count it anymore .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to its old level before the crisis , but even better to improve .
the next day described a newspaper that Erd@@ og@@ an would look like something than would never happen something .
to me , his enthusiasm seemed rather to interpre@@ t the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s bright , sustainable cooling showed that the government of Russia had nothing to forget .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first , which he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory remarks : the surplus of a Russian fighter aircraft by Turkey on the Syrian border .
Moscow from reaction to the time was w@@ ut@@ ent@@ bran@@ ched .
Putin divided and accused Ankara , who fell into the back .
the promise was even bigger , since it was committed by a promised friend .
the Vet@@ rop@@ es will re@@ build again and will not be impossible to be impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state @-@ controlled media carried out a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
once it seemed to be , the Turks would bear the gu@@ ilt for all the gu@@ ilt .
most serious were the alleg@@ ations of senior officials , that Erd@@ og@@ ans had benef@@ ited from the illegal oil trading in the areas of Syria , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he has cont@@ ested this v@@ eh@@ ement .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
finally this meeting took place only , because Putin received the exc@@ use of the President Erd@@ og@@ an , which he wanted to hear .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the benefits of a ce@@ ase@@ fire is clear at hand .
Erd@@ og@@ an needs first line all friends who he can get , after the last month at a failed coup d &apos;@@ etat of almost his ministry .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey had also sh@@ aken him .
but there are also economic moti@@ fs .
Russian sanctions imposed Turkish sanctions - in particular , the prohibition of char@@ ters , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number is dropped by almost 90 % .
in Russia , travel agents and charter companies will be facilit@@ ated if the flights will be resum@@ ed .
they count on a late ais@@ le an@@ storm to the Mediterranean .
this week , the state television forecast fruit and vegetables , as soon as the Turkish ag@@ r@@ arian were imported .
a report in Ve@@ demo@@ st@@ i form@@ ulated it as follows : &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional policy value for Moscow .
Ankara is w@@ asted on the West , since its response to the attempted power of power was considered a weak response .
in addition , the persist@@ ence Gro@@ ll come across the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ vot@@ al to move from the cool mood and to reduce the relationship between Turkey and the West .
Russian President Obama won a bonus for sure that he tried to test a coup d &quot; é@@ tat for the chosen state of government in Ankara .
that &apos;s good for Moscow is a self @-@ understanding that even has a deep@@ ening anxi@@ ety before reg@@ im@@ e@@ ism .
the summit in this beautiful palace at the sea adapted to Russia and Turkey , as it once described an analy@@ st once described , &quot; Alliance of out@@ sider &quot; : two countries which are cast away from the West and are po@@ or@@ ly treated by the west and is now prohibited .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still large differences between the two .
the greatest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave the role as a peace of peace , but where Russia and Turkey had to support other sites .
it might be a record that after almost three hours of first discussions on the press conference , they said that they had not stri@@ ped out the topic once .
the president of Turkey imp@@ lied it on a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphas@@ ize this .
there is no unique con@@ sens@@ us about it , where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open host@@ ility - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO &apos;s member of Turkey - is certainly better that the two heads of state will talk at least once again .
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland no longer available
according to the Bank &apos;s Chairman of the Bank , the R@@ BS brand is to be reduced to a Back@@ office roller according to the Bank &apos;s Chairman of the Bank .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will not be available for customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan distributed the BBC to Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was linked to the global amb@@ itions of the Bank .
the Bank has been dist@@ anced since then , when they had almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago .
in this period , brand new R@@ BS has used to protect other end consumers .
it supported the international Sport with million pounds of sponsor@@ ing , from the Six Nations Rug@@ by to Wimbledon winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she has decided to move more national stamps into the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , its headquarters and stock market will change to Nat@@ rue .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used to customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other , smaller brands for private customer business that will get more significance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ WAN has been inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Sh@@ ire .
he divided the BBC to Scotland with : &quot; the RS@@ B brand will be at our investment brand as well as to the brand , under which our employees will be busy , since we are now more to become a bank of brands . &quot;
when the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
I say now that we are not able to pursue global targets , but local targets .
each of these brands will stand in their own congregations for something completely different and our employees work among these brands with the customer .
R@@ BS has already said that it will not continue to continue its Six Nations Spon@@ sor@@ ing , and that it will increase the perc@@ us@@ ability of various brands in his sport sponsor@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s time for us to develop the brand of brands , for how do we focus on it inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the board of Directors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ n@@ ical three years ago , when we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and launched these stamps .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think there will see many changes .
we can recover these stamps again , therefore I think that the time has come .

I am ligh@@ tened and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori taking the Je@@ bel when he brings the victory for winning the victory

Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of modern@@ ity , and it &apos;s no surprise that he achieved this milestone just before him .
it has style and is powerful but it is the tac@@ tic intel@@ le@@ ct that differs it from another in weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and char@@ ism thr@@ illed fans for this kind of sport for years .

and he is not yet standing at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to keep going on in competitions until his at least 5@@ 0,@@ 10 years of age .
Russian Putin breath@@ s Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
according to Russian President Vladimir Putin , Russian President Vladimir Putin was released .
Ivan@@ ov was a lot of years of secret confi@@ denti@@ ality of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Representative for environmental and transport .
in a position of the Kre@@ m@@ lin it is that Putin has ordered his duties as chairman of the Russian pre@@ sidi@@ aries of his duties as chairman of the Russian pre@@ sidi@@ aries . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who had been deputy deputy since 2012 , was appointed to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is former diplom@@ at .
1972 in the Estonian capital city of Tallinn , he made his degree at the renowned Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy .
on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin it is ( in Russian ) that he later became protocol of protocol and staff manager of the g@@ overning party .
on his appointment he said to Putin : &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot;
I think it is the most important role of the government to support your activities as a state of government in regard to legislation and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin divided the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked his post to leave his position and suggested to V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
persu@@ ade the sm@@ iling faces ?
this step has been mysterious in Moscow .
Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov was a long time of one of the close confi@@ denti@@ ality Vladimir Putin and works as he was for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , who was broadcast@@ ed in television , both men claimed to return the staff at his own request .
but despite the lo@@ gistic action for cameras , only a few of them are convinced - especially in front of the parliamentary elections .
so is the result of a kind of power combat ?
this doesn &apos;t know nobody .
but the official statement - that a man who once had been pra@@ ising as a potential president , would like to introduce Russian environmental policy - slow on large sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism .
in his comments on Putin who are quoted on the site of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , Ivan@@ ov said &quot; It &apos;s true that I asked you in a conversation with me this very complicated item - one could almost say - pro@@ claiming for four years .
as it comes out , I &apos;ve been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months .
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and Putin &apos;s former member of the State Security Service K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , he was appointed Deputy Head of the K@@ GB .
as a Putin he called his name Ivan@@ ov as one of five people , whom he trusted in most .
once it was accepted that Ivan@@ ov had to be the second term President of Russia in the second term president of Putin , since a third term of putting into the Constitution would have been exp@@ elled against the constitution .
but this post has been taken by another , near ally the Put@@ to , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin was Prime Minister before he became the President three and a half years later .
Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gibson fired after winning producers
Gibson was involved in a physical strug@@ gles on the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
the ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , which produce the series , announced its not@@ ation in a common opinion .
Gibson , who played the Special agent Aaron Hot@@ ch@@ ner , ap@@ ologi@@ zed to Thursday before the announcement of his cancellation publicly .

I regre@@ t@@ ted the incident , &quot; he said in a communication .

Queens@@ land Cross@@ ing : bridge now connected to Fi@@ fe
the project &apos;s £ 1.@@ 35 billion project should be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the northern deck of the Queens@@ land Cross@@ ings with the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
it is the first of four closing of the &quot; stud blo@@ wers &quot; that the completion is approaching by each of the three towers of the bridge .
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it features 10.000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 tra@@ itors .
the project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
K@@ eit@@ h Brown took a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to come from the land to the bridge .
he said , &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment for the construction of the Queens@@ land Cross@@ ing .
we are all witnesses of a engineering drawing from a truly ep@@ ic measures in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were alone used for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the sh@@ utter between the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a p@@ agan activity that require extremely precise tolerances for the fit .
in total , almost 79 % of the total bridge de@@ cks are in their place and the last passage of the deck today gets in Ros@@ y@@ th a bet@@ ong@@ ated for the deck , which means that the total deck is ready to be lifted to its place .
Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Cross@@ ing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tor said : &quot; the first closure represents a significant milestone in the bridge project .
with this fantastic project , the closure of the future is future @-@ oriented and deep construction .
after installation of the last street @-@ cover and its connection with the north @-@ deck @-@ deck , we had to close the existing gap on the North or country side .
this was reached by pulling in the northern direction bridge 700 millimeters south .
this was a massive and very busy activity .
massive , because the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 meters long , approx . 6.000 tons weighs and had to be pulled down at an ascent of approximately 3 % .
while the tolerances , on which the team is working , they were tiny - on each side , they were only a few millimeters .
lu@@ ck@@ ily everything was very good .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men have &quot; happiness still alive ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad luck to his life &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after being thrown by her fishing boat in front of the Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI rescue station beat on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alarm , after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay .
the three men had difficulties to swim in security , while the boat came out of their own power .
&quot; we looked like the boat in her near to turn and set us the worst , &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately the strong winds have been awak@@ ened out of their range , until we left water &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat while the third man was exhau@@ sted at the age of 60 and at a bo@@ ard@@ y without a li@@ fe@@ jacket .
they all arrived on board of the coastal area and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The three men who were thrown into the water have been worse and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bo@@ ot@@ engine had a stop@@ watch over a not@@ stop@@ pl@@ one , but un@@ il@@ ted the boot from the bo@@ ilers of the Bo@@ ots by the person who controls the boat .
one has eight men today about these men .
hard viol@@ ated - man st@@ ings on his ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend
a man has attacked its Ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and seriously wounded .
as the police ha@@ sted yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old took the keys to get the apartment to get his personal things .
instead , the non @-@ alcoholic T@@ iller stim@@ ulates the clothes of his ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend .
when she came into the flat , he climbed twice on them twice .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured by the hand and the body .
the police could determine the perpet@@ rators .
during the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend , he called his mother .
this al@@ arms then became his sister .
together with her hab@@ end@@ anger@@ ed , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old would calm her brother .
but she couldn &apos;t move it to leave the apartment .
therefore she went with her li@@ ken@@ ess out of the house .
on the road they met the explosion of explosion of the man .
when the two women kept the apartment once again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old took his sister to the side and took his ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend .
who builds Braun@@ schwei@@ gs &apos;s cheap apartments ?
the SPD and green mine : investors will continue to be much stronger in the future .
how do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years ?
the SPD proposes a &quot; action concept &quot; in front of the elections .
but war is programmed .
first line is about the question : who is supposed to build the favourable homes ?
a regulation is missing so far .
in the SPD faction of the SPD : &quot; we are interested in the gre@@ enery with the Gre@@ ens : he wants to build up 20 percent of all apartments as social apartments in future . &quot;
the cheap apartments can also be built in the hol@@ dings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the great signs of the Town Hall is , however , Fr@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how do you want to build private areas in private areas ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to provide investors in such areas at least 10 percent , but as much as 20 percent of the apartments are build as social dwellings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new municipal housing program that will cost millions of costs and must be financed even for inc@@ en@@ tives .
the problem , so Fr@@ mann : &quot; there are currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot;
the CDU wishes to take investors as a few regulations .
the left hand has no hardness levels for investors .
regardless of what , the Brat@@ mann , a dis@@ appearance of the situation in the housing market .
will the action concept have been implemented , ensuring additional tasks within the building administration .
more staff is needed .
it is un@@ clear whether we will get the skilled workers .
but the program is not completely missing : because the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments that should be built .
but how do you compens@@ ate the loss of some 1300 favorable apartments , whose aim is to run out in the next few years ?
by 2020 , there will be 500 apartments .
to prevent this , the plann@@ er spokes@@ person Nicole Palm , should now be purchased out of the city now .
in addition , it would have to be thought about to get apartments back to the price connection again .
this is possible in the western city .
to get a blow to solve the problem .
because in the west city they run at the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments you could get back to the price connection for cheap apartments .
only : this would not want to do the owners , housing units .
because the number of social apartments in the western city is dra@@ stically increased dra@@ stically increases from the goal of the so @-@ called flow mixture .
a concentration of social in@@ w@@ aking in just a few districts is not to be given .
the green is that it will still be a movement in discussion .
the Group president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke believes : &quot; a vast majority must be the CDU with the boat . &quot;
I have concentrated on more buildings for one family homes .
but what does not mean that no compromise can be found yet .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
it is fascinating to see how the world changed .
that teen@@ ager and child did not go beyond outside , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time , on screens , was carried out in the last decade of many lam@@ ents .
at Pok@@ em@@ on Go it is about to get people from the sofa and to be active .
the time on the screen was limited to the TV , then limited to video games and last on smartphones .
therefore it &apos;s great to see that technology and outdoors will not exclu@@ de each other .
I have a course of course with the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characters initially created for the video games in the 1990s ( later there was a animation series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
how many phenom@@ ena of popularity fell interest in the US , Australia and New Zealand in early July .
market launch in other countries was post@@ pon@@ ed by the massive demand that over@@ load the server .
within a few days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; just said the player with their smart phones after outside and search for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons who have been pursued with a GPS , once they were found once again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; photographed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( about a screenshot of the mobile phone ) or &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the w@@ ahn and j@@ ump@@ ed for the search of the sofa .
in the USA the game led to a considerable increase in steps that return the &quot; average &quot; person every day .
Car@@ di@@ ac , an app for Apple Watch , who followed the 35,000 users , recently announced that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of people followed , that train every day 30 minutes , from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company doesn &apos;t know anyone who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only looks the raw data for the performance improvement .
many public awareness campaigns to health , people want to take &quot; 30 minutes of time &quot; to come &quot; from the sofa , &quot; because many public messages to health are bor@@ ing and to come from people who look like .
nevertheless , the meaning of sport can &apos;t be checked .
who regularly drives sports , reduces its chances to disease cancer or depression .
physical activity helps with weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of advantages that is too long to run it here .
but the wonderful to Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that people bring to do something outdoors , making them fun .
thus three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sun@@ shine , as well as fun .
some people close the hunt even new friends .
as always there are also m@@ oss@@ less toys , which must always compl@@ ain about anything .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what should it mean ?
it has a breakthrough .
even if smartphone apps had already been able to follow our activity as Fit@@ bit earlier , they gave us no reason to play sports like this game .
the new one will lose his maturity and use it with time .
however , due to poker &apos;s success , there will be more games to un@@ ite the apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world and will help many people on hunting , active , f@@ itter and heal@@ th@@ ier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates Gold in Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ ns
forget the print .

Simone Bil@@ es is immune to all that imm@@ un .
dynamic on the ski horse .
effortlessly on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
on a full line brilliant .
and now Olympic Champion now also .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American Tur@@ ner@@ in kl@@ kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday to the multi @-@ campaign bill and enlarged the gap between themselves and the rest of the world before all eyes under the head@@ light of the Olympic Games .
their overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was unique in front of the silver medal and &quot; Final Five &quot; team colleague A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian Bron@@ z@@ em@@ ed@@ ail@@ ers Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the Americans Simone Bil@@ es were playing on the floating @-@ bal@@ es during the single multi @-@ campaign women during the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osexual American woman who wins a multi@@ player title and a total of the fifth , while they fest@@ ed their reputation to be the best of their generation or even at all .
she broke out in tears , when their final result was shown and their long journey was found at this moment an end .
this success represents them in the same league like unique athletes like Michael Ph@@ el@@ ps , who brought their sports at new heights :
Bil@@ o has dominated the last three years of its sports art , 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that the Olympic Champion of 1984 Mary L@@ ou rescue from her said that she has ever seen &quot; the best gym@@ n@@ ine that I ever seen . &quot;
it was expected to be a final examination in Brazil , a contest that went not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather were over@@ sized between her and a last over@@ sized expectations .
do not return with a hand@@ ful gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered to be dis@@ appointment .
the Americans , Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man were poor , having each of them gold and silver in the retail@@ ing of women in gym@@ nast@@ ics for the Summer Olympics in 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es took the first medal at Tuesday , while on the f@@ arewell celebration of the team of retirement in Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi served as an emergency sign .
although it insi@@ sted on top of its long course on the top of its long course , it never has planned to have the future , isn &apos;t it true .
a part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling pass - is adapted to Latin American music , which would fit at home on the street outside of the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is no co@@ incidence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child , and was discovered by train@@ ee A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans &apos;s mother during a school trip to the gym , in which Bo@@ or@@ man trained , became the power .
since the summer of 2013 , she has lost no country competition in the summer of 2013 , a winning stre@@ ak , which will keep as long as it wishes .
even when Must@@ af@@ ina had made easy with two rot@@ ations , the picture bl@@ amed .
sister and soil particles - in which Bil@@ es holds the world championship title - no@@ isy .
she repeated with 15,@@ 433 on the bar @-@ bar and sat down with a 15.@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground .
Ra@@ is@@ man out@@ arm@@ ed them gently when she came to her end of du@@ ality - and tears , red , white and blue E@@ yel@@ iner , than the vision that they once described in their collective book , became reality .
the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was a reven@@ ge for the last time four years ago , when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal was going to a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke in Must@@ af@@ ina .
this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team capit@@ ulates that is called &quot; O@@ ma &quot; by the American &quot; O@@ ma , &quot; a lead .
after their practice , she threw herself to the audience of Kus@@ sh@@ ur , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes appeared to doubt .
as for Bil@@ es , the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a very new meaning that has quickly spread out the 19 @-@ year @-@ old from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims in series mur@@ der@@ ers during the music listening in the car
according to police reports that were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were killed , who were killed in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since one decade in the first series of mur@@ der@@ mal in the car , while they stopped playing music .
in June 12 , Angela Merkel &apos;s daughter , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a pilgrimage , the authorities said .
the perpet@@ rator eight shots from a hand @-@ fire weapon , while it stood on the passenger side of the car and fled with another vehicle to read in the report .
the police divided that the triple murder did not seem to have been the result of a prey , since the attack@@ ers did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 that were in possession of one of the adult victims .
the police man of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting was linked to an immediate view , whether it is linked to four previous attacks .
in total , predominantly in h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic residential buildings were killed in nine attacks in nine attacks and injured two others .
&quot; it happens in a residential neighborhood in front of a house , &quot; divided Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month .
it is believed to be used to susp@@ ect several vehicles , including a brown Nissan , from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to prove the evidence that they have been linked to the conclusion that attacks were associated and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hosp@@ ital@@ ized because of their injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died still on site .
a witness distributed to the police , that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ don car and listen to music .
the authorities published a police report on the shooting , which had gone on an empty pickup truck , half an hour before the three @-@ time murder , and assumed that it was the plant &apos;s work .
investig@@ ators found Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen and secured a sphere from the seat and glob@@ ular fragments from the engine compartment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro @-@ shar@@ ks : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is better &quot; &quot; &quot;
like most 6 year old Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves the singing , toys and of course his mother .
but like the least of his age@@ ing , Edmund Micro@@ ps , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy .
when he came home the first time , I was my first thought , I will not create it .
I do not create it .
I did not let me go .
what is not right at all -- of course one has settled on it , &quot; she said .
her husband Vincent and her husband informed that Edmund may never recognize them in circumstances that he may not survive any time .
some doctors had even so far that they pre@@ beat him to institutions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer to it was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still make it , &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Edmund can run with help of a help .
Edmund was able to neither sit nor cra@@ w@@ ling until his third year of life , but he still cannot speak .
but he makes slowly progress .
it can run with support and cycling .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the character language which Edmund suited for &quot; Please give me something in front . &quot;
&quot; we give it a character language , &quot; talked to Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News .
but there is no typical character language -- says it . Edmund has invented some signs alone .
micro@@ scope has a variety of causes : genetic as at Edmund as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or z@@ ic@@ av@@ irus during pregnancy .
symptoms and proj@@ ections can vary greatly .
it is still too early to tell how it will affect the life of infected with the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to commemor@@ ates the emotional prize of a certain future .
I asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and they still don &apos;t know .
I have no longer asked for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect that someone really can tell me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to have a hop@@ eful advis@@ ing for mothers of infants with birth @-@ damage caused by the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus .
it is better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .

the governor of Louis@@ iana John Bel Edwards distributed that state officials are standing in constant contact with local authorities and help the congregations concerned with the local authorities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Prepar@@ edness of the Govern@@ ors , divided up the en@@ quiries for flood vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags .
Ste@@ ele said that the village of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa would have had ten thousands of sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is inserted over long parts in the South Louis@@ ian@@ as until Saturday .
the weather service ordered that additional 3 to 5 inch of rain could fall in this area .
in the South of Serbia , a flood warning system was deployed on Friday , while the Mobile continues to rain .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the Am@@ ite River near Den@@ ham Springs , which are both in Louis@@ iana , will reach all lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood after the weekend record level .
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could floo@@ ded many houses in the suburbs of Bat@@ on Rouge .
he also said that a downstream flood pattern in A@@ scen@@ sion Par@@ ish represents a danger because those over the faithful rivers will run only slowly into the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the river A@@ fa@@ v , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi border border in Liverpool , Louis@@ iana , reached its highest position on Friday at 9@@ am .
rescue teams meet still people from the floo@@ ding and Wil@@ k@@ inson in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
Le@@ Roy H@@ ans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were saved on Friday in the vicinity of Glo@@ ster .

he said that another step@@ son , who lives in the vicinity , had warned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we aw@@ aked , and the water f@@ lowed and f@@ lowed in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ ans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my wa@@ ist .
his wife said H@@ ans@@ ford that she lived there in the 48 years in which she had never seen such a high rise of the river .
H@@ ans@@ ford said that he and his family members would have been the one who would swim .
H@@ ans@@ ford said that N@@ oth@@ el@@ fer had saved all three in a large military truck and had brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommodated until Friday .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the floods had stretched out quickly , because there was still heavy rainfall , there was still serious bre@@ aches that the authorities should consider evacu@@ ation instructions .
according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann a ob@@ servers near Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the soil is significantly al@@ lied with the rain since Wednesday .
authorities stated that heavy rainfall and road floo@@ ded the rescue of inhabitants from their houses in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa par@@ ish and teaching in five school districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary of WW@@ L reported that an or@@ derly in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had over@@ floo@@ ded 200 houses .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated in two churches , which now floo@@ ded both .
the pioneer of the commune of Ro@@ bby Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets that were r@@ ins@@ ed from the floods .
in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to host the evacu@@ ated evacu@@ ation .

in the town of Ham@@ mond the Municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of roads have been closed due to high water and sand@@ bags used for people who hope to keep water from their houses and shops .
&quot; the last major flood which we had , was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the municipal administration .
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ pp , the Not@@ ice manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of the Har@@ rison of Har@@ rison , said that at the Gulf Coast continue to rain .
according to his statements , a hand@@ ful of homes have been reported on Thursday than floo@@ ded , but on Friday , no gu@@ ised were reported .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen water in places where I have never seen it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and there is still . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mah@@ aj Brown , 6 , &quot; shaped spher@@ es , &quot; survived sli@@ cks in Philadelphia
the police divi@@ des that the 6 year old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a 6 year old child was shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him by C@@ BS Philadelphia as Mah@@ aj Brown .
the grand@@ parents reported that Brown was in@@ viol@@ ated several shots , including be@@ ating , leg , arm and belly , but that he was in hospitals at his transport into the hospital .
&quot; he has made a lot , his little body was pier@@ ced by balls , &quot; divided his grand@@ mother Del@@ ft Mel@@ en@@ dez to the transmitter .
I cannot believe that .
the condition of the boy was classified in a hospital as crit@@ ically and he had to under@@ go several operations .
the family of the boy told the transmitter to ensure that it is expected to be found .
he would have to begin the first class in a local primary school .
Brown was one of four people shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are according to C@@ BS Philadelphia in a stable state .
the boy was found on the front office of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old who was found in a critical condition , reports on the transmitter .
the other two victims were not found in the car and the police have just returned if they could be under one of the last men of the perpet@@ rators .
investigations divided C@@ BS Philadelphia with that it seems to have come to a cross between several arch@@ ers .
cartridge he@@ aps for assault ri@@ fl@@ es that have been tra@@ ced to different storm guns , super@@ se@@ ed the facts .
it seems that there are clearly tra@@ ded in the fight for a continuous battle .
on the road , on both sides of the go , there were envelop@@ es .
so it seems to have been several armed fighters to have been actively involved in the police , the police @-@ p@@ mann Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di police in Philadelphia to the transmitter .
there were also several houses and vehicles in the area .
there was no fixed and the police currently exam@@ ines reports about the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a trans@@ verse sl@@ ack@@ et on the arm when she played before her house in the neighborhood of West Oak Lane .
they recovered and the police still search for a susp@@ ects .
why We Need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I present myself under the Frauen@@ ol@@ ym@@ pi@@ er in the Tur@@ ns and the more than one reason .
first , I &apos;ve been doing so dominant since 1984 at every summer Olympics and the US have never been so dominant .
and second : these team has three tur@@ ner , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren , Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin colour .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew is and Madison Ko@@ cian , the Cath@@ o@@ kin is round , makes everyone proud .
this team does not reflect the United States .
it has the black and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic femin@@ ine presence at the fore@@ front of this kind of sport .
in the past four years the number one under the female gym@@ n@@ oses was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American woman .
last year , Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
that shows strength .
with the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprise Olympi@@ ad and in America .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez to be , as they were unexpected , but master@@ ful gy@@ ma@@ st@@ ic@@ rout@@ ines .
on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osexual American woman who won gold for women with an individual combined event .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we are experien@@ cing the top of this sport , but we do not see gym@@ nast@@ ics in the whole country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie struck all the same way as A@@ ly and Madison , to create it into the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Last Five , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the next Olympic Games is only four gym@@ n@@ ants in the crew . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi takes place as a train@@ ee . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the reality is that Tur@@ ns is an expensive sports , and Turner first can un@@ ite the first line in private gy@@ ms that will rise by parents , which will rise for training , entry , it@@ iner@@ aries , competition and hotel costs ( for the coach and their Turner and families ) . the list can be kept individually .
the majority of these gy@@ ms are located in we@@ al@@ thy suburbs , which can support the business .
in these clubs , Turner has a whole training and that is a dev@@ ise and long @-@ term commitment .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , Train@@ ee von Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained both their athl@@ ete since it started with the gym@@ nas@@ ium .
we have to be inspired by the municipalities of Au@@ d@@ inn@@ y , young girls that are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a powerful and easy @-@ to @-@ reach turn@@ around .
I founded my gym@@ nas@@ ium of 20 years .
at my events , we have offered free and affordable Tur@@ ns in Harlem for more than 15.000 people ( especially black and His@@ pan@@ ic ) , and national and international awards .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer high @-@ quality gym@@ nas@@ ium , who want to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
Tur@@ ns develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and fit for the spirit .
this combination offers li@@ fel@@ ong benefits for health and occupational and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that lets thousands of young girls get to be interested in the tur@@ rets and this is great .
it &apos;s so important to take part in the sport , especially for girls .
this is an exciting time .
thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ es of the Olympic World team and thank you that so many young girls are motiv@@ ated to get their way to get healthy , strong and successful young women .
assist@@ ants would like to organise additional strikes since they have rejected Jeremy Hun@@ ts proposal
the ministers had hop@@ ing to end the dispute over the changes due to the adoption of a re@@ formed contract with the func@@ tion@@ aries of British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37@@ ,000 assist@@ ants , who explo@@ red at a choice , refused him .
in July , Hunt plans were revealed to lead the contract , and said that N@@ HS had to present themselves in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; and every other de@@ cel@@ eration for employees and patients may be harmful .
the first assist@@ ants will receive a new contract , which contains changes to bed@@ side and weekend work to improve the maintenance of un@@ favourable clock times .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , Chair@@ woman of the BM@@ A Committee for Assist@@ enz@@ sts , last night in a communication with : &quot; Assist@@ enz@@ sts have to heat the proposed contract , particularly in particular , that it is the current issue crisis , and it is supposed to treat all doctors righte@@ ously . &quot;
at only eight weeks , which still remain until the first group of doctors had to fall under the new contract , progress must be made and the time runs out .
efforts by the BM@@ A for the solution of disp@@ utes by talks with the government on contra@@ ctions and sometimes on o@@ hren@@ stun@@ ted silence .
this was done by a mistake that Jeremy Hunt had made the last month on the last month , that his door would still open .
&quot; Jeremy Hunt must now act , raise the conc@@ iliation and talk the wor@@ ries of the assist@@ ants . &quot;
if he did not do this , the assist@@ ants have made clear that they are ready to perform further workers .
the last strike at the end of April saw a boost of nearly 13,000 rout@@ ines and 100.000 dates , as n@@ urses and experts were involved to grant doctors on strike @-@ post@@ ure cover .
the ministers had hop@@ ing to end the dispute over the changes due to the adoption of the Re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A would like to be a better week@@ day re@@ mun@@ eration for the 54@@ ,000 assist@@ ants that will be subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ si , Director of the N@@ HS employees , invited Assist@@ ance to the strike to strike the strike .
Mor@@ ho@@ ever said : &quot; working light measures do not reach the only little , but already loaded teams and service providers and prepare patients , care and their families only wor@@ ries , need and break . &quot;
in the last two months , we talked about to have been speaking with the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Health as well as other minist@@ ries with respect to the jur@@ idi@@ fication and the W@@ hist@@ leb@@ low@@ ings .
the employer hop@@ ed that this continued positive engagement to other important topics - how to return , flexibility for training , training session , mutual recognition of teaching , training session , health Education , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health related to compliance with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day drug , that can reduce heart attacks
thousands of heart attack patients are benef@@ itted from a £ 2 @-@ day drug , after suggested by the authorities to date this more people for a longer period of time .
the inner medicine T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with a cardi@@ ac disease .
the medicine is administered for 12 months after a heart attack which reduces the risk of a stroke if a further heart attack is reduced .
the N@@ HS regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
about 14@@ 0,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by gathering of fet@@ al material in the ar@@ tery walls , the flo@@ or@@ ings form .
if the layer falls apart , it may cause blood cl@@ ots to hide the blood flow up to the heart and caused a heart attack .
if the blood cl@@ ots solves , it can flow through the blood stream and causes blood flow to the brain , which causes a stroke .
people who had already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ c@@ eca and is distributed under the trade name Br@@ ili@@ que , reduces this risk by elim@@ in@@ ating the formation of blood cl@@ ots .
the N@@ ICE line design , which was published today , recommends 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg , with twice daily intake of asp@@ ir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long son , director of the N@@ ICE health education centre said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who suffered a heart attack , a further heart attack or stroke , often with des@@ per@@ ate consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack may have considerable effects on quality of a person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with asp@@ ir@@ in effective in reducing other heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who had already had a heart attack .
with a preliminary recommendation of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of blood is limited to a period of up to three years . the bill recommends no treatment that goes over this period .
culture of the Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness , election amounted to Muslim areas
the former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man last year on request of a government report for corruption of the office
a culture of the Political Cor@@ rect@@ al Party has led to under@@ estimated that the broad election was igno@@ red in Muslim communities , as a devastating government report today .
former member of the former member of Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es banned the police , election observation and Rath@@ geber for it to have no evidence of election abuse regarding eth@@ nic@@ ity and religion . &quot;
the former minister of integration and municipal government , which is now a ant@@ ech@@ ru@@ ction , said that the en@@ rol@@ ment of voters from religious moti@@ fs would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set shut@@ down outside of choice cabins to protect ro@@ aring voters .
he recommends that voters should guide their identity in order to prove their identity in elections .
at the moment , a voters must only call his name and address .
the report does not beat distances onto the finger of a person if they vote her elec@@ toral voice to prevent someone twice .
W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower should get more protection , Sir Eric says .
he calls for the press to find out more access to the community documents and decisions of non official com@@ missions or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not only against election , but should also protect the municipal government before the wider corruption and financial crisis , which leads to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said he . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by the Dow@@ ning Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets &apos;s election campaign in the east of London .
last year , a special District Court decided that the Mayor &apos;s mayor for Rah@@ man should be accounted for a Lit@@ an@@ ei on a Lit@@ an@@ ei and illeg@@ itim@@ ate practices of his ministry .
the court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community , &quot; and he had per@@ ver@@ ted his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ res at the silence .
Rah@@ man should have led to &quot; its campaign on the basis of having a cor@@ di@@ ous duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
up to 300 voices were either du@@ bi@@ ous or the result of a re@@ spiration , if one person cho@@ oses other than someone else .
Sir Eric said that it was evidence of the whole country of dec@@ am .
in particular , he expressed himself in particular al@@ ar@@ ming for fr@@ au@@ dul@@ ent letters - at the older members of the Muslim community print on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , as illustrated , made several recommendations to make the elec@@ toral system , including the joining system to prove the identity
in his report , it means that pressure on protection members had been exercised by some ethnic min@@ orities , especially women and young people in order to choose the elderly , especially communities with Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ian or ban@@ anas in background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was a concerns that ... state institutions have ignor@@ ant such behaviour as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; polit@@ ically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over Eth@@ nie and Religion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition to edit political activists .
the report , which is drawn by Ther@@ esa May in hei@@ g@@ ation , requires even har@@ der registration checks to prevent the elec@@ toral list of immig@@ ration and social bet@@ ting purposes .
consider options to ask voters looking forward to your ID card .
not long ink upon the finger of a person use once they have released their voice to prevent one twice cho@@ oses .
systematic transfers over the nationality of a person to ensure that they are voting right .
a three @-@ year @-@ old limitation on applications for an automatic post@@ code .
ban on the political activ@@ ist and envelop@@ es of letters .
the police force the fug@@ al to establish shut@@ down around the election stations .
an amendment to an amendment to the People Act 1983 of the People Act 1983 of the People Act 1983 of the People Act 1983 .
photographer b@@ ade in election stations .
requirement that only English may be used in choice stations ( with exception of Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training in order to ensure that the employees take the rule out that voters enter into the elec@@ trol@@ l alone .
Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ let case no penalty was placed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the elec@@ torate has Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy members for a Lit@@ any of cor@@ ted and illegal practices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
based on a number of reasons for suff@@ iciently en@@ su@@ ing - in accordance with the high requirements of the criminal proceedings .
it also critic@@ ises the effective &quot; Ab@@ h@@ ak@@ control &quot; of elec@@ toral registration departments .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the Court of Court in Tower Ham@@ lets of last year was a warning signal .
our country , as the mother of par@@ liam@@ ents , is a proud heritage , but the concern of constitu@@ ency and conce@@ al of some authorities thre@@ aten it to this good reputation .
crazy according to K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ der and other famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger from Olympi@@ ad in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio will come on this week via the French bike artist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot , who has proven itself as an impressive double @-@ singer of the Du@@ chess in Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympi@@ on@@ ik@@ in is not the only one of the only gold batt@@ ling Ath@@ let which has its own famous doubles - at least not when one must give the social media of faith .
in honour of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces , which are currently on our screens , FE@@ MA@@ IL has an lists on the Olympi@@ on@@ ics , which feature more than just a certain simil@@ arity with the Hollywood star celebr@@ ities .
h@@ unters and the Wolf : team member of the U.S. team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o since his childhood .
apart from a double @-@ singer on the Rad@@ ren@@ n@@ run@@ way , many people are travelling on the Internet as a certain she@@ et@@ cher of the Di@@ dy@@ mus of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o .
the team member of the U.S. team in Arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a storm on Twitter , after images on which he looks similar to the Wolf of Wall Street star in secretly .
in fact , the arch@@ ist got the mad@@ ness to the social media , and gave him to hear that he had already been able to hear his childhood , that he looks like Leo .
&quot; I myself see no big simil@@ arity , except the fac@@ ial hair@@ y , &quot; divided Bra@@ dy by Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a ben@@ evol@@ ent guy , so I hate it as a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will und@@ ou@@ bt@@ edly focus more into the center : the up@@ lifting simil@@ arity between British Con@@ struc@@ tor Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris .
the Russian gym@@ n@@ in Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with its great , expres@@ sive eyes is to pass through a double @-@ singer for the Cub@@ an American singer Gloria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool , the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh is compared with the G@@ lee Star Matthew Mor@@ rison .
a speed higher : this user is the view that Nathan the &quot; athlet@@ ic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption is acting
another long @-@ lasting comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h hard , which is similar to the ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medals in Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova shows more than just the sun@@ lit skin and bl@@ on@@ den hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian von fans came to the same &quot; athlet@@ ic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
powerful women : soccer star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jenni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar fac@@ ial form and eyes
not only the only one : one Twitter User was very happy about that others have also enjoyed the simil@@ ar@@ ities
theory in the room : according to this user there is a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple may be a reason
a Twitter U@@ ser@@ in declared their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the Internet th@@ inks that Hope Solo and Jenni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot;
in fact , the U.S. soccer star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jenni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter is an incredibly similar point of visual perception and eyes .
other popular compar@@ es Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , who is almost identical with the act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney and the gold medal in the Tur@@ ns Gab@@ by Douglas , who has its own beautiful , broad smile , that is similar to bring It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .

the comm@@ ent@@ ator Byron Mac@@ D@@ onal@@ ds thought that his microphone was off at the end of the 4x@@ 200m fre@@ il@@ tan@@ gles created his own opinions .
Mac@@ Donald , who had been picked up in the commentary team of C@@ BS to give more &quot; colour &quot; could say : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
she was too excited as M@@ ief , he died like a pi@@ g .
thank you for this .
the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers in Ai Y@@ an@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second leg of the swimming pool 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Kan@@ adas Taylor Ru@@ ck , which enabled the Canadian player to close the gap in China .
spectators were re@@ acted quickly online after they were sho@@ cked to the sound and the language .
Em@@ met@@ t Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ets , &quot; H@@ as the C@@ BC comm@@ ent@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old flo@@ ats from China &quot; like a pi@@ g died ? ? ? ? ?

Ai Y@@ an@@ han from China was described in the final 4 x 200m exemp@@ li@@ vel@@ st@@ aff@@ le for women , saying : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
the critic@@ isms of Byron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came fast and hard , where many of them asked him to speak .
Twitter User didn &apos;t know when they heard how un@@ sen@@ si@@ bel Byron Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter U@@ ser@@ in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; Wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald .
you just unveil@@ s the C@@ BC and Canada only and lets us look like h@@ assi@@ sts . # ange@@ ek@@ elt .
short time later , Scott Rus@@ sel , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC broadcast live , live for the comment of Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze to us that the comment was transmitted over a swimming performance . &quot;
it was an un@@ fortun@@ ate chosen formulation , sorry that it happens . &quot;
C@@ BC remains at the end of the 90 time in the people who responded to the Not@@ ice on Twitter
the commentary volume Scott Rus@@ sel had to bl@@ ame himself in the name of Mac@@ Donald
C@@ BC copied and added his exc@@ use to more than 90 other Twitter reviews that had worth the comments of Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network promp@@ ted quickly and gave a message to them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we regre@@ t it correctly that these statements were made and it was possible to broadcast them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yesterday night , we enjoyed our audience with our spectators at the show and our followers together in the social media .
to clear one , B@@ yr@@ ons comments on the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as person .
nevertheless , they were in@@ adequate and un@@ fortun@@ ate chosen formulation . Byron does that which he said , very sorry .
on Thursday , Mac@@ Donald has ap@@ ologi@@ zed and tried to just@@ ify his re@@ mark by telling that it was not the intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to answer me for the comment , whom I made after the cre@@ ws of the C@@ BC Olympic season , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and didn &apos;t go to them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course there was no mis@@ cont@@ emp@@ t and I &apos;m sorry . &quot;
buyers in Pri@@ mark wor@@ shi@@ ped a woman who had tried in the middle of the store
the buyer did not know where they should see when a woman moved their clothes in the midst of a Pri@@ mark to try pr@@ un@@ ing .
to wor@@ sen the situation , she numbered her , as she saw in it , and laid it back into the shelf .
you find further and tried four pairs of under@@ p@@ ants in a business in Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping centre in Folk@@ estone , on .
the Pri@@ mark Business in Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Mall in Folk@@ estone , in whom the woman tried her under@@ p@@ ants before she put back into the shelf .
a mother of two children , J@@ enny David@@ son who had been at the same time in the shop said that after the mysterious woman had tried her under@@ wear , &quot; she returned and the business left without buying something . &quot;
she said , &quot; people could not believe what they saw . &quot;
in the middle of the sales area , she recorded a pair of p@@ ants from the situation , moved her own Str@@ um@@ p@@ ants and tro@@ users and tried them .
&quot; she did not attempt to find something discre@@ et place to do it - she was simply there , fre@@ ch as Oskar . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ red when she returned to her under@@ p@@ ants , which you didn &apos;t like to put her back to the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same with three other sub@@ s@@ ants before she finally decided that her right had@@ n &apos;t felt that he was dancing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it seemed not to be anno@@ yed that someone observed - or think about the person who had tried to try under the circumstances that she had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. David@@ son , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would think that someone would take to my home , who had a second person and had not been washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident happened on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. David@@ son added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I have received , the staff are trying to pull the clothes from the sale , after she went - what exactly is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate it with a new pair of pr@@ un@@ ks to go home and find out that another woman had her , and had not washed them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker of Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is the case that happened on Tuesday 9th August in our branch in Folk@@ stone , deliber@@ ately &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

how to protect oneself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a prior to arms
the world outside is a dangerous place but this video from D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it something saf@@ er for you .
we spoke to Rh@@ on Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to move away with armed rob@@ bers on the distance .
regardless of whether you &apos;re looking forward from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to flip over the sp@@ ear .
if you &apos;re ste@@ amed up from behind , then you should be able to see your attack@@ ers and give you out of the line , &quot; says Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi .
take the gun then between your fore@@ arm and your shoulder before completing it with your free el@@ bow .
beat him with the knee into the l@@ ath , and turn off , while the attack@@ ers have collap@@ sed , the weapon from his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move back , while the weapon is set on him .
in case of attack@@ ers , the technique is similar - move your body from the line , take the weapon and turn it off , so that the attack@@ ers can &apos;t shoot .
aband@@ on the weapon at the same time and beat the gun on the chest , then turn the weapon from his handle before they move back and face the weapon .
sounds difficult ?
take a look at the video to see how it does Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that there is a spoil to the saf@@ est , your money is sufficient - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ masters .
Reis@@ er Ian Wright for a guide to guide his tongue to the dirty sites of Europe
a British travel subject to the immune system and saus@@ ages of serious examination - by some of the dirty and most beautiful places of Europe .
the moder@@ ator and it@@ aut@@ or Ian Wright , 51 , from Suff@@ olk , his course on a euro notes , a rail@@ ing at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Cir@@ cus , a r@@ ins@@ ing bow in Russia as well as a public phone in Russia to provide the resistance to the immune system under proof .
in front of any object , he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer to meet and to show us what he is going to let down .
but the experiment , that was filmed under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; brought some surprising results in daylight .
the thought , the r@@ ins@@ ing button of a access toilet block , which was already used by thousands of others , mag can be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen .
in his journey through Europe , Mr Wright said with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intest@@ inal bacteria , as well as his own health .
lu@@ ck@@ ily nothing was left , he left nothing more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. Wright became known to test the resistance of its intest@@ ines by being travelled through the world and ate in@@ firm@@ ities as well as wonderful things .
from public transport to railway stations up to dish@@ w@@ rest@@ ling of toilets , the task posed the immune system definitely under a sample
in the film he told us : &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned , regarding my health and I have put all possible things in my mouth , Earth , wor@@ ms and sl@@ umber water . &quot;
in the movie he was justified for his call .
the only thing he refused , was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his pro@@ ofs showed a L@@ umin@@ omet@@ ry of more than 4000 units .
in comparison , the L@@ umin@@ omet@@ ry length amounts to less than 60 .
but there was a Russian lav@@ ender that he refused to ref@@ res@@ h more than 4000 units , while fresh washed hands have less than 60 fighters .
Mr Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; which shows the bacterial number of various places such as bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the worst thing I have taken in a toilet , close &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing of dirt than that !
I am unable to put here , because it is inside the inside .
&quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company uses Mr. Wright with Vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria , as well as vitamin C and D , to support the support of intest@@ inal bacteria and the immune system .
validation Senior Venice President for snacks , ju@@ ices and New categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer a little new thing .
something that is fascinating for watching and at the same time explains Pro@@ biot@@ ics .
we conducted a crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings , which thus did we said &quot; Let us call us Ian . &quot;
you claim that the interest of intest@@ inal health to a global phenomenon is becoming a global phenomenon
instead only talking about the products , we wanted to put them in a bigger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of the intest@@ inal health and how it is associated with the immune system .
the growing interest in the intest@@ inal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide information about more information on an interesting way .
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the direc@@ ting of the film , added : &quot; let me lose my respect for Ian , if he have tast@@ ed some of the things I have been sent to him , as the ek@@ y Russian toilet that will be shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things in which it easier to bring Ian to bring her , they tail and others , where this was rather difficult .
I &apos;m glad that we have recorded some of these dirty le@@ ak@@ ages on the film . &quot;

A@@ social family destroyed social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
one of the genocide family left their social apartment after a del@@ og@@ ation with a damage deposit of £ 50,000 because they had terror@@ ized their neigh@@ bors .
T@@ anya sk@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown into a long list of complaints from her estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after they were for@@ ci@@ bly removed from the estate , sho@@ cked workers of housing cooperative found the property in an ir@@ repaired state .
the walls mar@@ vel@@ ed holes on wood panels were torn down , tr@@ ash was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubric@@ ated to the walls .
the family were settled and it is believed to be in a private accommodation now
Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ o@@ y , who works for home management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that she fears that the apartment is no longer to repair .
she said , &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare here and I am the view that people must not live in this way .
there are many things to take account since this property is probably not considered as beautiful part of the Corn@@ elius .
the family is inf@@ am@@ ous and their reputation is the same .
the pair had three sons , who lived for the time in the apartment and the police said that the terror , which had added the family , road f@@ umes with bas@@ eb@@ ooks , drugs trade , drug tra@@ ff@@ icking , drug tra@@ ff@@ icking , drugs and flu@@ ence included .
sk@@ el@@ don , 47 , whose name stood on the lease agreement , got an order for ant@@ is@@ o@@ cial behavior in June .
in some areas of the house , which is torn down under circumstances , old gar@@ bage was found
there were in the estate where drugs have been tra@@ ded in the past drugs .
neighbours said that they had to fight them on the streets and had to be called the police regularly .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ og@@ ed them and their partner up this week for@@ ci@@ bly from the property after they gave them a prolonged period of 11 weeks to volunte@@ ering voluntarily .
the Del@@ og@@ ation were che@@ ered by facilit@@ ated neighbours , saying that their lives were made to hell .
one said , &quot; They were ashamed of no one . &quot;
we lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad .
the countless times that we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today we couldn &apos;t sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stood here , because it was so quiet - that we are not used !
now , wherever they &apos;re finally gone , it will be nice .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it would have the family to co@@ operate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police was called regular intervals , 20 years long .
on the above side of the Municipal Building , tr@@ l and old toys were thrown down
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dis@@ grace that the ten@@ ants of the les@@ sees , any responsibility for their behavior and to their family , since a delay is always the last step , the Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing into account . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was a very difficult event , because the behaviour was extremely difficult and to see their deeds for her neighbours .
I guess all the work which my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the church , who have joined us and have made us the information we have made .
I hope that these developments will not be toler@@ ated for some neigh@@ bors who will not toler@@ ate the message that ant@@ is@@ o@@ cial behavior is not toler@@ ated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three children had lived at different times in the house , but they all have over 20 .
one dirty mattress in one of the bedrooms of the house after the Del@@ og@@ ation on the ground .
workers of the household administration must now have gar@@ bage flowers , which sur@@ round the house
in 2014 , the police introduced a raid in the house and found more than 70@@ g cannabis as well as orph@@ agen , par@@ ap@@ her@@ al@@ ies and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
the sk@@ el@@ don received a fine of money after being found guilty of a drug of class B in trade views .
it claimed that the money for a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in 2013 with a car accident .
after being without the roof , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner now lives in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ymouth .
many rooms of the house were honoured with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says that they are ten@@ ant to enter into the house @-@ order
Angela C@@ row from the Devon and Corn@@ wall police divided that the Del@@ og@@ ation keep a clear warning to the other ten@@ ant that do not hold on the assignment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is going to those who can think themselves without self @-@ prec@@ urs@@ or , as well as those who were killed by such a behaviour , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall will never toler@@ ate criminal and ant@@ is@@ o@@ cial behavior , which continue to work together with partners to protect our churches .

Donald Tr@@ ump dre@@ aming &quot; massive problems &quot; in the election campaign
the leadership of the US Rep@@ ublic@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive wor@@ ries , also in traditional German states m@@ ashed their majority .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now handed down the weakness of his election campaign in the Republi@@ can Hoch@@ burg Ut@@ ah .
a more rare moment , in which the usually big @-@ track and sel@@ f@@ confident multi @-@ tim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire would be something like concerns expressed as correspon@@ d@@ ants reported .
after having cast 16 ri@@ vals on the race within their own republi@@ can camp , the doub@@ ts now grow in the battle for the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have massive problems in Ut@@ ah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Tr@@ ump in front of evangel@@ ical Christians who he asked for support in important federal states like Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
false reports shall be found on its candi@@ dat@@ ure , he took up his well @-@ known media reports .
republi@@ can tor@@ ches W@@ ack@@ ing
Ut@@ ah is usually a secure bank to rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
according to a survey by Sur@@ vey@@ or , from June , Tr@@ ump and his compet@@ itor was according to the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton at the same time .
other institutes see Tr@@ ump in front of , but not with the distance that for Republi@@ can candidates are usual in the state .
as end@@ anger@@ ed , Arizona and Georgia apply .
in an interview with the station CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump answered the question , as he would stop the march of Clin@@ t . &quot; just as I have made it so far . &quot;
and if you leave , this will be &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot;
he doesn &apos;t make anything else to tell &quot; the truth . &quot;
in case there are no rich in order for him in the end of the political correc@@ t@@ ness , this is okay , said Tr@@ ump .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the Communist Party of Tr@@ ump is supposed to submit money to support his elec@@ toral campaign , it should not be able to present a better change values .
instead of what I would like to find the candidates of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans for Congress stronger than the arms .
Olympia : tri@@ ister Sc@@ am at D@@ oping test
the IOC wants to judge a discipline for discipline .
Kenya &apos;s athletes are threatened with the second D@@ oping aff@@ air to the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
having a d@@ oping control in the Olympic village in Kenya , Kenya sent a coach to your home .
the International Olympic Committee decided to set up a discipline to investigate the case in order to investigate the case .
an Austrian func@@ tionary func@@ tioned that the former Sprinter and current coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic village a ur@@ ine sample under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ L@@ ater Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i .
this is the team line of Kenya from the D@@ oping control scores .
the World Association IA@@ AF has searched the IOC to deal with information about the case to rig@@ orous research , divided an IA@@ AF speaker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IOC , the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was named in an IA@@ AF statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone to D@@ oping control station and signed up as Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , the rehear@@ sal and signed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ken@@ ias boss de Mission Stephan ar@@ ap So@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the possession of the cre@@ dit@@ ation of the athl@@ ete , which stood on the list for training control of the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency .
Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich has become more than 800 metres in Beijing world championship in 2015 .
four days ago the Ken@@ yan athlet@@ ics officer Michael Rot@@ ich had been deduc@@ ted from the Rio Olympics .
he is alleged to have informed about cash payments athletes of his country about the standing d@@ oping test .
according to media reports , he report@@ edly arrested its return at the airport of Nairobi .
Kenya has already been under special observation for the IOC to the amount of d@@ oping c@@ oping for longer period .
with the announcement of the more than 2000 d@@ oping target controls in front of the Rio Olympics it was noted that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia are taken into the vis@@ or .
the world Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency had been able to play a lot of pressure on the African country in Brazil , an anti @-@ d@@ oping law and a working control system in Brazil .
the law was approved a few weeks before the Olympia starts .
as a result , WA@@ DA Kenya has taken Kenya from the list of countries whose d@@ oping control form conform to WA@@ DA rules .
Kenya is regarded as major runner @-@ nation .
athletes of the country took the most medals in Beijing at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a series of TV reports of the ARD , ARD have always been le@@ aded out to be easily accessible to Kenya &apos;s d@@ oping means and there will be a significant ment@@ ality of the sports bet@@ ru@@ gs .
IOC member Richard Po@@ und finally invited a similar investigation in Kenya as he had asked them in the Russian track .
it could be proven that in this kind of sport and systematic op@@ t .
Russia &apos;s athletes were excluded from the summer play .
Salzburger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli
in the Shakespeare @-@ Year the Salzburg Festival plays the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Mary as a tragic lovers , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et .
with a surprising Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conquered Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ one masterpiece .
the artistic director Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical in the temple of the classical music and filled with the role of Mary a youth dream .
in the orchestra , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra conducted by Gust@@ av@@ o D@@ ud@@ amel Orchestra conducted by Gust@@ av@@ o D@@ ud@@ amel : &quot; this music is full of rhythm . &quot;
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their temp@@ o and their mel@@ ody .
it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have lear@@ nt music really in our blood !
in this st@@ aging , Bart@@ oli plays a lot of wor@@ ried Maria .
she is remin@@ is@@ cent of her lovers with Tony , while younger Mary plays and dancing .
the role of Mary has always fascin@@ ated me .
first , because it is musi@@ cally extraordinary !
and then there would be Mar@@ ias &apos;s personality .
she says it in her song : &quot; I am Pre@@ t@@ ty , oh such a Pre@@ t@@ ty , I @-@ Pre@@ t@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
it is therefore smart , of course also n@@ ai@@ v , and very passionate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she resem@@ bles me very , my Italian character , whom I have considered to be Rö@@ mer@@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; laugh@@ s Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ ud@@ amel is full of lob@@ es for the opera @-@ singer : &quot; Cec@@ ilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such a honor to work with you .
she is an illeg@@ itim@@ ate person .
and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ments : &quot; D@@ ud@@ amel is an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting , it is a need .
you can see it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life !
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with it .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a che@@ er@@ ful approach to life , which is very important at all !
for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; : &quot; in this piece it &apos;s about pre@@ ference parts and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism . &quot;
today we had the refugees , at that time the Pu@@ er@@ tor@@ ic@@ ans went to New York , and the New York residents did not want to .
they are the same topics , and they are as little as little as at that time .
59 years later the piece is still relevant .

Turkey : Kur@@ dish municipality counts with mass cur@@ ses
&quot; who doesn &apos;t fit and trem@@ bling , sits on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the Presidency of the Gü@@ len @-@ oriented Foundation Dialogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un .
the Kur@@ dish municipality in Germany expects short term of tens of thousands of people who fled from Turkey to Germany .
during the medium term , it could even be &quot; some hundred thousand &quot; are believed to believe Ali Top@@ ra@@ k .
due to the hard work of the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erd@@ og@@ an after the coup attempt , the Kur@@ dish Community expects a mass flight to Germany in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; long @-@ term I reck@@ on with tens of thousands of thousands of thousands of people from Turkey in Germany if the Erd@@ og@@ an regime fought the min@@ orities and the democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the federation leader Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the government had crossed the government in front of months with pen@@ sions , 500,000 Kur@@ ds within Turkey on the run .
after the failed coup , sec@@ ular and op@@ positi@@ onal ethnic Turks are added .
many will rest@@ art in Europe if they are going to be supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that himself has committed themselves to refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chief of Staff accused Syria of Syrian Arab in Kur@@ dish , but also in al@@ ev@@ it@@ ic cities .
with this , Erd@@ og@@ an increase the transfer pressure on the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks , already extinct in the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a member of the CDU member .
the Chief of Staff demanded that the Federal Government made itself as sharp as Austria against Erd@@ og@@ an and its tra@@ ilers . &quot;
also in Germany , a &quot; wit@@ ch @-@ hunt &quot; on Erd@@ og@@ an critics were held .
I feel no longer in Germany for the first time in the last months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
more Turks are looking for asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Opp@@ os@@ ition@@ ists .
the fire markings as a Gü@@ len tra@@ ilers are destroyed by teachers and other academ@@ ics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever doesn &apos;t fit and trem@@ bling , sits on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and sec@@ ular , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dialogue and Education , the &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
like the newspaper on appeal by the German Interior Ministry , the Turks already reported the largest group of asylum seek@@ ers in Germany before the coup .
as at the reporting date June 30 , this is 11.@@ 386 people and thus almost 29 per cent of all known as as@@ yl@@ s acknowledged ( 3@@ 9.@@ 625 ) .
in this survey you can &apos;t find the war , poverty or per@@ el@@ ess@@ ness .
asylum seek@@ ers after the Basic Law are exclusively polit@@ ically , so by state side , individual off@@ ences .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ ommern : &quot; where to go where it does &quot;
Sel@@ ts@@ ames Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ ommern : the loc@@ als will not receive nothing from the summer election campaign , and the tourists from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia must not choose the country .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ ommern , they understood them .
in 2021 , the Parliament election will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwerin parliament decided at the beginning of the year .
because of so far it does not expect : summer holidays , heat and landing combat - that bit@@ es itself .
the loc@@ als that are convinced of the elec@@ tive gi@@ ants are to be on holiday .
the most popular tourists , which are in the country , are on U@@ se@@ dom , R@@ ügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not a native , but not allowed the country &apos;s day .
there are practical problems : in the holidays , hel@@ pers are able to impos@@ e the posters , distribut@@ ing air bal@@ lo@@ ons , fl@@ yers and rub to the end of the vote only .
until the 4th of September , 2016 , the election and last day of the last day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ ommern has to pass , once again , the candidates have to pass over themselves .
the hot phase , if you can say it at all , has just started .
and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CDU coalition , must fear his ministry .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly visible behind the CDU .
exciting how strongly Ne@@ ul@@ ing Af@@ D cuts and what remains at the end of co@@ al@@ itions .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years of age and since 2008 Head of Government , makes an almost in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous election campaign , you can see from his grand@@ parents .
he travels across the country , spread Ros@@ en and pl@@ au@@ ts a little with the people , as it did already be the legendary thing of his legendary Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff .
otherwise , past@@ ing has got cold feet and gives Merkel the gu@@ ilt on the bl@@ ossom of the Af@@ D .
your refugee policy , you &quot; We are able to make the &quot; rise of the sp@@ ear lists , which will probably be the beautiful office now .
the CDU with their peak data , the Minister of the Interior Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has experienced , as it is , if you &apos;re doing a right place in the right place .
she has invited two Chancellor Angela Merkel to grandfather ; Merkel &apos;s German Bundestag is in the northeast .
but the target group did not agree that there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg @-@ Westphalia and Vor@@ p@@ ommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accused Vincent Kok@@ ert , General Secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ ommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there too bad anyone from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel can hear .
otherwise the North East @-@ CDU do not ren@@ ounced the usual election conference on market courses and shopping m@@ alls with umbre@@ l@@ las and air bal@@ lo@@ ons .
this , that co@@ stum@@ bled , plays only a &quot; minor role . &quot;
the union also noted that in the country you feel the base , it has to be very severe , to meet again a wire to the people .
it is like the left , the SPD , the green : there hardly exists in the times of the country .
however , the Council of the CDU elec@@ torate Kok@@ ert to his fel@@ low@@ ites is also sel@@ f@@ ere : &quot; they are going to go where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ est , Golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
because much on the game , Sell@@ ering has set up its SPD in a particularly committed election campaign .
in surveys , Socialists and Democrats last with 22 per cent behind partners CDU ( 25 ) and just just just before Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
in the election of 2011 , the SPD still won 3@@ 5.6 percent in front of the CDU ( 22 ) .
the green , small party with seven percent in poll@@ s , could be made to the leap into the Parliament .
they make a modern way out of the holidays needs a modern T@@ ug@@ end and create a large number of seats on the internet .
&quot; online campaign &quot; is called the National leader Claudia Müller .
otherwise , green ball@@ asts look forward to track search for loc@@ als for loc@@ als under the holidays .

B@@ 27 @-@ Rehabilitation : host@@ els suffer from pl@@ umb@@ ing
at the speed , the B 27 is renovated , there is nothing to grin@@ d .
for the leaders of the construction work , begin at 5.@@ 30 in the morning , and only at 20 o &apos;clock , there are all@@ u@@ ed praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have made all quite slo@@ ppy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says El@@ vira T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the jet fuel station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super team .
there is no delay .
the construction site was scheduled to take place at the weekend of October to the half of October , until the end of October it will be ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blessed is also the removal of the persons responsible for the construction works , if it comes to the establishment of building operations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the construction site has been carried on Monday to the South and also the blocking of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen has been lifted and thus the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg has once again spread the traffic situation inside the place .
the citizens can now depart from O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 again on both sides .
the feed through the place seems to be returned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were partly significant complaints , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the manager responsible for the refurb@@ ishment responsible for the refurb@@ ishment responsible for the refurb@@ ishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the residents of Bach@@ ar road , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ n@@ erst@@ raße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many battles were sought and rather their Nav@@ i tru@@ sts as the sign@@ age .
what led to this truck in residential areas in residential areas .
as well , the speed lim@@ it@@ ments were not kept , the assembly called for the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ sing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were significant exceeding , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King who made himself home on the site itself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are already been inj@@ ected two to three per minute .
the quick@@ est part of the speed was on the Tempo @-@ 30 zone with 77 hour kilometres .
since the construction site has been moved , it is definitely a quiet .
for the business@@ men at the B 27 it is only a small comfort that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg to be open the road again .
in these maps , business@@ men will not hesitate .
but that the B 27 @-@ reconstruction has led to them at an increase in sales , every one that asks .
however some are more and some less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; who has less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so for other firms , it has hardly consequences for the renovation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thomas Sul@@ z talks a maximum of slight decline in the car from Mai@@ er , but also a clear that of course &quot; the lear@@ ance is missing . &quot;
on the most massive , the local restaurants are located along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly Crown , finds himself clear words .
that is already threat@@ ening .
not only him , but all hosts have &quot; hard hit . &quot;
there were missing the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ ak .
we must be happy about any Euro turnover .
the net sales grow to &quot; far above 50 percent . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road race took place &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; around two years &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
half of his employees have to put away .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and the half would have been dismissed , politics would have re@@ acted otherwise .
instead , President Jörg Schmidt on a request by G@@ öh@@ ner , whether there could be a financial compensation , the restaurant benef@@ ited from the benefits of the location at the B 27 . now , she must also have the dis@@ advantages that result through the restoration .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties , where something spacious handled .
in all cases , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will pass on .
after all , the family business has been located here since 17@@ 15 , he refers to the long history .
however , other regular guests are now able to understand less frequently due to the complicated traffic management .
if you &apos;re not able to ride , it is also beautiful .
by the end of the rehabilitation work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt .
despite the cr@@ ises with BSE and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner keeps the effects of the B 27 construction works to its clients for the biggest crisis that has experienced its guest house in its long history .
construction work is already brutal for six months .
in the name of the terror attack in laws there is constantly smoking .
after the latest attacks , the Minister of Interior de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now a thick security package .
but what has a Dul@@ ation status to do with terror ?
and what does the co@@ al@@ thy partner say to all that ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the Re@@ conc@@ iler .
all its proposals will be polit@@ ically acceptable , &quot; polit@@ ically Modi@@ fied , &quot; says the Federal Minister for the introduction of its new security code .
they demand un@@ demand .
other , going points would be discussed at first within the parties .
also I participated in it .
but as the Minister of the Interior , however , is located on results and in a re@@ cover@@ able con@@ sens@@ us &quot; within the coalition .
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère den@@ ounced a little time before he presents his conclusions for the security in the Republic .
but they now fall more extensive , but the more extensive .
a lot has already been announced , announced that a new security authority is to be encrypted to the un@@ lock communication , is not new .
also the fact that Germany needs to implement several EU specifications on passenger information and arms .
the call for more video surveillance and staff for security authorities is not sur@@ pris@@ ingly surprising .
in part to the part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère starts a second attempt for proposals to do so far with the SPD : he wants to recru@@ it sympath@@ izers for terror@@ ists and jihadists with double citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; they will be difficult to score points for the SPD , &quot; dre@@ amed of the CDU man .
it is still necessary to do so for reas@@ oning , and do not require any chances to participate in the coalition partner .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is also presenting a few new ideas .
they have partly in itself : it is planning a quick procedure for shi@@ fts and more ways to restri@@ ct people in front of deportation .
refugees who are targeted specifically in the country are to check their smartphone or make social media accounts for a security check .
for the past asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to worse some worse than now - about such a criminal off@@ ences or pione@@ ering their papers in order to destroy their identity .
some of them is political and copyright .
man@@ ches also works un@@ balanced and leaves any questions open .
and with some points - in un@@ equal treatment of commem@@ oration , for example , the question arises : what does this actually have to do with security and terror ?
yes , by Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the themes of refugees and terror .
but it is not possible to speak in reasons that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
there are also many people in view of the high number of refugees about security .
and things that people deep@@ ened the people , let not let him go out in election cycle times .
the inner safety is huge in the focus .
first the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the reliability is large .
and yes , there are election campaign .
Union and S@@ DP are increasingly on the subject of internal safety increasingly in position .
in the last days there went up between the two parties .
only a gar@@ den@@ ier dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then establishing a security cloud collection of some global Unions of the Interior , in which the Ress@@ ort@@ ch@@ efs is also demand a Bur@@ ka ban and a return of double citizenship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the exc@@ essive tones here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he doesn &apos;t stop from a return from the double pass .
we satisfied the discussion in Germany .
they are new to make sure that you are not meaning@@ ful .
and with a Bur@@ ka prohibition he had constitutional obj@@ ections .
whether his own package is un@@ constitutional at all corners , whether it is really &quot; reasonable &quot; is for the co@@ al@@ thy partner .
it &apos;s a lot in what the dispute could handle .
but the SPD was also trying to pro@@ filing the topic of internal safety .
&quot; &quot; &quot; part@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel first signs a careful call for talks and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to increase safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen is still going through .
despite diesel engines , the delivery time will advance worldwide .
but not in all markets it runs .
in the return reaction , there are host f@@ uss for a term .
Volkswagen starts selling deliveries in the second half of the year .
Europe &apos;s largest car park can increase the increase in performance despite the diesel technology thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ run markets .
but in July , the Core brand VW launched primarily in Western Europe and res@@ ili@@ ated the total sales like that in the D@@ ax .
the brand VW in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars sold 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
in the home market of Germany , deliveries abroad fell by almost a sixth .
brand @-@ driven CEO Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weaker figures from July , especially on two sales days less in Europe .
in some core markets , there have also been a change of sales in some core markets .
in addition to the situation in Turkey about the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote also imp@@ acted out of the EU , an spokes@@ woman .
in the U.S. , where the gas aff@@ air first es@@ cal@@ ated , also stands a min@@ us to be@@ ech .
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the affected house brand of Lower Saxony will continue to continue through the diesel engines : after the first seven months , only an extra@@ dition charge of 0.9 per cent to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles .
Group CEO Fred Kap@@ pler continued to increase sales growth from January to July .
Volkswagen sold 1.3 percent more vehicles worldwide , 5,@@ 904 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had manip@@ ulated with a software exhaust tests .
in Germany alone , VW calls around 2.5 million cars to upgrade to the workshops .
in the course of re@@ arm@@ ament , VW re@@ affir@@ med that the conversion of cars has no negative effects .
after upgrading the vehicles there are fuel consumption in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions , or engine performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the car body of the customer , after re@@ arm@@ ament a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dis@@ agree not from a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warranty as it was on Friday in corporate trips . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reason to legal host@@ ility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen granted its German customers now a guarantee for the diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would have been confirmed by the Federal Ministry of Transport for the past mon@@ day .
the Department of Transport was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has completed the conditions of my investig@@ ational Commission and the KBA customer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; variations of these are not accepted , &quot; by the Federal Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the Ministry .
VW has acquired the guarantee that in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions , or engine performance after re@@ arm@@ ament , no deteri@@ oration will take place and all the type approval of the vehicle will remain unchanged .
Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; guarantee &quot; but not as it was registered in corporate groups .
with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee Volkswagen is the possibility that customers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; provides for example a half year after re@@ arm@@ ament to a workshop - and this could lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , in the customer &apos;s interest , it is important to avoid that there is nothing to do with the Ab@@ g@@ ass@@ al to do nothing with the Ab@@ g@@ ass@@ al , to prevent incorrect warranty claims as it was called .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , VW uses the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund is demanded of rich savings banks - the second institute in Germany in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ban@@ quet Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is just about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on gi@@ ro@@ - or daily monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Association of German Ban@@ ks speaks of a single incident and does not see a signal : normal au@@ ster@@ ity would not be afraid to pay for their pig@@ gy penalty . &quot;
if banks pay money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , you have to pay a 0.4 percent penalty .
this charge requires Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate clients for deposits made more than 100,000 euros on gi@@ ro@@ - or daily monetary accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 will cost 400 Euro in the year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ski@@ pped 40 million euros , that could be withdrawn from one day to the others and could not be able to understand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they lie with me in the central bank account and create 0.4 percent cost , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the banking manager . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t lay up for every million 4000 Euro . &quot;
and now , the cost is continuing now according to the principle of procedure .
the cash is easy to lie in the saf@@ eties of Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank , would be much too dangerous : &quot; I have already experienced four crash@@ es , I don &apos;t even have the fifth ! , &quot; said the ban@@ ker .
most clients could have understanding and changes to other applications .
just a few walking to other banks .
the Co@@ operatives Association Bavaria declared : &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB caused considerable costs in all banks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they alone bear , be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically permanently not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their fees for credit card , credit cards or credit instructions .
with pen@@ alties for deposits from three million euros , the Thuring@@ ian People and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank Al@@ ten@@ burger land had made head@@ lines in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , Managing Director of the Bank Association , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t expect that private clients have to pay for deposits , in addition to the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks much too strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a cli@@ ent@@ ele that is a little more luxuri@@ ant &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a problem for a small bank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is free of charge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
founded in 1911 , the cooperative bank of G@@ mund has branch offices in Bad Wies@@ see , R@@ ott@@ ach @-@ E@@ ars , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
well @-@ known actors , athletes and entrepren@@ eurs .
there are currently no further banks known to the cooperative association Bavaria , &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst .
the President of the German National Federation and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ banks ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared the end of June : &quot; the threshold of neg@@ atives go to the neg@@ atives , is very high . &quot;
the competition is hard , and it dro@@ ves the emig@@ ration of An@@ leg@@ ern to the competition .
customers in Germany will not leave the same in the width .
Dest@@ ination tops : who actually buys vinyl records ?
lon@@ ely men to love middle age .
before joining the commentary part , in order to over@@ se@@ duce it under the pseud@@ onym Non@@ Al@@ le@@ ad@@ sam@@ pler @-@ age with har@@ sh surfaces , this statement will be derived from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the most important re@@ formation of sound plates do not want to welcome a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als , who want to welcome the re@@ im@@ itation of physical objects , but due to the Mid@@ life Nost@@ al@@ gia .
those who have recently bought a record are all fo@@ resi@@ ght according to the age between 45 and 54 .
indeed , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely fle@@ as group .
it is also no Hor@@ ses by ho@@ b@@ by@@ lers - it has a emotional meaning : older record players retain their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it alone ( 69 % vs 66 % ) .
but do the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
if this blog would be a message report in television , the camera would follow me while I walk in the midst of a busy street in S@@ oh@@ o , a modest food suit and wild gest@@ ure , before I stop my hands and some best tor@@ ial words like : &quot; so , let &apos;s throw us a closer look . &quot;
so , let &apos;s throw us a look .
even if the heart of So@@ H@@ os is slow to its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now filling the building in which once an independent seller had been resident - there is a hand@@ ful of fantastic record shops .
I would probably ask the camera &apos;s camera to switch the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to estimate its age and mind through observation .
Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , whom I follow from S@@ ister Ray ( data number : two young women , three men mean age ) into the Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data number : eight men middle age , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day for a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill a few hours .
is it a Collector , I ask ?
&quot; I guess &quot; I guess &quot; he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates .
this record plates , pictured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I &apos;m not followed after I ) , clo@@ the walls of his living room .
the reason why he owns such considerable number of albums and singles , is the outcome of its available income : it is now able to buy loads that he could not aff@@ ord to buy those who sold it when he was young and ple@@ a .
&quot; many things I buy , are from the late 60s , early 70s , which appeared , when I was 11 or 12 . things , where I thought something too young to buy them , &quot; says he .
he is true that those who purchase records are rather re@@ ver@@ ted and glad@@ ly spend time alone , and add : &quot; I smoke not and I drink not much .
this is my master .
We@@ z , 25 who works at S@@ ister Ray , believes that many customers that he hits the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
however , he also noticed a new wave of people who are affected by the Medi@@ enh@@ pe , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and have seen again to buy their old sheets again .
of the discussions that I have led , people usually have taken care of their collection during the period of 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their sheets sold to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records . &quot; he says .
that would explain the boom on annex@@ es of the revised sheet of a particular age .
but what about the alleged emotional significance of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds in a shop such as phon@@ ica to detect that the record business offers a soo@@ thing community of parables .
according to We@@ z , some of the older clients attended the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some record fans were overwhel@@ med by the digital world and would like to withdraw the stability of trusted record sleeves , return of objects , who can watch the happ@@ en@@ ings .
&quot; I think , sometimes it can be the col@@ t or owned material property as a kind of comfort , &quot; says We@@ z .
that is with me as a collectors and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to deal spiritu@@ ally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social worker ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a lot of staff from one record stack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey by IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who have bought a record they have not yet heard .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record players who never use it , while 7 % of those who purchase a plate , don &apos;t own record players .
at that time of the report , I would probably look very concerned , while I had a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations .
J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works with sounds of the Uni@@ verse ( Number of males : three men mean age ) has noticed a &quot; Trophy aspect of the Revi@@ val . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone just returned here and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no record players , but I would like to buy a radi@@ oh@@ ead sound top that I can put them to the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happen .
more productive , less instruments .
we have people who say : &quot; I have no record player . &quot;
those are younger people , not older , who just come to slowly .
F@@ opp , which has dedicated the sound level almost a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience , than I drain .
there are couples around 70 , tourists who do photos , teenagers and women &apos;s middle age .
even if the atmosphere is somewhat more relaxed than in the af@@ ore@@ mentioned stores - Wild Be@@ asts of the latest syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ i and sex@@ t@@ ruck@@ ter Pop rather than from experimental jazz is it good to see such a diversity in the customer .
none of them sees strange women , but n@@ urs@@ ing psych@@ matic trau@@ matic are difficult to determine if you stand for about 30 seconds long next to someone else .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been around for some minutes at the business and viewed the Vari@@ et@@ aker of the sheets available for sale .
it makes even more man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins bum@@ ps than a big buy .
they don &apos;t deser@@ ve a lot , therefore , it is not a real option , says it .
it costs too much .
it is easy to listen to music from a computer or to other way , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; they drives with a sweet sig@@ h .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it is really unique .
my last stop is a business that said that a new generation of record lovers is to have inspired : urban out@@ casts .
while I give the ticket to pattern je@@ ans @-@ Hot@@ p@@ ants , I observe a group of young teen@@ ager who group@@ ed for a moment of Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras , before a father and daughter is superior to buy a Cros@@ ley record players .
on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of sheets of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ eh@@ ouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a blend of contemporary music and classics which essential records for an average collection .
no one sees her - perhaps because they are only pure decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to deal with them .
it is pure &quot; plate art . &quot;
but considering that any attraction for these objects mean more money for the industry , and some clients could send to the depths So@@ H@@ os for more , there is nothing to compl@@ ain about .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , even the one that is most suitable for luxury objects like boards .
even if my research shows that the results of You@@ th@@ v vote , they leave , at least in record shops in S@@ oh@@ o , the large number of female collectors in the reality , shops and in On@@ line@@ for@@ ums exist un@@ taken into account .
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
they don &apos;t spend their Thursday morning with security not with pl@@ um@@ bles by record shops of Ber@@ wick Street and leaves through boards , while at the star@@ ing view of an un@@ secret , 30 @-@ year @-@ old fasc@@ ator avoi@@ ding women &apos;s shoul@@ ders nothing shr@@ ink over the shoul@@ ders of middle age .

French court re@@ jects on sever@@ ance of shops in the jung@@ le refugee camp
a French court rejected an offer of the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jung@@ le of Cal@@ ais , in which thousands of refugees live .
in case of a trial , the authorities argu@@ ed the authorities in Cal@@ ais that the state should be su@@ ck@@ led to 72 impro@@ vis@@ ing shops in which people sell within the warehouse , of cigarettes to Energ@@ y@@ drinks , sell , hair@@ dressing services , or tea for 50 cents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or easy meals for a few Euro in provisional restaurants .
the Cal@@ ais pre@@ fecture argu@@ ed that these places should be ri@@ pped down because they would be paid a parallel economy , that no taxes would be paid and the risk of fire and san@@ itation risk .
humanitarian groups distributed the dish that shops and restaurants are important as the free meals that are offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups , not enough food for growing numbers in the camp .
they also led out that the provisional shops and restaurants often have a lot and free meals for people in distress .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the exp@@ ulsion of people who operate 72 impro@@ vis@@ ing businesses , but dre@@ amed that the concerns of Cal@@ ais &quot; pre@@ fecture are absolutely no@@ c@@ able . &quot;
the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that the grocery stores , cafes and restaurants will play a lot more role than people who live in extremely pre@@ stige conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas of quiet meeting between refugees and volunteers offer .
one of the places that was threatened by defe@@ ats was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos;@@ Café des stock , which is a non @-@ profit and 200 meals a day , English and French lessons , as well as an advice on asylum procedures for the hundreds of protection needy , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0.000 people signed the petition to get the Kids &apos; Café .
in a letter to the Guardian &apos;s name it was said that the closure &quot; for these children were a cat@@ astrophe , of which the youngest is eight years old . &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement Trailer
Germany R@@ aser must be set to the next generation speed sensor : in different federal states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices are being tested particularly effective .
the fut@@ ur@@ istic @-@ acting En@@ forcement Trailer of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example on accidents where it would be dangerous for mobile measurement due to the police .
for example , on highway construction sites or to rehabil@@ it@@ ating bridges with a temporary traffic @-@ pin there are often no necessary infra@@ structures to provide a stationary leaf for compliance with the speed limit .
a durable mobile structure can be too dangerous or co@@ stly .
the En@@ forcement Trailer is aut@@ ark : his battery lasts five days , the data data is transmitted using a modem .
with laser measurement technology all vehicles can also be recorded simultaneously via several tracks .
variable speed lim@@ it@@ ments as well as the throughput times after time , riding strip and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in highly driven state , one can move the trailer according to manufacturer with every car with trailer hit@@ ch .
with that it is not easy to see , it is lowered in the measurement mode , so that the wheels in the mo@@ red and also van@@ ish the safe outer cover .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system protect the gl@@ itter in front of V@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and has now been used .
foreign authorities also car@@ es with the new technology : recently France has released 100 pieces after an order of 150 pieces last year .
great Britain brings silver in 7 @-@ star Rug@@ by , completing Fi@@ ji Master@@ class gold
the impressive performance of Great Britain in the 7 @-@ day Rug@@ by came in the final on Thursday evening at a rup@@ ted stop at the last hur@@ dle when they were defeated by 43 @-@ 7 in the De@@ od@@ oro stage here in Rio .
Fi@@ ji divided a master class in the handling , side @-@ step@@ ping , back of the line , line @-@ up and ro@@ ar strength to win gold - their first Olympic Medal of each color .
the defeat of the silver medal has failed to pass through the silver medal - Great Britain &apos;s fourth to that day - and they could definitely be proud of their efforts in which they struck New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the distinct defeat of the boat , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final day on the same day could fall back in the final .
but ir@@ respective of these , Fi@@ ji would have defeated a 15 @-@ man team in the form .
it could be for GB a consol@@ ation - but it will probably not be - that at least one Br@@ it will hang tomorrow a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben R@@ yan , former chef for England from Wimbledon .
GB had a difficult path behind him .
eight years ago , under R@@ yan , they lost every game with Adelaide Sev@@ ens .
they just lost one thing here .
this loop is we@@ ary , but the progress is astonishing .
Fi@@ ji started wonderful and left the attacks of GB@@ S from Sp@@ ass .
it felt like the Kapitän Tom Mitchell and Co. in Co . , when the World Series winners went down 5 @-@ 0 to the above , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au went up into the corner .
with another four minutes playing time Jerry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack out of the right corner , which he turned .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly gained the ball .
a little gate of Mitchell stop the mountain of Mann Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa in a third goal but it has only stopped Fi@@ ji .
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a placed a touch down in the right corner and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the revival and there was still about a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ v@@ ou convinces by a further weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB teams and stor@@ med up until the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it is so , when Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB still had been added .
so it is also .
GB led basic changes to half time through and closed the fi@@ ji@@ anic gap ... for the whole four minutes , which was good for the ratios of the first half @-@ time , until Joshua finished Tu@@ is@@ ova after a Br@@ illi@@ ant stop@@ play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan Norton launched an attempt on GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went long in favor of the South Africa , whose fans sang and dancing at the grand@@ stand .
it was not difficult to admire the game of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ze replaced the i @-@ dot with another attempt in the last seconds .
the P@@ ru@@ ff @-@ ön@@ te , when Fi@@ j@@ is re@@ arm@@ ed and destroyed , destroy them in the lawn .
earlier on the day Fi@@ ji Japan defeated 20 @-@ 5 in semi @-@ finals and the United Kingdom pushed South Africa into a tight sem@@ match match from the race - Great Britain conversion of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown launched the boat in the first half , but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive floor work and achieved a gate among the post in the second half .
a brilli@@ antly late Tac@@ kling by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of English 15 @-@ A@@ side teams , secured the winning - and thus the silver medal .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning by fight with cancer of the train@@ ers to rowing
there will be no emotional Gold as with these games and what will be called .
from the first r@@ ash to the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve that enters in history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning finding an additional meaning in its golden moment at Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even though it was only those who were sitting on the ru@@ der , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams was present always at the second Olympic champion in a row without tax reb@@ els , the first women in history of the British Sports , who made a scale of such a scale .
its domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all of their 3@@ 9,@@ ated un@@ conditional use , which is also exempl@@ ary .
what we see are two brilliant Athlet@@ es which slides over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ elling , which does not reflect the nature of the Tri@@ umph@@ al Tri@@ om@@ phe .
behind every gold in the rowing is a batt@@ al@@ ion of content helping to make the difference and it was no one useful than the trainer , who didn &apos;t know this day before 30 months ago , when he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said , he ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer , which is operational and they did .
if you don &apos;t do that , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a rather serious situation .
it &apos;s a little the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the Trio was lucky that he could begin in early 2014 , out of season , could begin the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , if it is the right term under such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to get better again soon .
it was a inc@@ en@@ tive .
I was in hospital and ran on station around - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet to a time when they said that some steps would be enough .
this is how it begins .
rowing is already a challenge , but this makes it a bigger one .
in the in@@ fertil@@ ity of the victory , their first thoughts went to Williams , who had a ner@@ stri@@ ped morning with a little more than anything else and trying to process his own fears .
St@@ anning who was the cent@@ ur@@ ion at the Royal Art@@ illery Reg@@ iment in Afghanistan , said &quot; I was this week an emotional wreck . that &apos;s maybe something extremely , but it means so much . &quot;
it is only repeated that how much I and Helen and also did Robin have worked .
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin , we are nobody , therefore a massive thanks to him . he is the best coach in the world .
I would not have a better person for train@@ ers or a better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have lost no races in the last five years .
the pair had a hard rhythm , with which their opponents could not keep up .
even during the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark they had caught up , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had much in reserve .
we were tra@@ pped at the moment .
Helen : &quot; lead in the process , lasting in process . &quot;
it is really important to get rid of it .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not able to make something rab@@ ies .
we wanted to make no fire@@ works today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race what we did .
the pair will take a break for a year before it will make decisions concerning his future .
Glo@@ ver has to appear next week on a wedding in their own with the TV advent@@ ur@@ ers Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that my last race was .
that would have much more pressure .
in London , it took about six months to realize that I &apos;m an Olympic Champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
that feels so much better , &quot; she said .

affili@@ ates are the municipalities church loud , Breit@@ brun@@ n , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
there are water supply agreements for further cities and municipalities .
the current president , Breit@@ brun@@ n Mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was discontinued in 1985 as a water@@ keeper and was appointed Chief Executive Officer in 1988 .
&quot; its tasks are very varied and they have been extended from the water @-@ line construction and maintenance work on office and organis@@ ational activities , the budget , calculation of fees and contributions at weekends , &quot; said the chairman .
as an outstanding events , she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , land in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) , the re@@ creation of a central computer controller ( 1999 ) , the new creation of a central computer controller ( 2004 ) and the renew@@ ing of water lines .

he is the best water and he was a faithful press .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as a highlights from his point of view he called the well @-@ structure and the restructuring of the festival .
the biggest challenge and the most difficult application was the pi@@ ping at the plateau at church in a loud 3rd January .
here , at minus 17 degrees the whole night had to pass through , so the villages could be supplied with water .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man called on us and given to have shot his life on his life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one police woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ rator shall be on the run according to him in public .
meanwhile nationwide , Sven S. could be on the road by car .
the man is about 1.80 m tall , mus@@ cular , bra@@ i@@ ously burned and has a gl@@ at@@ ze .
meanwhile , the police released a photo of him .
however , it is a few years old .
meanwhile the man has a smoo@@ ther .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still bear the weapon , so the police .
if you see Sven S. , the 110 will call .
the police speaks of a &quot; relationship tool . &quot;
the victims was born in 1988 , the perpet@@ rators in 1981 .
the competent police in Lübeck initially wanted to make no data for the ts@@ ather@@ finish or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims , but they confirmed that a man had been killed .
&quot; it is a s@@ coff@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more , we don &apos;t say &quot; more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the police player in Lübeck . &quot; &quot; &quot;

steel - light view for German steel industry
the cr@@ ushed and energet@@ ic German steel industry remains spar@@ ed by additional costs in millions of millions .
financial burden , which threatened the industry from the econom@@ ies promotion , are from the table .
it remains for the liberation of renewable energies with the existing resources for the so @-@ called self @-@ energy production in the German steel industry , the Federal Minister for Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West German General newspaper &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) .
&quot; I &apos;m really happy that we finally could reach the negotiations after two years . &quot;
according to the European Commission , the European Commission had therefore planned to use steel manufacturers to use the gases from the high @-@ furnace electricity generation for their own consumption .
the steel industry threatened an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year according to the German industry association .
Gabriel told the WA@@ Z , it is now a primary certificate with the EU Commission for discussions with competition Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when generators in steel structures will be replaced , all an EEG conversion from 20 percent .
but this will not be raised in the steel industry .
Germany &apos;s IG Metall sal@@ uted the unification of Germany with the EU Commission for their own power .
thus the status Quo was able to largely consoli@@ date the previous control .
special meaning has the successful colours of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stahl &apos;s Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; further must follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also at the reform of emission rights , climate and employment targets are considering &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated IG Metall @-@ boss Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering under over@@ capacity and substantial price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008 .
last year , the situation continued to continue to be the world &apos;s largest producer in China in view of the weaker demand of steel on the global market .
European manufacturers throw off Chinese steel companies price d@@ umping .
over the course of this spring the situation has somewhat relaxed .
for a show , import duties on imported effects , other economic prospects take place in China .
it is clear how sustainable the price rest@@ oring is .
the German industry prim@@ us Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp remained careful on Thursday .
recently the prices would have stag@@ n@@ ated again .
the industry re@@ acts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp didn &apos;t want to exclu@@ de lock@@ ers of individual works .
in the German steel industry , around 86@@ ,000 people were employed at the end of 2015 .
in July , German steel producers remain careful in spite of increasing prices and increasing orders .
they produce more than 3.4 million tons , and six percent less cru@@ de steel than in the previous year , as the Economic unification of steel over@@ took place on Friday .
after a brief increase in May , the produced amount will now return the second month in a row .
since the beginning of the year , production is reduced by two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
the association anticip@@ ates the increasing order situation in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation .
fellowship , spirit , health : singing , Sen@@ iors
the S@@ ingen has accompanied all her life , as young girls , she was a young woman in the school choir , in teaching studied music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a senior choir .
&quot; sing - emotional and physically , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , che@@ er@@ ful and more lively , she says .
she is doing something very well with her health and her spirit .
for singing is equal to several perspectives a great hobby for seniors , says Erhard Hac@@ kler from the German veter@@ in@@ league .
most Sen@@ iors sing in choir and share the joy of music , describes Hac@@ kler .
ir@@ regular and nour@@ ishing social contacts can establish and maintain .
for often , social and family structures aver@@ aged up , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
this experience has also done Ur@@ sel K@@ Tip in their ch@@ orus : &quot; they will be able to arrange and to organize himself on the others and learn each other - a choir is a very special form of consciousness . &quot;
singing can be difficult in the positive sense , Hac@@ kler has to sing .
for thereby , seniors have a deep and controlled breathing .
those who calls his lung regularly , is not so fast in everyday life as fast as the d@@ ost .
even though it goes to sound the sound of the voice at the age , singing is an optimal hobby .
on older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , Urs@@ ula L@@ enz says from the federal labour community of senior citizens .
in the older generations , the common rings had a lot higher point , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and leisure time , explains them .
L@@ enz often noticed that singing or listening of songs in elderly people often we@@ ens many memories , often associated with positive feelings of her youth .
by song lyrics and especially melodies , themselves de@@ men@@ ill people in a long @-@ standing events .
in addition to the singing , a special achievement is demanded , L@@ enz explains .
at the same time they focus on their own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to other singers - this is a major cogn@@ itive challenge .
just older people who live alone , do not only focus on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition which you started through the singing in ch@@ orus , Hac@@ kler list@@ ened .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ est@@ e@@ em is also growing by singing in ch@@ orus .
itself to show yourself : if I do long for something , I will better and watch over me - this experience is strengthening .
good reasons to start with singing , so there &apos;s enough .
if he wants to try a new hobby , it should not hesitate - even if he believes that little talent , L@@ enz is .
you can &apos;t sing only - at 50 sing people who hears it , if a tone goes next to it ?
in search of the suitable offer , senior citizens have different possibilities , says Hac@@ kler .
if anyone sings from the friend of a veter@@ an circle , you can easily connect it .
many of the towns also offer views over the choirs in the surroundings .
if you want to sing in a church choir , it can turn right to the church or the church .
many senior citizens can also be found on the Internet .
if anyone has access to the internet , the family , friends or neigh@@ bors can ask help with the Internet account .
who desire to sing , should connect to a ch@@ orus , at Hac@@ ienda Hac@@ kler .
singing does the soul well and has something fun - this is true for every age .
cats react lou@@ si@@ bler as tom@@ cat on excav@@ ation of young animals
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover , what effect the ro@@ ses of Kat@@ zen@@ bab@@ ys has grown on adult animals .
in her surprise the Mi@@ th@@ aw also did not eat the male - however , they remained in the difference to the females always .
female cats may recognize the ar@@ ous@@ ands of cat bab@@ ys at the r@@ th@@ aw of the little ones .
they react 10 percent faster on the k@@ itt@@ ens of k@@ itt@@ ens who selected in great need such as scientists from the Medical School and Medical School of Hannover ( MH@@ H ) .
cr@@ ater also react to the ri@@ fe of k@@ itt@@ ens , but still equal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the acoustic differences between the r@@ th@@ aw of less and strongly @-@ rainy young for the males are either perc@@ ep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ olog@@ in Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from the MH@@ H . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the initial unit of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ u@@ de Biology &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a previous examination , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of k@@ itt@@ ens with the courtesy of their help is different .
a total of nine adult cr@@ ater and eight cou@@ ches were observed from the seal of the MH@@ H .
they were played for a ru@@ dder of little ones that were taken for three minutes from the saus@@ age and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand they were con@@ fron@@ ted with cry of stronger co@@ bs which were lifted in addition .
the researchers keep their results despite the low sample for sa@@ wing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every female , even those who had no own offspring , re@@ acted to the cry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she turned faster to the speakers if this ri@@ fe played the very rainy kit@@ ten .
this ability may be borne , or what is sexually mature with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the male respon@@ ds at all , &quot; said the bi@@ olog@@ in .
in the past scientists have already examined several times during the people the reactions of women and men on baby care .
some studies showed that women were sensitive to infants , as they were already mothers , or did not , reported the Bi@@ olog@@ in Marina Sche@@ ung@@ ann .

after the pre @-@ round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; Lion &quot; came early in the Europe League early .
in the South of Li@@ g it was only given to rank 6 .
the season was not good .
the Trophy was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we made it and this is the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as the year was better .
above all , thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who ended with 26 seasonal figures as a sweet@@ per @-@ li@@ g @-@ go@@ os@@ en@@ nig the basis for the 14th title .
this is the reason that the fans are looking forward to returning to the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
at the end of the AC , the AC , taking part under the contract and in Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as only l@@ ent to the coup attempt , did not exp@@ ire after the political situation in the country after his EM holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he must only say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ icker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; club@@ son F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

D@@ oping : these athletes still have medals in Olympics in Rio
the 34 year old Just@@ in Gat@@ lin was closed twice for d@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ owa cannot start in Rio .
other over@@ led Athlet@@ ics sinners can only laugh - they fight in Rio for medals .
the topic d@@ oping is determined after the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics in 2012 .
the rus@@ sian s@@ wimm@@ ers Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ owa , who had ended up after a d@@ oping lock in just before the games , was brought out with their start ( 100 meters of chest ) fl@@ aw@@ ed and hat@@ ch .
it was a sk@@ ur@@ r@@ ile Sz@@ ener@@ ie : with a raised smile , she was still proud in the hall and prov@@ oked it with their appearance .
when it was fixed that they won &apos;t collect gold , the audience broke out into a J@@ ub@@ el@@ storm .
but there are numerous other athletes competing with D@@ oping past at the Rio Olympics in spite of the d@@ oping past .
here an overview :
Just@@ in Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 m @-@ season / USA ) : the 34 year old belongs to the en@@ um@@ erable figures in the athlet@@ ics stadium .
he was closed for two times due to d@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
the Olympic Champion of 2004 and Ex @-@ world champion runs even faster than before , and is more than 100 m in 9,@@ 80 seconds , the number one in the world and is regarded as the largest challenge of Uz@@ ain Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic teacher and seven @-@ fold world champion had to sit a six @-@ month spar@@ row after you intake the pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .

Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Dis@@ cus / Croatia ) : 2011 was the winner of the 2012 Olympic Champion in 2012 and the European champion in 2013 and the European champion in meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amin from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ kovic denied the ignor@@ ant intake and was closed for six months .
the four most broad@@ est lit@@ ters in this year go to the account of the big gold f@@ ogging .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 m @-@ season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic Champion and a two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , was positi@@ vely tested in 2010 and has been closed for 21 months .
an average for penis enlargement is responsible , informed Mer@@ ritt .
this year the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is about 200 and 400 metres from the world &apos;s fastest men in the world .
I@@ wan Ti@@ ch@@ on ( Hammer@@ throw , Belarus ) : probably hardly a athletes were detected as many medals .
so Ti@@ ch@@ on lost its World Cup title of 2005 nine years later , after testing test@@ osterone d@@ oping was found .
the meanwhile 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to leave Olympia @-@ Silver in 2004 because of ster@@ oid arthritis and the EM @-@ title in 2006 because of test@@ osterone abuse .
he also received Bron@@ z@@ em@@ ed@@ aille of the 2008 Olympic Games returning to the CA@@ S International Tribunal for the 2008 Olympic Games .
at 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m he ranked fifth in the world list .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world records and gold f@@ avo@@ ids was only tested in May , but may not start in Rio .
at the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , hin@@ ts on taking a banned food supplements , the sperm of the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency WA@@ DA fell mild and ran already on July 13 .
pir@@ ates error in Thailand - Austri@@ ans viol@@ ated - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand stand with the woman in contact , said the spokes@@ person for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas B@@ öll , Friday early .
I had suffered chi@@ ves and have been treated in the hospital , but I have already left this already .
her hom@@ ebo@@ und journey is planned for the beginning of September .
whether from the other explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ u@@ ket , as well as in the southern towns of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ phe , are also still un@@ clear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stand on permanent contact with local authorities , so B@@ öll .
at approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok Hu@@ a H@@ in , initially , Hu@@ a H@@ in were initially explo@@ ded on the evening of two bombs .
according to the police , the police have been killed in Thailand and killed approximately 20 people , among them the Austrian , three German , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
during Friday early Friday , two jumps went up , and a certain man was killed , according to the authorities .
in the morning a bomb det@@ onation was also reported in the morning .
in the Det@@ onation of the popular seaside resort Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured following police information .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , at the south @-@ east coast of the country then another bomb explo@@ ded by a city of urban employees .
according to the authorities in a flower case , the demol@@ ition rate went into air in front of the Re@@ place of coastal police in the air .
after the still called Det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g at the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ om@@ on , at the south @-@ eastern coast , several injured .
in connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was named .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bomb attacks bear the same manuscript , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said army staff Dan@@ ai Crit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday early in front of journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect it is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to split up to possible mot@@ ives - probably the actions of Muslim reb@@ els .
also Thai media wanted to recognize a pattern in the attacks of the country , which is typical for the bombing of a Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
in contrast , the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attack would not be related to Islam@@ ist movement or with international terrorism .
&quot; this is only local sabot@@ age , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said one speaker in Bangkok .
it is estimated that the bombs were laid by the ruling military j@@ unta .
the authorities have been confi@@ denti@@ fied confi@@ denti@@ ally to the coming attacks in the South of the country - however , they cannot be informed about the exact time and places .
it is yet un@@ clear that group should be behind the attacks .
the police ret@@ ains its civil servants throughout the country , security around important government buildings as well as airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and am@@ us@@ al area .
in Thailand it is always smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but they usually do not judge for tourists .
Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that has been used by King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j in Hu@@ a H@@ in .
according to the well @-@ wide bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to make the instructions for the Thai Security Auth@@ orities .
high security risk ( level 3 ) sailed for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ iw@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and its surroundings .
according to disp@@ utes between safety and Muslim populations , they are not necessary to travel into these provinces .
increased safety risk ( security level 2 ) sailed for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were a few days following a controversi@@ al referendum on a constitution of the military j@@ unta .
this dream has no effect to the military in the coming years .
Jun@@ ta chief and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ CH@@ A said , the bombs were an attempt to pin chaos during the country toward stability , an improvement of economic situation and tourism .
the military j@@ unta , which had taken in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest the power had taken hold on itself , keeping the kingdom return to stability and order .
however , it has not been succeeded to get the military in the utter@@ most parts of the country for years in the extreme south of the country .
more than 6,@@ 500 people were killed in the conflict .
almost one year ago , in Bangkok , we were killed in Bangkok at a popular Hin@@ du @-@ Sh@@ purely 20 people - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloody attack of the country &apos;s younger history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is due to the vis@@ or of the federal government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after several coun@@ ties , the constitutional protection was also under observation under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ident@@ ity Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; points for taxation of the Free democratic principle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said constitutional protection Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate the German press agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , contrary to other Islamic faith , or from the Middle East into extrem@@ ist way , diff@@ use .
therefore we observe the movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group of French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is turned against &quot; Multi@@ k@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn &apos; , &quot; un@@ controlled mass migration , &quot; and the &quot; loss of own identity by foreign language . &quot;
constitutional protection in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thuring@@ ia - watch the &quot; ident@@ ities &quot; already .
in the decision , Ma@@ ate said that his authority have voted closely to the state &apos;s decision .
&quot; groups like the &apos; Ident@@ ity movement &apos; try to pick up their target group as it is , &quot; said the constitutional system .
generally , try extrem@@ ist , with you@@ thful righteous language , often with p@@ opp@@ iger music .
the Islam@@ ist Islam@@ ists as well as legal gu@@ ards .
this is no extra advertising for the own thing .
the prop@@ aganda should appeal to the people .
young people are sus@@ cep@@ tible to this particular way .
this is dangerous .
last from several states there had been reports on contacts of the &quot; ident@@ ities &quot; to Af@@ D policy .
Ma@@ ate said , he had no knowledge .
for the constitutional protection the possible contacts of this species only relevant from a certain point .
it comes to whether the relevant party - in this case the Af@@ D - through certain people who are fighting extrem@@ ist , changes their target direction and will be as extrem@@ ist .
thus , whether such persons , the influence of the party is crucial to the party .
this is not visible .
with a view of the significant increase in right @-@ time criminal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and Refu@@ gee , Ma@@ ate did not speak in this context not from new terrorism .
but we &apos;ve found in recent years that it can give right th@@ iev@@ es structures .
it was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Friday group .
it may well be that further right @-@ terrorism groups or small groups form the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee camps or attacks from other right @-@ wing mot@@ ives .
but a German @-@ wide or Europe @-@ wide control of sp@@ inal ror@@ ism is not recogni@@ z@@ able .
the existing groups were created on regional level or social networks .
concerned , Ma@@ ate expressed that many over@@ stor@@ ms went to the account of people who had previously appeared in the right scene in the scene before .
this is the best ar@@ ous@@ ed .
many of the susp@@ ects in attacks on asylum seek@@ ers are not known as crimin@@ als , polit@@ ically motiv@@ ated offen@@ ders or supporters of the right scene .
&quot; many people have committed criminal off@@ ences , who were previously treated with legal gu@@ ards , who were perhaps polit@@ ically in@@ different , or for example CDU , SPD or Lin@@ ke , who decided to become radical in the right of right @-@ wing vote . &quot;

his time , he stopped only at a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters fre@@ estyle , played there any role .

in the future , who will continue to continue the market research company , it is still un@@ clear .
in An@@ le@@ ad@@ minister , it was on Friday , with the shareholders , last@@ ly the dis@@ appointment over the further continuing success of the re@@ structured restructuring of years ago .
Mr. Hartmann has been at GfK @-@ tip since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fruits of re@@ struc@@ tur@@ ers are not yet to see after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was named it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the most recently bad GfK and business figures , each share of shareholders will eventually become un@@ quiet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if that at BMW had the case , this would also be the Qu@@ and@@ ts &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; was named it . &quot; &quot; &quot;

crash@@ es - bus sli@@ p@@ ly in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ so@@ n in tr@@ ench : eight injured
at an accident of a coach with 43 senior guests as driving guests , eight people were injured on Thursday at Kr@@ um@@ m@@ audi@@ n ( Landkreis Aur@@ ich ) .
two of the occup@@ ants suffered severe injury , divided the police .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old chassis of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to leave their data according to the opposite L@@ aster , which went part on the return journey .
the bus came to the right from the road and sli@@ pped into a tr@@ ench , like a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the location of the bus could not leave the bus independently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire brig@@ ade freed the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ance trucks and an emergency department came to the fall of the state road 2 .
the last traveler were brought back by a liner bus to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ audi@@ ner district of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a spare drive of the travel company .
the investigations called on the load drivers and possible witnesses to report to the police .
the fees per cubic meters of wast@@ ew@@ ater will amount to € 2.@@ 10 for the area of wast@@ ew@@ ater plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3.@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2,@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2,@@ 18 euros ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the wast@@ ew@@ age fee will be increased once again , if required improvement measures are necessary .
after the prev@@ ailing lim@@ ulation the waste price in Az@@ endorf will be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported in the approval of the budget by the governor with Kul@@ mb@@ ach that are running for these se@@ wage plants .
the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the cost @-@ to @-@ operate systems due to legal basis .
as of October 1 , 2016 , citizens and industrial companies from Wel@@ z@@ ards , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to attack deeper into the pur@@ se .
the increased increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as Chairman of the Administ@@ rative Director Herbert Schmidt , a new cal@@ ulation of charges for se@@ wage plants of the market community was necessary .
in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , overseas and national covers from the previous calendar period will be compens@@ ated .
with all three san@@ itation systems founded , Schmidt thus founded the gra@@ dients of relatively small establishments with a very low @-@ san@@ itation , which fly between 6@@ 800 and 12000 cubic meters per year .
due to the low distribution basis , for example , expenses for the necessary repairs of several thousand Euros would be gra@@ vely gra@@ vely charged .
Moreover , waste water is slightly down@@ wards in all three plants .
in the past calendar period in all three systems not least due to their age of san@@ itation and repair expend@@ itures were incur@@ red in a considerable extent .
the plant in Az@@ endorf was nearly 30 years old , the plants for World Bank , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth and Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years .
in the se@@ wer@@ age , Schmidt re@@ proved that the mechanical aer@@ ating system had to be exchanged in the se@@ wage plant in Az@@ endorf .
in the p@@ umping station space , the nearly 20 years old conveyor systems had to be over@@ taken from the ground and in the pond area L@@ opp had to be used for nearly 20 years , the sep@@ tic mud provides and an additional ventilation option had to be installed in order to maintain the water regulations in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these extraordinary expenses , the response and maintenance costs came into account according to the new calendar period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs which amounted to significantly lower than the current level in 2011 / 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; stone houses clearly shows that with the small wast@@ age in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was fully wound . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thereby , Schmidt moved to the market leader of great entertainment costs for se@@ wer@@ age in the past 20 years .
the situation for the af@@ ore@@ mentioned facilities will continue to remain pre@@ emin@@ ent after view of stone cottages , especially since one could not expand the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ acht@@ al area to expand these systems because it is about de@@ struc@@ tive institutions .

all ab@@ sten@@ tions will be presented to the public .
the Snap@@ chat filter have caused criticism of the past in which they accused that the app Black@@ face convey@@ s or white skin as a beauty deal .
when this week failed to pre @-@ beat a filter , who gave them sl@@ otted , false teeth and dis@@ closed p@@ liers , they called some critics of a rac@@ ist cartoon by Asi@@ ans .
they asked if these repeated contro@@ vers@@ y has a larger problem , that the company has di@@ spar@@ ity with di@@ vers@@ ity .
the news and the indig@@ nation were spread on Wednesday wide , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Motherboard , one day after Snap@@ chat , that it would have been de@@ activated .
the company offered an exc@@ use : the filter was originally intended as a tribute to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but the standing , the R@@ ass@@ is@@ sm@@ us experienced , remin@@ is@@ cent of the in@@ viol@@ ating cl@@ ut@@ ees .
others turned to the anim@@ e comparison .
in an e @-@ mail she wrote Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean American Art student whose no@@ ises were widespread over the photos that the filter &quot; viol@@ ently and was very pleasant . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to ar@@ gue with the counter@@ point of a very rebel@@ li@@ fied Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that the filter is not yel@@ low@@ ly approved , but that the yel@@ low@@ ance is pulled into the extreme environment .
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless di@@ vers@@ y and integration program , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we keep all in the hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats large audience young people - that in the race of biodiversity as their older out@@ players - could not expect to expect Sen@@ si@@ vity .
when one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters a picture creates , &quot; so it is much more difficult for a user , &quot; it is much more difficult to see when it was the case , &quot; the 25 year old K@@ atie Zh@@ u said in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday Zh@@ u decided that as a product manager and engineer for medium , Zh@@ u decided to delete her Snap@@ chat account , and promp@@ ted others to do it .
in an account for medium and in a telephone interview they said that they believe that a cash @-@ related contro@@ vers@@ y is reflected in the lack of practices on Snap@@ chat .
Zh@@ u critic@@ ised the big part of white , only male leadership and finishing its debut with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors , so that they can meet such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Zh@@ u , &quot; or they are people with other skin colors that are working there , but not in positions in which they feel safe and feel good to say &quot; . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that the Snap@@ chat has not left un@@ answered .
the company has no figures for the diversity of its workforce and has its status as a private enterprise .
on Thursday , the Snap@@ chat on Thursday decided to discuss the cultural back@@ grounds of its staff , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company has recently appointed a staff member who focused on entrepren@@ eur@@ ial population groups and on internal inclusion .
Zh@@ u said that she will need her Snap@@ chat account , and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it is not O.@@ K. &quot; . &quot;
military leadership of IS@@ IS secret service information , committee the Congress of Congress
military members of the United States Central Command changed policy information to record a optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than it had allowed the real conditions on site in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can Members of the Defence Forces , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction under Central Command Secret Services , reported how pre@@ set their in@@ estim@@ ations to the American efforts towards the Islamic State .
central Command , shortly C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida to controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; news service information that were typically reported by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com Commander for terrorism than it had allowed to test the real conditions on site and have been consistently positive than analyses of other news services , &quot; quoted a newspaper article in the report .
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses will be presented with our political leaders , &quot; presented Ken Cal@@ ver@@ t , Republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives .
the management error occurred in Cent@@ Com up to the top level of the organization .
the ten page report presents detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in education of the Iraqi Armed Forces .
although there is no direct hin@@ ts that government peaks are given under Obama to change reports , it shows how anal@@ ysts predi@@ ct the pressure from their pre @-@ laws , an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or I@@ si@@ l .
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command Press releases , opinions and statements before the congress were clearly positive than the facts . &quot;
for example , Cent@@ Com families announced that a military recovery can begin in April or May 2015 .
in the second largest city of Iraq , Mos@@ ul , the second largest city of Iraq remains under control of the Islamic State .
&quot; after months of investigations , it is as much clear . &quot; Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Congress held from Kansas , in an opinion .
from the middle of the year 2014 to the middle of the year 2015 , the tips of Central Command changed the following reports to download the risk of IS@@ IS in Iraq .
rep@@ ublic@@ ans called the Task Force to the life after being added that anal@@ ysts wor@@ ried about manip@@ ulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed in@@ sights during the investigations .
in addition to Cent@@ Com Reports of Cent@@ Com Reports by the General Assembly of the Ministry of Defense in G@@ ange .
the Democratic Members of the News Services Committee published their own findings with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 Cent@@ Com created a revised process for the creation of post @-@ service ass@@ ess@@ ments to I@@ si@@ l and the Iraqi security services , &quot; gave the highest ranking democratic Council in the com@@ rade , member of the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. Schiff .
this process , as Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the publication of downstream reports , &quot; the Mor@@ al among anal@@ ysts &quot; and &quot; gave exc@@ essi@@ vely little space for different opinions . &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and Democrats announced that there were no evidence on a intervention of the White House at Cent@@ Com anal@@ ysts &apos; in a particular political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the congress were published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
in August , the New York Times reported investigations by investig@@ ators by the General Assembly of the Pentagon , who were added after complaints of Cent@@ Com anal@@ ysts .
Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a press brie@@ cher of the Pentagon , gave no report that the Ministry of Defence would have no report on Congress while investig@@ ating the investigation of the general spec@@ imes .
but he also announced that &quot; experts at times definitely have di@@ versi@@ fied opinions concerning the interpretation of more complex data , and that the Ministry of Defence welcomed a controversi@@ al discussion of this important topic of national defense . &quot;
the investigations have caused the question of a successful aviation campaign under the American leadership of Iraq and Syria ( a asser@@ tion which is now made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
however , the alleg@@ ations of last year however , however , President Obama can rely on the Central Command for hon@@ est ass@@ ess@@ ments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya , and other crisis regions .
the criticism of related information about the Islamic State recall the outcome of more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , a letter about the recommendations of many anal@@ ysts only saw a small occupying troops in Iraq and had a little time on it to make the consequences of the invasion of 2003 thoughts .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker played a key role in the insur@@ rection against the present coverage of the Islamic State .
last year , the team is convinced by Mr. Hoo@@ ker on indication of government agencies , having received no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , since this impro@@ vis@@ ing refin@@ eries have been put into operation in order to sell oil on the Black@@ market .
however , this knowledge was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ized by members of the legisl@@ ature because of his superior positive assessment of the war , at a hearing before the Senate .
General Austin went into retirement in April and was replaced at the Central Command through Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the USA winning fourth match in the field hockey of women , a show@@ down with great Britain is before
one day after they had shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American field ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the US was won with 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually show a memor@@ able performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said it could not remember that ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their doors in memory .
however , this was however , however : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are the same in their group with the British in the first place , who remained unbe@@ aten in Japan after their 2 @-@ 0 victory .
great Britain and the United States will meet their first round on Saturday in the last game .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ final , the game will decide what the two will get to the first and second place within their group .
the first @-@ placed team will leave a little bit longer in the way that the other group lead to the other .
as always the game is going to go out , the Americans are triggered by their success story a surprising host , four years after she landed with the last London Games in the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time at the age of three years ( her two older sisters played the sports at Dre@@ xel University ) , at 16 years she became a national player in the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
it missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 as they could not qualify for the spre@@ ader .
then came the year 2012 , in which for her and her team went all shooting .
in the following year Craig Par@@ n@@ ham became an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the N@@ ation@@ alt@@ e@@ ams and thus began to turn the things to better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical transition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we did not have the work of work in London , which we now have .
we can completely rip the rowing completely .
on Thursday evening he opened the cake in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the close range .
India was gone without victory in the tournament , but the team was sur@@ pris@@ ingly tough , and holding the player from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until he took the game into their hands .
it took a spr@@ int with the sh@@ allow ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved to the middle and lu@@ cr@@ ates the ball in the gate around the US a 2 @-@ 0 lead to pro@@ cure .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the Tor@@ beware of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had previously had to book one goal in each of the previous games .
she has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the result of the next game on Saturday .
am@@ id@@ st the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the tramp@@ ol@@ ines
wherever you are , too late as it is , it &apos;s the Olympic Games .
the events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly and in@@ ev@@ itable , a ras@@ cal relay between competition and str@@ uts .
it is , when the Olympic tor@@ ch itself would have a burning rod , which is served by the wrist@@ s to the swimming pool for tri@@ athletes .
you cannot listen to the TV , a newspaper read or listen to the talk of your neigh@@ bors inside the Coff@@ es@@ hop , without talking with Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the battle between Michael Ph@@ el@@ ps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there are still Logan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a Frauen@@ W with dim@@ pl@@ ets , could be well known among these known names , who can be sent to Prime Time , by sponsors and well @-@ being TV advertising when he would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , Turner or even F@@ real .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fighting in the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines around gold .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
further from the centre , some in the shade are the sports fields that are not commonly accepted : air guns shoot , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ w@@ ondo .
we will always have the chest swimming and may have dominion long .
but if I do not make arguments for my particular lovers , then leave the attention to the dis@@ crete charm of the tramp@@ ol@@ ines .
although the tramp@@ ol@@ ines already has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had made his debut in Sydney , it was the last 16 years so many that I had asked , not knowing that it is an Olympic Port .
this could also be regional Ig@@ nor@@ ance .
although the USA sent athletes for competition , it has never won a medal in the tramp@@ ol@@ ines and had a athl@@ ete up until 2012 , who made it up to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prizes for the men and the Chinese and the Canadian women to share for women .
Dong Dong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ an from Canada will defend their Gold Medal from London this year .
the tr@@ ol@@ ad jump has a certain outer side char@@ me , in part because it sounds suited for a C@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ schule as the ideal for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should ad@@ mit that I am not an expert , but only a d@@ geb@@ unden@@ er enthusi@@ ast .
it has hum@@ orous potential - the cart@@ ographic trem@@ bling of its never to end - but also the Gra@@ zie of the gy@@ ms and Tau@@ ri , the two sports , which combines it essentially .
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means as much as &quot; trampoline . &quot;
stre@@ ak winner jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot nearly up to 30 feet into the air and must move a number of falling mot@@ ions ( turning , dumb@@ bell and sal@@ tos ) before it landing at the feet .
they will be evaluated according to official Olympi@@ ads after execution , difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot;
two @-@ year @-@ standing athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio each other .
the joint Olympic V@@ ektor is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts in their stre@@ ches after gold further , qu@@ icker , down@@ wards and beyond , sometimes to the finish , sometimes back and back , down@@ wards and down on the playground .
you will not only hunt the finish line or the base wall , but also a further cave target : the world or the Olympi@@ ad .
the goal oriented stre@@ aks is the Nobel , ad@@ mi@@ red , even fan@@ atic , and it &apos;s enough to stir even a viewer to tears .
but it &apos;s also what I am watching while watching this games as something tired .
the trampoline offers a re@@ pri@@ eve .
the v@@ ector of the tramp@@ ol@@ ines is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she push@@ es off , seem@@ ingly he@@ avi@@ est like an ast@@ ron@@ aut , goes down@@ wards , then down to the top , then back then back .
there is also a contest , of course not without difficulty , but during practice there is no hec@@ tic attack on the finish , no wol@@ ves in the distance , just the dreams , elegant repe@@ aling time and gravity .
it is so Zen as a contest for the Olympic Games can only be .
the quali@@ fications and du@@ cks of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.00 .
N@@ BC will broadcast the final round as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00 .
in the midst of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ie they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that will probably see in general tum@@ ult .
if the increase of consciousness can only be reached by the Ang@@ affen and the object of male athletes , according to The Wall Street Journal recently , Mr Do@@ ol@@ ey awaits his after air ring , new fans .
&quot; a generation protest@@ ing &quot; in Ethiopia , Long a Verb@@ ally of the United States
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators , demand political changes in Ethiopia , beat the government &apos;s violent resistance to Ethiopia .
witnesses say that the police have been killed during cl@@ ashes with the police .
is Ethiopia straight to break ?
over the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally to the western world with rapidly growing economy .
but in the last months , protests against the government and the country continued to move in more areas .
last week thousands of people killed on streets and requested fundamental political changes .
the government was un@@ mer@@ ciful according to human rights organisations .
witnesses said that police officers sh@@ ook and killed captains over twenty armed forces .
in the movement , the videos found about the protests that are probably from the last or beginning of this year , show how security people have sm@@ ashed young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a hand against a wall .
the chief of the UN agency for Human Rights now demands a detailed analysis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was always difficult to join this country and there will be even more difficult , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia is the most populated country of Africa into Nigeria and its stability is estimated from the West .
American military and secret services collabor@@ ates closely with Ethiop@@ ians to fight terror across the region , especially in Somalia . only few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much western help .
Ethiopia economy expanded in a respec@@ table pace .
its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new P@@ end@@ ler@@ suit in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
the streets are generally quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia was all other than a role for democracy - human rights organizations continued to continue suppression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , with dis@@ sidents were effective for silence .
many were killed into exile or in prison , or cast into the wilderness of the wilderness .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you supp@@ ress people and these no other options have to be protest@@ ing , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sey@@ ou@@ m Tes@@ home &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire youth has been Protestant .
a generation Protestant .
there are numerous complaints , which cover everything from the ground up to the saus@@ age in terms of power of the coalition .
after a nationwide election of last year , the reg@@ aining Party and its allies gain the last seat of the opposition and control 100 percent of the parliament .
at the same time , the ten@@ sions climb along the border to Erit@@ rea , a battle for this z@@ ack@@ ed , disp@@ uted line called in June hundreds of lives .
analy@@ tics fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , which were more or less than in the last years , to protect the tur@@ bul@@ ence and could be armed .
several factors explain why feelings of de@@ bit@@ ing after years is now explo@@ red under the surface .
the first seems harm@@ less : smartphones .
only in recent years many Ethiop@@ ian were able to communicate through the social media , since cheaper smartphones have been more common , and the Internet services have been improved .
even if the government un@@ lock the access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do in regular intervals , especially in protests , do many people still communicate over internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide themselves where they hold themselves .
several young Ethiop@@ ian nationals said that they were so popular among the protests .
the second factor is that there are more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two major eth@@ nic@@ ities in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are no natural enemies .
since Ethiopia , Am@@ har@@ as , who come from branches of predominantly Christian floods , in the politics and economy , while it explo@@ ited the Oro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and in Flach@@ land areas .
but this does not change .
&quot; we are to coordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of Oro@@ mos .
the biggest protests found in the areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , which accounts for about 6 percent of the population , and which are dominant in the military , in the secret services , and politics .
the third reason for the rest is death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr Mel@@ es , a former rebellion leader , was up to his death in a non @-@ public disease in 2012 for 17 years , Ethiop@@ ian prime ministers .
he was regarded as a tac@@ tical Genius , a man who could think about corners .
anal@@ ysts predi@@ ct that he was especially disp@@ uted in it , early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and to use special officers to make opponents and to make them dam@@ aging .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the present regime l@@ acks this fundamental gen@@ ome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen relatively unknown reasons to take the status of Mr Mel@@ es .
other than Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Southern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am come out of the South .
the analy@@ tics say that he did not enjoy the confidence of the security services provided by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood shed .
the last time that Ethiopia had experienced a uph@@ e@@ aval in 2005 , after thousands of elections , who agree to thousands of elections that were apparent from the government , and then stolen from the government .
while the following Raz@@ zi@@ es were killed , even though it were less than in the last months , and that time of the un@@ rest went relatively fast .
development experts praised Ethiopia leader for their visionary infrastructure planning , as the new P@@ end@@ ler@@ suit , as well as for their meas@@ ur@@ able progress at the poverty line .
but obviously , this is not the intensi@@ fication of the internal mis@@ fortune of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes an ethnic form .
the last month of the protest@@ ers in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ ic city , by Tig@@ ray , guided shops on and the h@@ ass across the tig@@ ray is more common in social media .
analy@@ tics say that protests like the United States and other Western allies can bring in a pec@@ uli@@ ar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights via the adjacent Somalia , even if she recently admitted that she closed this base .
while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want to join the ally @-@ vol@@ at@@ ile area in a already vol@@ at@@ ile area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin break . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump declares his claim Obama &apos;s asser@@ tion was &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m . &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump was trying to scatter the last contro@@ vers@@ y on Friday the last contro@@ vers@@ y , that his campaign concerns , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not serious .
this clari@@ fication asked new questions concerning the communication skills of the Presi@@ dential data of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans whether he is able to communicate and under@@ stand@@ able with the American public .
it also brings his fellow soldier who ende@@ av@@ our to take him during an event@@ ful phase in protection to explain statements , which he could not be meant .
after he had made the indication of a campaign event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump had made reference to the asser@@ tion on Thursday and insi@@ sted on interviews on Thursday , President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning sound on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump , he just said that he is simply Sardin@@ ian .
in contrast to the previous day , Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he said the alleg@@ ations totally serious .
when the conservative radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hug@@ h He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to we@@ aken the statement something that Mr. Obama wants to destroy him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy the republi@@ can presidential candidate .
the last storm of criticism on Mr. Tr@@ ump down , while he tries to direct the focus of his campaign due to failure to change the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton held spe@@ ech@@ es to the economic situation in Michigan in this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump tried again to return this topic again .
on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clin@@ t would lead to higher taxes , and that he has bor@@ ing their speech bor@@ ing .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already submitted a sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July he moved strong criticism when he thought that the Russians should imp@@ ly Mrs. Clinton &apos;s e @-@ mails , however , he said &quot; Of course I thought the sar@@ cop@@ ic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to move the lingu@@ istic limits of politics and then return to ru@@ gs .
&quot; I think it is one of his ways to test how certain messages from his fans will be accepted as they arrive , and then , if necessary , &quot; depending on how the reaction falls . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication board , which observed the language of both candidates .
but I think it is clever enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough , so that they can interpre@@ t it in different ways .
instead of the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump has an even corrosive tone , since its change@@ over are dropped .
a new survey by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was released on Friday , showed a lead with a huge margin in the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ on @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally tried to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ vocation , he accused him to understand his critics , or to understand his statements .
but while being strengthened in the focus of attention in the past few months of its presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps Pur@@ pose his loy@@ al co @-@ stre@@ ak into the un@@ comfortable situation , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ant may also like his statements .
Rud@@ olph W. Giuli@@ ani , a former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps celebr@@ ities , there was great effort to defend the candidates in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday .
&quot; I believe what he says are legitim@@ ate , political comments , &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani said he was asked to the correc@@ t@@ ness of Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps . Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State .
it is true in this sense that Obama had been an almost unknown , small organization , he called it back@@ ben@@ chers , completely wrong and so on , because he ab@@ sent troops from Iraq .
most mainst@@ re@@ am rep@@ ublic@@ ans attempt to ar@@ gue that the government minist@@ ered to Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton had allowed to spread the situation in the Middle East under control .
before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and cast them out , on each of his words , to be re@@ prob@@ able and fought against him .
he fortified the &quot; poor , j@@ un@@ u@@ rous &quot; TV experts who try to understand and said , &quot; You cannot do it ! &quot;
some of the Democrats mo@@ cked on Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps exc@@ use only one further evidence that he is un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
once pushed over the market from the market , the café is in Green@@ point
ver@@ b Cafe was a cozy cafe in William@@ sburg , in which one could pay only cash , that &apos;s not a Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years a good coffee .
of course , the prices made from its Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ front .
the store in the summer of 2014 put down soap in the form of Cup@@ cakes .
local income became known as the last loss in an gent@@ lem@@ an city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ t wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is alter@@ ation , but I still cannot believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea hotel except and Ver@@ b is now a soap shop . &quot;
but if New York change is , it is also new fin@@ eness .
a restored Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same employees and a similar atmosphere .
coffee is still good .
Cisco Rodri@@ guez , the new owner of the Ver@@ b is a long @-@ standing employee of the old cafes , the owner and managing director of the new caf@@ és .
he began working in Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
when a customer offered to provide a money for a new external office , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ guez , 36 , retained a lot .
the same distributor for the Bag@@ els bought the same es@@ pres@@ so machinery model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old Ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ guez said that he also wanted to experiment .
he led new ingredients .
on the menu , sand@@ wi@@ ches there are sand@@ wi@@ ches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ ni@@ es such as cap@@ ers and auti@@ ously onions .
there are natur@@ alistic bowls .
the café offers no beer more , but there are fresh ju@@ ices .
after nine months Rodri@@ guez said that he had noticed a st@@ ained power to the previous generations .
&quot; many old customers were displac@@ ed from William@@ sburg , &quot; he said .
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in William@@ sburg , visiting the Ver@@ b .
even after moving to Green@@ point , she would take the way up .
after the Ver@@ b had closed , she gave a while the coffee t@@ ines said , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was clear that it was on the coffee and on the culture that I liked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks coffee again , even if she has ordered a bl@@ ended C@@ hai tea this day instead of their usual I@@ ced coffee , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long @-@ standing and faithful customer since the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went there before the work , and he always ordered that same .
&quot; I came a quarter after seven , every day , like a s@@ wis@@ s watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said .
photo Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment with new ingredients in the menu .
nowadays Ros@@ enthal can still get his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , eggs and cheese .
Rodri@@ guez said that he didn &apos;t need to handle a Gro@@ ll that the soap store has taken the old business area .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie has actually used a special soap for de@@ b with the cold bare coffee of coffee bar as a ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go on their offer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ guez said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional , Polish inhabitants Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new customer has been translated into Polish and Rodri@@ guez said that he did to introduce her to soon , so that his new neigh@@ bors will welcome you .
the site also has further advantages .
a local saf@@ t@@ locally would like to fill in the bott@@ led coffee into bottles and sell .
there is a chance that the café is expanded to a neighbouring building .
for many customers a new ver@@ b is sufficient to get their old favorites .
Joseph W@@ itt was Chief Apostle and said that he was destroyed in the soil when the café ended .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ om said that bet@@ ting the loc@@ als and a new coffee is felt like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .

the de@@ pri@@ ming dinner of the economic crisis in &quot; a rich meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his asc@@ ension to the President , Franklin Del@@ ano Roosevelt took his lunch at the oval office .
President Roosevelt , a F@@ ai@@ ble for an ingen@@ ious delic@@ acy of Fifth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de Fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water@@ mark soup .
his menu on that day was somewhat more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , potato pur@@ ée , and as Des@@ sert a pr@@ un@@ men@@ p@@ ud@@ ding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with the people , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man .
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans , as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both the food historian .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CH@@ OP Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was the Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Zi@@ egel@@ man tells about the life in a residential building at the Lower East Side of the food perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their newest collaboration , &quot; An an independent meal , &quot; which will be published on Tuesday at the Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they show culinary solidarity , when they meet with a re@@ porter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s sandwich shop for dinner , a small , schn@@ bo@@ died I@@ mb@@ iss at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 .
Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese off with olive oil , while Co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with potato pur@@ ée and mixture .
as the re@@ porter Min@@ ce ordered , this was the pair of discussion about food in the era of great depression .
&quot; rich food were very popular , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man .
there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from a ingredient and slightly cheaper that trig@@ gers the ingredient .
imagine how many pe@@ an@@ uts eat that they serve them as dinner .
CO@@ E grin@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have been in the stomach as lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the great depression , the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women bo@@ iled for male field workers and it was served fresh past@@ ed past@@ ed for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
it was the Americans that sent during the first world war to be star@@ ved Europeans . &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; draws the paths to which the country went to be no longer to be the Schl@@ ar@@ aff@@ enland .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was a time in food for the Americans a central , donated theme , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
likewise , the new bud@@ get@@ et was the new bud@@ get@@ ary : mysterious food such as bre@@ ads and can@@ ons were restored to stap@@ le food , the c@@ asserole dish as &quot; wonderful kind , Es@@ od@@ les recovered , when qui@@ che un@@ appet@@ ite ingredients could hide under a creative sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dr@@ ills .
meat , which was the centre of the American kitchen , was a rare luxury for many years .
strange bl@@ ends were tried , as a low @-@ cal@@ ory and nutr@@ itious ass@@ aul@@ ation occurred prior to taste or even healthy kitchen decor@@ um .
while searching for the book , which also includes recipes , Zi@@ egel@@ man prepared a dish from this ep@@ och , b@@ aked onion with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; it was not a popular supplement on noon , &quot; says Co@@ e .
Zi@@ egel@@ mann continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and b@@ aked onions don &apos;t match each other .
it was typical for many of the business recipes .
as never before or since then , household management - including Louise Stanley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the country &apos;s eating hab@@ its .
by having published recipes and articles in newspapers and journ@@ als , they encouraged and to transform p@@ amp@@ e as cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with carrots and carrots in delicious meals .
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a celebration of the historic le@@ ak@@ age .
in particular , the reports about the response to the government &apos;s response to the hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ Cake Essen st@@ ance .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa farmhouse kitchen in his kitchen , he sp@@ ice like the million @-@ million people of the world to whom he became .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the continental kitchen like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ate in a nearly gilded dining room and a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was del@@ ight@@ ful realistic .
President Roosevelt could perhaps have the same mist@@ akes if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or would have asked him to equi@@ p his stomach with his stomach .
as described in the book , the today &apos;s house@@ keeper composed of no interest in flav@@ ours by Ms. Roosevelt so that the White House brought the bor@@ ing food in Washington , but also one of the most closed food prepared . &quot;
many of the species from the era of great depression to deal with food , was rejected as soon as the country came back on the legs .
the Legacy : on our continued focus on calories and food , Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as science on food was applied .
the pair participated in writing to write the eating hab@@ its of Zi@@ egel@@ mans @-@ in @-@ in @-@ law - for example how they could not throw food .
&quot; she had a great fear of the waste of food , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man remembered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they really got sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was a sw@@ elling incident .
after the plates were evacu@@ ated at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they moved and Co@@ e a dessert which they had prepared at home : the pl@@ ums that President Roosevelt ate at noon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that it was a usual tri@@ ck , modest recipes to miss a nice name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no proposed cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone di@@ pped anything about a spoon into the nar@@ row@@ ns , brown Gli@@ b@@ ber one .
amazing things not bad .
CO@@ E got three times a surcharge .
like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ get@@ te , he said to his wife , &quot; A few finely di@@ ced wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
killed in bomb attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed Omar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ky all to save her life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died even with a Fass@@ bomb attack against the Assad regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Omar was a member of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; White Hel@@ mets &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a civil society that according to Image Newspaper so far saved by nearly 60,000 people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
29@@ 00 Vol@@ unte@@ ers put their own life on the game to move people out of cr@@ ush houses and aff@@ ord first aid in the war .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : a video of the civil society that shows him with a 11 @-@ hour rescue of a house from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians to the shining symbolic figure in the grave of war .
however , as heroes , he has never seen himself , said : &quot; for me , the real Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I die there , I think that God sees in me a mart@@ yr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just before Omar fell victim to a victim , he had talked about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter have dropped four façade bombs over the Alz@@ adia district , one was filled with chlor@@ gas .
a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breathing .
&quot; we now eliminate the po@@ ison@@ ous remains of the bomb , so that no children may play , &quot; quotes the picture his last words before he died .
the dead@@ ly Bom@@ b of the Assad regime must meet terror@@ ists .
Greenland : the oldest cycl@@ ine is nearly 400 years old
more rare sight .
Greenland &apos;s disease usually come to a surface finish in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board of the research ship S@@ anna .
it was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats at a distance of 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland did not get offspring at the age of 150 .
in an hour it is just 1,@@ 220 meters far from the northern Atlantic Ocean , along the northern Atlantic coast , an average of 1,@@ 220 meters .
only when it comes up , the five metre @-@ long animal accelerates to sat@@ te 2.6 km / h - and this top speed is half as fast as a seal .
this lon@@ el@@ iness lifestyle seems to be a sponsor@@ ship for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reports in the journal Science &quot; at least one Greenland who could be 392 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alexander Sch@@ eu@@ er@@ lein , from the Max Planck Institute for demo@@ graphic research in Rostock these life span which means for verteb@@ rates a world record . &quot; &quot; &quot;
indeed , the ev@@ olu@@ tionary approach believes that Greenland &apos;s disease is already long .
only the evidence was missing .
Greenland &apos;s hair is difficult to observe , finally they live mainly in the polar sea before the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ b@@ ard .
because they are water @-@ temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they dive in the surface usually only in winter .
researchers en@@ ligh@@ tens the lifestyle of Greenland &apos;s lifestyle as little as little .
her tim@@ el@@ dest li@@ mb@@ s can be worn as they were sitting in front of the top six animals with one transmitter .
prey do this shar@@ ks : on the stomach of a animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the pine bones of a young iron .
possibly they ch@@ ase them sleeping animals or pat@@ rol@@ s at the bottom of the iron side and are looking for cad@@ aver , that sw@@ ings out of higher water slide under the bottom .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland , the f@@ ishers between 2010 and 2013 , before Greenland or S@@ val@@ b@@ ard .
the smallest shar@@ k was only 81 centimeters long while the biggest 502 centi@@ metres measured .
to determine the age of animals , they analyzed the carbon @-@ 14 method of the shar@@ k .
this centre of the eye lens is already produced before the birth of the shar@@ ks , which contained in it later not renewed anymore .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had a lot of carbon @-@ 14 in the lens .
their birth should therefore lie to the atmosphere after the early 1960s , as nuclear weapons attempts to gain larger amounts of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere .
in which 220 centi@@ metres of length , the Lin@@ sen@@ ses contained a low surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from nuclear weapons , it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in his investigation in 2012 .
all larger Greenland ones had a normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts , which arises in the atmosphere by cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 o &apos;clock showed an age of 335 years with an age of 335 years , while the record @-@ shar@@ k with 502 centimeters is likely to be 392 years old .
that Grön@@ land@@ hai @-@ females first became ob@@ sol@@ ete , if it is more than four metres , it was known .
now , researchers were able to arrange the length of an old age .
since one of the animals with 392 centimeters is probably at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age at 156 years was determined , Greenland with a multip@@ lication of at least one and a half centuries .
this might be the world record currently world record .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live mainly in icy waters , is no co@@ incidence .
the previous record holder , a 211 @-@ year @-@ old Greenland , where the back on the neck was captured a 120 year old har@@ po@@ on top , was caught on Alaska .
due to low temperatures , the organ@@ ism of the living animals often goes to savings of savings .
so you mature later - and al@@ ps slower .
in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals often are very large .
because the volume is much faster than its surface due to the animal warmth .
the heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much larger than one gram of eleph@@ ant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; small animal lives more dangerous and should focus on that , as soon as possible as possible many generations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the evolution of ev@@ ic@@ ologist Sch@@ eu@@ er@@ lein . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very big animal should invest its resources earlier in a long life .
construction site in double pack
with topics about building , the Municipal Council has concentrated in the recent meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the committee of Mayor Robert P@@ utz decided that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of recent residential areas can begin to begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after being clari@@ fied according to the plot , par@@ cel@@ eration and en@@ ligh@@ tening requests , the sale of plots in the residential areas &quot; Road Traffic &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( binding section 1 ) is no longer necessary in the way .
the church is convinced that the construction of the construction works prepared in the rural and peaceful residential community Schön@@ au young families and equi@@ voc@@ al senior citizens .
as it was stated , Baumeister may report itself in the City Hall , via the awarding of the plots to be advised in its September meeting .
in order to also en@@ quiries about the res@@ ett@@ lement of other industrial enterprises , linked to the creation of jobs , decided to change the newly created land plan in the spring of this year .
thus , in the area of Lower Saxony , the commercial area is extended by two plots in the direction of state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
the City of Main has therefore held the best opportunities in the competition with Paris , Dublin , and Luxembourg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt am most benef@@ ited from the Bre@@ x@@ it vote , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ li@@ ken , Head of the Financial Markets and Real Estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
following the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is un@@ certain whether money will continue to operate from London &apos;s financial transactions within the whole EU .
for the so @-@ called EU Pass , they have so far been approval in Britain .
this is just big US banks .
several banks have already announced plans to move jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lob@@ by@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be charged with 10000 new jobs in the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the registered office of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks of the euro zone , as well as other important authorities as the European insurance company E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk provisions ES@@ R@@ B .
although in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) have become its head office , but this is less important for the financial sector less than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the music bank is important for banks because they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luxembourg stays a large fund industry , cutting off as well as Dublin in infrastructure .
Frankfurt am very easy to reach thanks to the large airport .
further points the city with easily available commercial real estate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ li@@ ken . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the Seine , the rent for first @-@ class commercial real estate companies is 50 percent higher than am Main .
in addition , Frankfurt also provides a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime .
in a ranking of the company consulting Mer@@ cer stand the city on No.@@ 19 , Luxembourg at No. 19 , Dublin on No.@@ 33 and Paris on 3@@ 7th place .
even when life quality is a question of pre@@ ferences : &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors , &quot; follow the I@@ W .
but London , however , remains the most important financial center in Europe , but my economic for@@ ger .
therefore , the forces also said : in London , according to figures of Landesbank Hel@@ aba , around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking sector , in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2500 .
Gilead receives legal costs from the hepatitis C patent with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. counter@@ judge decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to a refund of the legal costs which you have created from the h@@ epat@@ its C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was liberated from a compensation payment of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , who stood in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs drug S@@ ov@@ al@@ di and Har@@ v@@ oni of Gilead , after a US judge issued a pattern of mal@@ ign@@ ity from Mer@@ cks , including Mein@@ el@@ des and other in@@ eth@@ ical actions .

Mer@@ ck tries to reduce the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines , which can cure over 90 percent of patients with the liver disease .

Clin@@ t earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % Bundes@@ bank
Hill@@ ary Clinton published its tax statement for 2015 which resulted in the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband &apos;s income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective Federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , the Clinton &apos;s USD 1 million made a char@@ itable purpose , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; the former President Bill Clinton &apos;s former President Bill Clinton &apos;s former Foreign Minister sent a revenues of USD 3 million from Verlag Simon &amp; Sch@@ uster for her book in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clin@@ t candidate for the Vice @-@ President , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton his tax returns of the past ten years .
they paid an effective Federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to set standards in relation to financial transparency , &quot; Clin@@ t Clin@@ er Pal@@ mier@@ i announced his position in a opinion .
in a stark contrast Donald Tr@@ ump hidden behind the wrong failure and re@@ covers in terms of his previous promises to publish its tax returns .
it is custom@@ ary for US presidential candidate to publish their tax returns , although they are not obliged by the law .
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers as a reason for its ref@@ using to control the tax authorities .
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; Clin@@ t wrote Ian Sam@@ s in Twitter , referring to the publication of the presidential candidate in the Democrats .
on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ um@@ ps Special advis@@ ers , to CN@@ N , that he would not allow dr@@ ump to be able to publish something before the aud@@ its are not completed .
Tr@@ um@@ ps Crit@@ ics , among other things also the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already deser@@ ted that his ref@@ us@@ al issues related to wealth , its donations for charity institutions , and various other connections , in particular with Russia .
Clinton had already crash@@ es on the subject and released a video on the Internet , in which the high @-@ level rep@@ ublic@@ ans can publish its tax returns .
on Thursday they spoke the topic even during a speech to the economy in Michigan .
&quot; he ref@@ uses to do what any other Presi@@ dential candidate has done in the past decades and to publish its tax returns . &quot; she said to the crowd .
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO reported that Tr@@ ump has paid for two years or not only very little taxes , and an econom@@ ist of the New York Times quoted a number of tax@@ pay@@ roll and tax advis@@ ers , the information that could still be the case .
Bundes@@ bahn has become a theme in the election campaign .
Clinton assi@@ sts a control that is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren buff@@ ets that would have more than USD 1 million to earn a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during a election event for Hill@@ ary Clinton in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ gl@@ omer@@ ate here has its seat , to exchange their tax returns to a meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had been subjected to a control test of the IRS as well as Tr@@ ump , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear of voters and not before tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ t Campa@@ ign has withdrawn its tax returns as far as 2007 .
Clin@@ ics , which now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , we paid an effective Federal tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % .
the tax statement of the Clin@@ t of 2015 showed that these only USD 100 % of their income is considered a reward , unlike the majority of all Americans .
its main funds was an effective index fund , from which the Clin@@ t divi@@ den@@ ds and earnings of USD 10@@ 9,000 contributed .

natural protective in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ x type to hold eleph@@ ants in it , in people living settlements on them - they t@@ oss con@@ doms to them that are filled with Ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der .
the method has proven effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which had already trained the idea ahead of years ago , trained together with U.S. natural protection , trained volunteers in villages in the northern Tanz@@ anian , a violent fourth @-@ step method to protect their houses and harvest@@ ing without viol@@ ating animals .
previously many sp@@ ear used to defend themselves .
Friday is World Health Day , dedicated to animal protection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we have developed the ... tool@@ kit , we couldn &apos;t observe to change the eleph@@ ants from their fields , without the eleph@@ ants to harm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ rie Dam@@ ian Bell in a Communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first two steps include the ligh@@ ten@@ ants of the eleph@@ ants with a tor@@ ch and the bub@@ bles in a horn .
if it is not slo@@ ped , a so @-@ called &quot; Ch@@ ili@@ ft &quot; is thrown .
Ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der mixed with earth will be packed along with a fire body in a con@@ dom , whose end is turned off to the ignition timing .
when it is ign@@ ited , the con@@ dom uses a pop up and spra@@ yed fine dust to Ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der into the air .
a touch is usually taken out in order to hunt the eleph@@ ants .
a final way is a factory , which sho@@ ots a gold fire@@ works into the air and caused a no@@ isy , bright explosion .

Jewish director dis@@ gu@@ arding the Berlin Hotel because Israeli pre@@ fix was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; Inv@@ itation - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots lies un@@ ce@@ asing a media road after he had betrayed the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Bristol Hotel in Berlin , since there would be Arabic guests according to one employee . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the hol@@ oc@@ out documentation &quot; Sho@@ a &quot; sent his anger at the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by winning an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann Israel tried to find on the international selection list .
the country , however , was not listed among the countries which can be accessed directly from the hotel rooms .
how is it in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel has eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol provides a possibility to choose Israel via an own call center .
after a statement , the director turned to the hotel reception area .
the answer that he received there , &quot; sho@@ cked him , &quot; how Lanz@@ mann wrote .
the hotel stated that the measure was a clear decision by the management of Kemp@@ in@@ ski hotels . &quot;
the reason that behind it , dis@@ band@@ ed more gro@@ ove in the director .
&quot; most of our guests are Arab and they have demanded that the pre@@ fix will be deleted , the employee of Lanz@@ mann was quoted .
the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man named this a &quot; big shame &quot; , &quot; reports the South German newspaper .
we were horri@@ fied by this event and dis@@ ma@@ yed .
this is really very disp@@ leased .
the fact that this happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even a major dis@@ grace .
it does not need any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right conclusion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ministers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident revealed a rather big reson@@ ance on the internet , where people asked the whole a sc@@ and@@ al .
some recently introduced the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Hotel , that it had abandoned the alleged name of Arabic guests . &quot;
&quot; ashamed of you , &quot; it was stated in another post that was pointed out that the hotel is located in the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , close to a synagogue .
the hotel quickly instructed all the alleg@@ ations of himself and called the incident a &quot; missing &quot; and &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , Der Spiegel reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct statement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Israel does not accept the quick@@ est list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;

you could say that the record pay Iranian tourists will be broken in Russia from the last year , &quot; he said .
at the same time , only a few Russians visit Iran , some of whom the ambassador tru@@ st@@ eth that it will change .
&quot; I personally can recommend the visit of the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d who received the monuments of the old Persian civ@@ ilization in a good condition , &quot; he said .

Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner is stor@@ ms to home , as Br@@ ite Gold for cycling tourism
Scotland Call@@ um Sk@@ inner has defended the title of London 2012 for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 in Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor of the anchor of Sir Chris Ho@@ y . the J@@ enny and David &apos;s legend were proud when he stor@@ med to home a victory of the favorites of New Zealand .
Britain claimed a sho@@ cking victory over four years ago , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympi@@ ag@@ ol@@ d@@ medals .
they repeated the trick , after they took place in March at the London World Championships in London , despite the return of Ho@@ ys only a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the An@@ ais Jamie Staff .
they just did it in time as a Hin@@ der .
he retired a gap that tried to close the K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ ampton .
Sk@@ inner was the man , where they stayed when they saw the potential in the vill@@ i , which now un@@ folds .
hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - that were winning four years ago with Ho@@ y - and Sk@@ inner sat in the qualifying round a Olympic record , but in the round @-@ round the New Zealand prevailed in the first round .
and the British Trio won the du@@ el with gold .
it was just under the lap of his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and Sk@@ inner .
a strategy change made a large part of the transformation , in which hin@@ ts in a higher gear to slow it down and make it Kenn@@ y and above all sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y saw from his position as a BBC expert from his position , Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Behin@@ d , was on the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am just here to do my best and make a name to me .
we set up an Olympic record in the En@@ dr@@ unde and defeated the World Champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win .
after the triumph in 2012 at the site Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys there was a way that he dropped to the track after a weak start .
he returned this statement later and there was no obj@@ ection of England Ri@@ vals .
this time there was no problem with such a complete victory .
Hin@@ du said : &quot; it feels all the GB flags on the grand@@ stand like London . &quot;
we came together in the last three months as a team .
we are so bad in so many world tit@@ els so bad that it was incredible again to win the Olympi@@ ad again .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation that has won seven of 10 titles both in Beijing as well as in London .
if this is a Bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect a successful five days in Vel@@ od@@ rom .
with the Form Kenn@@ ys it is possible in the realm of Pos@@ sible that he repeated Ho@@ ys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition .
that would be for Kenn@@ y - the exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on 23rd March ( a apparently holy date for the British sports ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal .
the cage of Ho@@ y is equal .
Kenn@@ y comes to the Sprint , which starts today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enjoy this just for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always best .
one can win it with his colleagues .
it feels like something to win alone .
Hin@@ der said , &quot; If he wins two more gold medals , he should be ro@@ uted to the k@@ night . &quot;
it was the only med@@ alli@@ sts competition of the day , but there were further news for England .
Sir Bra@@ ve W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ov@@ ain Dou@@ ll be qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four @-@ kilometre race .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 942 at the destination .
the world record that won gold in London in 2012 was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held today on the second day of the contest , which will focus on the W@@ ig@@ gins with safety .
yesterday , in front of the qualification , he fought against the qualification as officials to measure his height .
in the respective women &apos;s competition , tomorrow , Laura Des@@ p@@ ite , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ ie in World War Time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB team is leaving his strong railway team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to collect a bu@@ ar of medals .
after a truly exceptional display of absolute Domin@@ ic in Beijing and London , expectations for Rio fell down .
we played a drummer in the background , as the re@@ sign@@ ation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April am@@ id@@ st of sex and mo@@ b@@ b@@ ings , as well as retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ leton .
however , if one sees the first evening of the competition in Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks quite later than it could be the legendary call GB@@ S , which has reached its cli@@ max again , again .
future of the melting of Portland , based on the abol@@ ition of energy contract
the future of the Aluminium sch@@ mel@@ ze of Portland , Victoria , as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - are available on the game since the system operator will termin@@ ate the energy supply contract , so that all delivery contracts will begin to split the supplier of energy companies .
this step followed by the government &apos;s decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsi@@ dies to operate the system .
for 20 years the payout takes place in November .
up to 2000 work@@ places in the complex of Al@@ coa in Portland , Portland , stand on the game .
not less than 2000 jobs , direct and indirect speech could end@@ anger@@ ed at a closing time .
in addition , it could come to Domin@@ ic effects , as the melting department consumes approximately 10 percent of the total power generation Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as .
in 2014 , Al@@ coa joined the Point of Henry too , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year .
the melt of Al@@ coa in Portland loses money and ris@@ ky a lock .
this step follows the lon@@ ely long spec@@ ulations regarding the future of the system , initially as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the current price of the plant .
AG@@ L , who supplies the big aluminium shells with his Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , distributed that three additional owners will termin@@ ate their contracts .
the complex is located in the majority of a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ en@@ i Cor@@ p are smaller .
&quot; AG@@ L will assume that the plant will continue to operate in Portland , which means a further physical demand for electricity through the melting , &quot; divided the company . &quot;
AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts so @-@ called &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; should be entered into force since November 2016 .
the contracts have a 12 month period of notice , so it will end in 2017 .
&quot; therefore , AG@@ L will assume that the contracts in the 17 financial year will contribute to the revenues , &quot; said the current supplier .
all potential impact on AG@@ L demand from G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the high season prices for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L divided the value of the contracts already in its annual financial statements of $ 187 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of a termination . &quot;
Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the tre@@ aties , the &quot; Sk@@ ill Al@@ co@@ as ... the melting has to operate or ensure the power supply to the sm@@ ashed water . &quot;
the US company said that in 2010 it would have completed a 20 year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who would have entered into force in November of this year , even if it is still a declaration , why it has returned from the contract .
analy@@ ti@@ cian stood due to the bad economic conditions in the industry in front of the possible closure of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near Newcastle .
in reference to the statements of the Analy@@ ti@@ cian at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Portland employs approximately 900 megawatts and Tom@@ ago about 900 megawatts .
if both plants disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; current market &#93; .
and for us as a power generator that would not be good , &quot; he said .
more than just a kar@@ y@@ hi@@ an reality TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of V@@ ogue
K@@ end@@ all J@@ en@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ en@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ en@@ ner C@@ lan@@ s Kr@@ is is on the cover of the most prestigious sept@@ ation edition of the US V@@ ogue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der , who ran on the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on its Inst@@ ag@@ ram account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people who I love , brought me the sight of this cover to weeping , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the unveil@@ ing of the cover followed a bizar@@ re ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Family and producers of Ke@@ eping Up R@@ yan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , as it ends the cover of her sister and ends with a classic turn : they have planned all a surprises @-@ party .
this is the cl@@ ee@@ ee@@ zed hands close to every birthday . ( Se@@ ac@@ remnant gave the sentence , &quot; You knew that we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a drawing site at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to be able to participate in this public@@ ity .
with regard to the September issue of the V@@ ogue , a new era of the kar@@ a@@ hi@@ hi@@ ans began with safety .
K@@ end@@ alls big sister Kim is what the V@@ ogue cover goes , they have struck ( they and her husband Kan@@ ye West were on it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the german magazine is a league for itself .
the September issue is the most popular issue of the year for V@@ ogue .
with a circumference that resem@@ bles a picture band as a fashion magazine , the output draws a large number of advertising strips ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista , the 8@@ 32 pages of the Rolling Bear@@ ings 615 pages advertising ) .
the unveil@@ ing of his code stars is anticipated that in the last two years images of the magazine still le@@ ak@@ age in front of the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Moss .
in recent years , more &quot; celebr@@ ities , the Mod@@ ules &quot; as &quot; Models , the celebr@@ ities are &quot; on the cover .
Oscar @-@ Pre@@ ist@@ lau@@ der and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jenni@@ fer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
but even at the low chance that Mr@@ s J@@ en@@ ner - which is described by the magazine as the &quot; sustained model &quot; of their generation - below the previous category , it is in good company .
these celebr@@ ities are not related to famous persons or reality stars or young people from today that know how to turns out a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if everything is true on J@@ en@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who draw themselves in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once appeared on the last cover , with the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of her career .
of course J@@ enn@@ ers don &apos;t like success every one .
with its reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ ai was standing position in the fashion world .
in June , the ch@@ ore Victoria &apos;s Secret model Steph@@ anie Sey@@ m@@ our J@@ en@@ ner and her Kol@@ leg@@ in Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d and named them &quot; the mist@@ ress of the eye . &quot;
this feelings bo@@ iled down again when the news came out with the release J@@ enn@@ ai on the V@@ ogue Cover .
but on the Mis@@ sm@@ ut you sometimes seems to proceed to the point .
K@@ end@@ all J@@ en@@ ner is on the cover of the September issue of V@@ ogue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
it runs for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your prim@@ dation from Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all your sisters sell you images of their respective Pay@@ wall Apps .
it sells pictures of Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the magazine LO@@ VE .
and in their leisure time it is visible in reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
municipal centres show year 16@@ 0,000 people every year
more than 16@@ 0,000 members of the country &apos;s relief measures are rejected every year by the municipal centres , while the sector gained further deep@@ en@@ ings on the effects of further aver@@ ages .
in Queens@@ land , three of five people - mostly elderly people , immig@@ rants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ real del@@ og@@ ations and similar products - they are looking for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services in the municipality , which are already over@@ ly util@@ ised , are ready for further cuts .
starting in June next year , this legislation will lose a further 30 per cent of their federal agents .
the director of the Municipal Council of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rel@@ l said that the last survey of the National Association of Community Cent@@ res revealed that thousands of people were exp@@ elled every year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation without repe@@ aling the decision of the federal government would only be worse .
&quot; Queens@@ land Common Cent@@ res are chron@@ ically financed , which means tens of thousands of people from important services that you need to be rejected , &quot; he said .
people who leave the violent relations , people with un@@ mist@@ ak@@ able and refresh@@ ing debts , families who were dismissed by separ@@ ations - all these people have problems with just@@ ification and this collection , that they cannot get the help they need .
the federal government will be cut by 30 percent from June 2017 , which means that thousands of help people from Queens@@ land will be forced to meet with their legal problems without any help .
we call for the Federal Minister and Justice of Queens@@ land George Bran@@ dis as well as trans@@ formers from Queens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to stop this middle ab@@ brevi@@ ations , so that people may need help to maintain legal problems .
last year , the state government fulfilled its promise to raise funds for legal entities on the national average .
it is now at the time to view the needs of the community centres and their customer communities , as well as the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government invested in this important work .

the successor today domin@@ ate the world - its producer had experienced a disaster .
the device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as hard as an iPhone 5 .
it was th@@ icker and bigger , it was not good in hand .
on the contrary , it was quite kno@@ b .

in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent to a lot : SMS and emails were sent and received , also by fax , the Communic@@ ator has been reached .
even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browser when it is slow slowly .
a calcul@@ ator was available , an digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile could be folded similar to a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
the price is quite proud of : 2700 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 Euro .
the average selling price of a Smartphones in Germany was 392 euros in 2015 .
no one could say in August 1996 that the Communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
the clever phones are a success story , if not for Nokia .
the game card of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented des@@ aster , was finally sold to Microsoft .
today , the market will rule today , which came out as Nokia .
always and everywhere online , which is today for a lot of people everyday life .
in 2015 there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
approximately 1.4 billion devices were sold , on Samsung and Apple account alone is 555 million pieces .
the worldwide turnover of the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
this is the well @-@ going business of the countless app provider and the telecommunic@@ ations concert .
a whole industry has been created around the smartphone .
the decisive breakthrough for the mass market occurred in early 2007 , at that time , Apple @-@ CEO Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a phone and a Internet communications , easy to use on touch screen .
the triumph@@ al train of Apple began , today is the iPhone is the most important product of the corporation .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had the offspring .
they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
all ages now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the Smartphone is 20 years after his invention a self @-@ understanding .
on average , every German has been looking for 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to learn all the smartphone &apos;s smartphone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just Jan@@ ina Ball , has been responsible for the Siemens Management Board in Siemens &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the permanent accessibility is now considered to be a curse and blessing .
England must bro@@ aden the Olympic spirit and He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row is not only in our local municipalities and throughout London , but in the whole country of renewal and prosper@@ ity .
for me it was the biggest attraction in He@@ ath@@ row , just as we were in London in 2012 , when we had a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions are benef@@ ited from games .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great advantages for Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and that will reach again by being able to create new possibilities for local and firms near He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local congregations alone , we will already create 10,000 new apprentices , creating 40,000 new jobs and prepare a youth unemployment in the airport environment .
as they were ahead in London 2012 , such will be such that the challenge of the extension of He@@ ath@@ row is too large .
I told me that England will never be ready for the games and that we will show us at the world stage .
the two fl@@ atten@@ s had in@@ justice in 2012 and they are also wrong at He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answered them every question .
as the Olympic Games is He@@ ath@@ row for many and not for single infrastructure project .
expansion is a possibility to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion on wit@@ ty growth , creating a legacy of skills and employment to both the airport and the whole GB .
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has been implemented a £ 11 billion in time and budget , from T5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , until the T2 , which was built in the midst of the two frequencies test run of the world .
now they are ready to supply a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
the London Games of 2012 was a great success for GB and I am confident that the addition of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time that we continue to expand this Olympic spirit and create He@@ ath@@ row and create our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment to be proud of England .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Ad@@ block Plus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ atz and Maus@@ oleum &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerning display block@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a software manufacturer , for companies that earn attempts to handle money online , ad block and mouse clicks is equal to any of the software manufacturers .
on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad block@@ ers on his des@@ kt@@ op@@ side , Ad@@ block Plus released a blo@@ g@@ post that allows users to upgrade their filters in the program to block advertis@@ ements related to social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook with that his des@@ kt@@ op@@ site would change the coding concerning his advertis@@ ements , to make it ad @-@ cur@@ b the recognition , which is part of the page advertising to make more difficult .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to circum@@ vent the new codes .
in a blo@@ g@@ post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of h@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her struggle between the most striking open source community and the change@@ over have been possible since the invention of display block@@ ers in the track , and that it is possible that Facebook is coming soon with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest company has left the struggle for social media in the fight is a strong inde@@ x@@ ing system for the industry .
according to a study carried out worldwide by Pa@@ m@@ air and Adobe about 200 million people display ads , almost four times as much as 2013 .
with 1.0@@ 3 billion daily users active users who access their mobile devices on Facebook makes a hand@@ y@@ iel@@ ding 84 percent of the value affected Fac@@ eb@@ ooks .
the company does not need to block ad block on Desktop PCs , as mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Fac@@ eb@@ ooks mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ ag@@ ram , shared a speaker with .
advertising on Desktop PCs makes a sufficient amount of revenue , so Facebook is the investment of such stri@@ de as worthwhile .
on Tuesday , Facebook told that it would be a &quot; ad refer@@ enced &quot; tool to have more control over it on it .
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ block would have al@@ ous@@ ed new filters because they would also block content on the side which are no advertising .
&quot; for users , this is not a positive experience , therefore we plan to arrange the problem , &quot; shared a spokes@@ person on Facebook in an e @-@ mail message .
indicators are a dum@@ pl@@ ess , why we have focused on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to put more control into the hands of the people instead .
woman with suspected suicide on the Swiss highway
the sacrifice was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police calls on witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday with a suspected suicide of several vehicles on a fre@@ eway .
the incident happened on the A1 in the canton of Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
a woman taken in the Dun@@ kl@@ en &quot; in an act of desp@@ air &quot; on the streets and were hit by several cars , the police in Vau@@ d said .
it is obvious that a Swiss lady came in at the age of 49 , that of several vehicles , including a truck that was over@@ ride , would have to kill themselves .
she died still on site .
several drivers have already been taken , but some are still not identified , the police , who , as well as witnesses of inci@@ dents , said to report .
it was opened an investigation procedure , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , divided G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter before the Le Tribun@@ e de Gen@@ eve .
however , it remains to wait whether one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a coll@@ ision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something that the prosecutor needs to decide &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Court st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases over the past five years show that the driver will not be put to responsibility .
in each of the two cases - a person in the Dun@@ kl@@ en on the highway ran - was decided that drivers do not need to go out that a pedestri@@ ans running in the night on the highway as it was called in the newspaper .
last year a polic@@ eman was acquitted of negli@@ gence , after having killed a man and killed one night on the A1 in the vicinity of Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victims had drunk stuck together and has become conscious of the road .
the court noted that the polic@@ eman had answered for an emergency call -- on a justified way , and that the presence of a man on the road was a &quot; completely extraordinary and un@@ predic@@ table situation , &quot; said the judge .
everyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should sign at the police under number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 , 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA Klim@@ am@@ od@@ ell : Venus was once hab@@ itable
according to the proj@@ ections of a new NASA climate models probably once hab@@ itable .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus from tools and algorith@@ ms to resem@@ ble those of climate research .
the model was designed to determine if Venus with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 dens@@ ities could be deposited on similar conditions .
scientists have previously noted that the slow rotation of the Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have a thin , er@@ ron@@ eous environment , and slowly stopped slowly .
the model illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet argu@@ ably pointed out more dry opponents than the earth , but had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to host life and protected rapidly .
the early Venus benef@@ ited from one Sun , which was 30 percent matter .
in the G@@ ISS @-@ model simulation , the slow rotation of the Venus reg@@ ained its daily side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; declared G@@ ISS Scienti@@ sts Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ med the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds , which looks like a rain@@ screen to drive the surface from a large part of the sunlight .
the result is average temperatures that are some degree cooler than those of the earth today .
the model brought a history of Venus , which resem@@ bles the evolution that was suspected of planet research .
although it was probably still hab@@ itable , Venus -- was exposed to much heat and ultra@@ violet light in the course of several billion years .
their oceans evap@@ or@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was burned down by ultra@@ violet light .
when her Hydro@@ gen withdrew himself only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a dead@@ ly greenhouse effect - the Venus , which we know them today .
the researchers named the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Letters .
Patrick Roy goes back as a coach of the Aval@@ o@@ che
Patrick Roy coming back on Thursday as a trainer and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations of Colorado on Thursday and led to a decrease in decision on decision of the team .
alternatively , President / General Manager of Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the Association shall be searching immediately after a new trainer .
&quot; in the last three years I have met my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of Colorado near Energy , passion and cre@@ denti@@ ality , &quot; expressed the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a comment .
in the course of the summer long and much more about how I could improve this team to give him more depth , this is needed and to bring it to a higher level .
to achieve this , the Vision of the Train@@ ers and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be adapted to the organization .
he must also have a criminal law in decisions which influence the performance of the team .
these conditions are not met .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on May 23 , 2013 , than@@ ked him to his contributions to the team .
&quot; Patrick has informed me today on this decision , &quot; said Sak@@ ic .
we appreciate all what he did for our organisation and wish for the future just the best .
Roy was awarded as the best trainer of the League during his debut season at the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adam Awards .
he led the association to 112 points and placed on first place in Central Vision , but Colorado , in the first round of the play@@ offs of Minnesota , it was defeated in each of the two last years .
the Aval@@ an@@ ches signed in the 2015 @-@ 16 season a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 stamp and fell behind the game for a second Wild@@ card Spot in the Western Conference by five points .

Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ e@@ lar@@ us take up talks on , put the strike
the strug@@ gles in terms of re@@ mun@@ eration for North Sea e@@ un@@ lar@@ er are suspended , while all disp@@ utes parties shall set up a new meeting on the table , said the negoti@@ ator leader .
strikes against the oil @-@ field service provider Wood Group were performed spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms at the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wood Group and the Un@@ ite and r@@ ammed trade unions can confirm that we have united us to begin the winding process of current war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a common statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will keep several full @-@ day meetings over the next weeks , which will start beginning next year to rest@@ art the problems .
the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in 25 years , is a protest against potential pay@@ ab@@ brevi@@ ations of up to 30 percent .
in the North Sea , Wood Group has shortened the rates of its contra@@ sts in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s rat@@ ering reduction follows a 10 percent decline for on@@ shore contrac@@ tors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts to the company has required space to come by market down@@ turn .
Shell has dismissed for its part of thousands of people and plans to aband@@ on plans to aband@@ on its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries because its business activities are rati@@ onal@@ ized as a result of its meg@@ ac@@ us@@ al stack by the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure due to lower cru@@ de oil prices under pressure , a economic situation that decided to leave the decision of the British in June , the European Union .
the Scottish parliament of Parliament Dave Anderson met in the beginning of this week with workers to discuss one of the largest labour disp@@ utes since one generation in the North Sea .
the North Sea is important for regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we require a economy that works for many and not just a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 less than $ 1.4 billion on expenditure on new projects in the North Sea is expected to have an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Kepler &apos;s rot@@ ational rate of stars in star cluster of the Ple@@ j@@ ades
the newest Mission of Kepler &apos;s Wel@@ sh teles@@ cope helped ast@@ ray to collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of star@@ ry of Ple@@ j@@ ades .
the new data help the astronom@@ ers understand why stars in star clusters are rotating on different inst@@ al@@ ments as well as in which connection the rot@@ ational rooms with the planetary origin .
&quot; we hope that through the same our results with other star cluster , learn more about the relationship between the mass of a death , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the C@@ alt@@ ech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star cluster of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades is 445 light@@ years away from the earth .
many stars in this star cluster which emerged about 125 million years ago now reach adul@@ th@@ ood .
they now turn on the fastest .
at peak rotating rates these two @-@ stars large amounts of star@@ ches .
as these winds go through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a slow effect on the stars .
when a star does age , its rotation rate starts to slow down .
Kepler measures the rate of rotation of each star by reducing the time between the appearance of a recogni@@ z@@ able star@@ spot -- as solar ec@@ st@@ ains -- .
the latest catalog of Rot@@ ational rates pointing out that massive stars are slower than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with larger stars slower pi@@ rou@@ bles as smaller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ballet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Ple@@ j@@ ades you see that long rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be a very bright stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said re@@ g@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the star cluster of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmetic laboratory to compare reci@@ pro@@ s qualities such as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; the star cluster of the Ple@@ j@@ ades provides an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
it &apos;s still a lot ahead of us what we would like to see how , when , and why stars are s@@ lows down their rotation rates and so to speak their &quot; dancing shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and their colleagues have reported in detail about their latest analysis of the Rot@@ ational rates of the Ple@@ j@@ ades , which will soon be published in the astronom@@ ical journal .

&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &apos; Good@@ b@@ ye &apos; to the &apos; , stated the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star @-@ Game participants of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
th@@ rice was elected to the most valuable player of the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Y@@ ank@@ és .
his signature under one tenth year contract granted him 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he was in future as an advisor and youth coach - in full content .
as a player , Rodri@@ guez paid a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for its teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Leader@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he managed the Y@@ ank@@ és .
the Hall of Fame members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays have only two other bas@@ eball players in the most important statistics similar values .
but the 41 @-@ year @-@ old the 41 @-@ year @-@ old could not be recorded .
for so successful Rodri@@ guez - the nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - was so controversi@@ al , his appearance outside the square .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2009 , the super@@ star had been banned from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; between 2001 and 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , he was blocked for 211 games due to a survey in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ and@@ al by the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ guez is regarded as the main di@@ gest for many years over an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
after a legal dispute , the sperm has been reduced to 162 encoun@@ ters .
&quot; the League could even have done to me for the year 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; Rodri@@ guez said at that time .
his f@@ arewell days are not dis@@ appo@@ inting .
while many Bas@@ eball @-@ Leg@@ s have got the big stage once again , Rodri@@ guez was often sitting on the bench .

Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 will be translated from the first official D@@ op@@ ing@@ es .
an important athl@@ ete would have won almost a medal .
before the seventh race of the competition , the first official D@@ op@@ ing@@ cases become the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers Chen X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter @-@ obst@@ acle in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and the Polish weigh@@ t@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ in@@ ski were tested in Brazil - immediately before the start of the critical athlet@@ ics tournaments will occur these messages to the time .
already on the last Sunday the di@@ ure@@ tics had been tra@@ ced by hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ de that is used as m@@ asked resources for d@@ op@@ ing@@ sub@@ stan@@ ze .
on Friday afternoon the International Sports Court CA@@ S confirmed its exp@@ ulsion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon .
on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took the fourth place in the final over 100 m Butterfly , just about 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Chen was supposed to take part in the f@@ ooth@@ ills of over 50 m Fre@@ estyle .
Chen had requested the opening of the B sample and a hearing on the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) at the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association take the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very serious and demands Chen full cooperation with regard to research &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cited X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will work with the International Sports Court CA@@ S and will accept the judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history there is no longer the IOC , but CA@@ S is responsible for the refurb@@ ishment of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio sick@@ ly the news about the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ ova through , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on the offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is an incredible shock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be food supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the athlet@@ ics stadium . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report it is said to act with the verb@@ al substance for blood d@@ op@@ ing@@ agent EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ owa has been suspended in preliminary , according to B@@ NT , the B sample may also be positive .
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ jko Bor@@ is@@ sow dis@@ figured with criticism of the ath@@ ery of the Ath@@ ena .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the sport@@ s@@ men don &apos;t draw the right beats , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We Bulg@@ arians under observation , as many are already been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for instance , all weigh@@ t@@ lif@@ ter from the chron@@ ically un@@ loaded nation may not be able to participate in Rio .
on Friday , the case &quot; Adrian Target In@@ ski &quot; was also known as the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg , like his brother Tom@@ as@@ z had been positive on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on three days earlier .
both the in@@ gest@@ ion , both may not start in the class up to 94 kg .
before the start of athletes , Dan@@ ek@@ owa , another serious blow for the release of the entire sport .
the world association IA@@ AF had under@@ gone the complete Russian team to one exception because of systematic dro@@ op@@ ings , the L@@ äu@@ fer@@ nation Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio .

data kl@@ au : so per@@ fi@@ de press presses her rans@@ om
programmer from Er@@ gas@@ ket malware are currently targeted companies - and are successful .
according to a recent survey conducted by the malware @-@ defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes under 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of surveyed companies were at least once in the past twelve months , some of the victims of an attack with the press@@ er software .
in Germany , nearly 20 percent of companies were already aiming for a R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware Er@@ gas@@ ket .
40 percent of victims paid will@@ ingly offered by the perpet@@ rators required to re@@ use the challenged systems and data .
the perpet@@ rators speci@@ alize their awak@@ ening software according to the observ@@ ations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes on attacks in corporate networks .
if they are successful there , the potential rans@@ om rans@@ om is considerably higher than with private use .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we currently observe a troubled evolution of pollut@@ ants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes @-@ Chef Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 , most Mal@@ war@@ e@@ Program were still designed to send advertis@@ ements .
then discovered the pr@@ un@@ ning Software for himself .
only private use was the aim , but the change to the company was turned back in the past few months .
R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once on the computer of an ox , they search for un@@ long changed files like Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files as well as for archives of pictures and videos .
these files en@@ codes the R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustained .
afterwards , the software presents the demands of the compres@@ sors .
to get the final turn@@ key code to the files , the victims must pay money - usually in the form of the cryp@@ tion Bit@@ coin .
but where private use the personal photo database on the game , it is available to companies around sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production is shut down .
accordingly , the damage drops off when a R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware falls .
22 per cent of the affected German companies reported revenue losses by R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware , 13 per cent , even the business activity had to be broken down , in a case of people in Fat@@ al .
in Germany several million hospitals already have been threatened with attacks by attacks , whose patients can be threatened with the loss of health precau@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say the victims always : it is not paying attention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies you pay , their data will be back .
for managers it is difficult to re@@ ject the demand of the perpet@@ rators in the operation of a stand@@ still in operation .
the h@@ acker again know that and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the security researchers of F @-@ Secure have examined the payload areas and contact with the pres@@ cription and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
they explain their victims by chat , as they can pay via Bit@@ coin , set free access support websites a or de@@ cryp@@ t free example files .
and will private people be saved after payments of a few hundred Euros , companies must pay part hard negoti@@ ate and five @-@ digit sum@@ s to get their data un@@ lock .
in view of potentially high and relatively risk gains from R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware @-@ Er@@ aser , the h@@ ack@@ ers are always professional and share the work , explains safety experts Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ewski from the Internet provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware about within a week . &quot;

one for all the cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and everyday situations
in the small HR @-@ V Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little Coupé and even the versat@@ ility of a min@@ iv@@ ans .
sounds pretty good , but the HR @-@ V , which has been constructed on the same new platform as the new Jazz , has actually become extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1,@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear , it works very narrow .
the materials of the inside area are well finished and may work pleasant , only the cockpit @-@ top falls off there .
versatile as similar vehicles is the HR @-@ V at the storage box .
it is not only a trunk of 453 l at high @-@ sized and 10@@ 26 l covered with inver@@ ted back re@@ ject , but there are the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; .
this is less mag@@ ically when it sounds : the seat areas of the back cover can be up@@ swing like Kin@@ os@@ chair and provide storage space that is up to 1,@@ 24 m high from the ground up to the ceilings .
the boot space is well loaded , however , the loading height with 650 mm is slightly higher than in the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel engine with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
he is likely to render his work slightly qui@@ eter .
the everyday consumption of 4,7 l / 100 km is gr@@ ati@@ fying .
there is another engine optimization : a 1.5 liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
a all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the handling is balanced , a good compromise between dynam@@ ism and comfort .
but the steering is likely to be a bit direct .
the equipment is open in the tested Top version &quot; Executive &quot; no desires .
the City emergency braking system is part of the City emergency braking system ( operates at a speed of 32 ) , the coll@@ ision system and trace assistant .
at times , the coll@@ ision war@@ ns , because he evalu@@ ates many obstacles as &quot; her@@ ann@@ ah@@ ing objects . &quot;
the correspondence assistant is very reliable .
and the intelligent Tem@@ po@@ regulator respon@@ ds to traffic sign detection and thr@@ ott@@ le when needed .
but the full connectivity is only available for the top features : 7 @-@ inch touchscreen , Nav@@ i , App Integration and More .
two USB@@ - and an HDMI socket are located under the armrests and are therefore a bit um@@ er@@ ally stable .
the approximately 29@@ 000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
those who don &apos;t want to invest as much will receive the gasoline engine from 20000 Euro , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 Euro .
the engines comply with the Euro @-@ 6 emission standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and all @-@ day outdoor car .

disease accident : when paid the organizer
ill gets ill constantly after their journey , only money back if the cause of the disease can be found in the hotel .
however , this is only the case if more than 10 percent of the guests are reported to show the same symptoms .
in the negoti@@ ated case a family was heavy on the second day of their tur@@ qu@@ el@@ ism heavily in di@@ arr@@ he@@ a and vom@@ iting .

he had to go out until then that the sea was fine .
he did not viol@@ ate his information , so the judgment .
especially in the samples of water there were no im@@ pur@@ ities found .
the disease of several hotel guests - wom@@ ens@@ able through the infection of one another - is a common life risk .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 people were ill .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the refugees forced by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , in July , many people would have serious concern . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the state had to be so@@ ber and determined to react to terror@@ ists at the same time .
surely , our country will not answer the violence of the perpet@@ rators with hat@@ red and split .
this triumph we won &apos;t give the terror@@ ists .
if offen@@ ders should leave off the country , but the level of safety and strength is also the consent of the population for refugee policy .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère wants to achieve the implementation of proposals by the Bundestag election in 2017 .
he also announced another management reinforcement of security forces , namely &quot; in medium @-@ digit size order more than several years . &quot;
sympath@@ y for terrorism must be under punishment again .
video surveillance should be improved , tru@@ st@@ ably so nov@@ els , especially the purchase of weapons in the internet is set out .
the last much @-@ discussed silence light for doctors should remain constant according to de Mai@@ zi@@ ères .
however , he wants to search for solutions in dialogue with the medical examination based on solutions , as the threat of citizens could be reduced , he said with a look at the psych@@ ic int@@ ru@@ ity .
to counter@@ act a radi@@ cal@@ ization of refugees , the Minister holds a better social support for necessary .

for the persecution of crimin@@ als in special areas of the Internet ( Dar@@ k@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the use of conce@@ aled investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD leader Gabriel told : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything which contributes to increase safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important that the Interior Minister is clearly stated against action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a sorry for the s@@ cour@@ ge of the CDU / CS@@ U &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Gabriel told the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Media group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère sent re@@ fe from the Union to a Bur@@ ka ban and the abol@@ ition of double citizenship . &quot; &quot; &quot;

better traffic flow on the fre@@ eway
it is a regular basis on the stra@@ dd@@ ling road - here a picture of November .
however , this should change : the right angle should be extended .
this is a good news for all car drivers who stand in professional traffic on the ambient Road every evening at St@@ au when they go over the highway A@@ zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
the provincial road building extends on the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the Hammer street and the G@@ eler Street , the right track bends right by 700 metres .
drivers can then take directly from the hammer road to the right .
the big advantage : the traffic divi@@ des early , so that the total procedure will be improved on the multiple Section of the Federal Road 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the district of Münster @-@ West .
the driving force on the zu@@ br@@ inger is anno@@ ying the drivers above all between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
the back@@ stage goes back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her way and sometimes even beyond .
this is the eye of the eye on the B 51 at the L@@ eler Street .
from here , traffic will only be vac@@ ated on the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be built about three @-@ four@@ ths ago .
the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge has no longer load the required load force , to absorb the heavy duty of heavy traffic .
how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the inter@@ viewed St@@ au is going to take over , the state has no right to say .
however , with years to expect : for the bridge has an official rest of residual use until 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the right side of the law , the state has been deliber@@ ately seeking the public holidays in school holidays because with disabilities .
the traffic will be held on Tuesday and Wednesday at the site .

rain instead of stars : hope for weather maintenance
the weather has made the stars in the southwest of Germany in the southwest of Germany in the night to Friday a stag@@ rich - yet there are hope .
the night was not well suited for clouds and rain , the sky post@@ p@@ el said , the chairman of the Observatory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be well , then we will see many stell@@ ations in the sky .
the stars are Per@@ ei@@ den , which belong to the fastest con@@ stell@@ ations with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour .
they have their names , because they apparently come out of the constellation Per@@ se@@ us , which is in nor@@ theastern China .
relaxing night : tips against sleeping disorders
in the evening you can stand for ever@@ more , at night , one lies hours , in the morning , is already far ahead of the wake @-@ so@@ unding sounds not to think of sleep .
this is all other than relaxing .
after all , one is with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , approximately one quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent will find their sleep frequent or permanently as non @-@ recovery .
how do sleeping problems or sleep disorders ?
there are several forms of sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces , and there can be many causes of many causes , emphas@@ izes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ e@@ ß , member of the German Society for bedrooms and sleep medicine .
however , what is under@@ stand@@ ably under@@ stands , but the In@@ som@@ nia is never under@@ gone , thus an in@@ let and sleep distur@@ bing .
just across the sleep , many people are considered uns@@ at@@ is@@ ily or in@@ adequate , Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht is a member of the German house medical association with practice in the Lower Saxony .
what &apos;s behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
any other , organic , psychological or behavi@@ oral factors can be found on any other hand , but also medicines .
not rare is the dis@@ rup@@ tive expression of a different condition .
&quot; very early awak@@ ening is especially in depression , &quot; says We@@ e@@ ß .
and it can be that different factors require one to one .
whoever has her@@ ni@@ ated a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can be bad , wake up every two to three hours , and starts to gre@@ et over all day problems and care to gre@@ et , gives a example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is not possible .
when should I take care of doctor ?
if you don &apos;t sleep over a period of one month in at least three nights per week , should be imp@@ aired , then the doctor should be av@@ eng@@ ed .
the impair@@ ment can look different , one is beaten , tired , un@@ hat@@ ched , has difficulties with the attention and the concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical dis@@ comfort such as stomach or head@@ aches .
to alle@@ vi@@ ate the bed@@ disorder , it is important to find out their causes .
as treatment options , a cogn@@ itive behavi@@ oral care or medication - classic sleep tablets just in the exceptional case and maximum for two weeks - in@@ question .
in Germany , he is hardly available in Germany , emphas@@ izes Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the inter@@ disciplinary or medical centre of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
therefore you should first apply with sleeping difficulties to the hom@@ ologation , then obli@@ que We@@ e@@ ß .
he can clari@@ fy whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should happen to sleep laboratory , and what happens ?
for exam@@ ining the examination in sleep laboratory , for example with s@@ nor@@ ing with respir@@ atory ti@@ di@@ bility , in sleep conver@@ gence , or if you cannot find the cause of a le@@ as@@ le@@ pro@@ sy , Fi@@ etze explained .
it is not necessary to prepare for the examination .
one should spend the day normal .
&quot; only do not make a lun@@ ch@@ ap , &quot; says Fi@@ eller .
after glu@@ ing , one goes into bed at its normal time .
in addition to the electrodes in the body you carry a no@@ g@@ br@@ ille , a chest strap and a f@@ üh@@ ler on his finger .
in addition , a camera is characterized by a blan@@ ket on the ceiling .
how can I get problems in the handle ?
there are rather many locking screws , where you can set a better sleep for a better sleep .
We@@ e@@ ß counts on : regular sleep and standing times , not too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , don &apos;t have to sleep on the clock and don &apos;t watch at the watch - then you start immediately , and that &apos;s quite and absolutely not eligible .
what the jung@@ le camp with missing medals in swimming has
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has been sold by Facebook to dis@@ appo@@ inting the DS@@ V Team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 , he had brought gold for the first time in Doha , and set up his first world record at the same time .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ let Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has been protected by the explosion @-@ team @-@ mate via Facebook .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country where an Olympic Champion receives 20,000 € bonus and a ch@@ auff@@ eur kö@@ nig was supposed to tell about missing medals , &quot; the 26 year old wrote on Friday to Friday on his Facebook page . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the support system in the swimming sport is bad , the D@@ op@@ ing@@ checks are very good .
so , we can not compete with countries that do not promote very much and operate at d@@ oping on the topic or even it even operate it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls should be hired here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to launch a com@@ eback , D@@ ei@@ bler would have already reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping agency in Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
it is exactly how to keep it with countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who can &apos;t take a certain time before the WM / OS of independent control units of the WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A , may not participate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls for the choice Hamburg , who now runs a ice cream . &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : Ban@@ de of Bag@@ gage was arrested
professional Di@@ th@@ iev@@ es at Düsseldorf Airport
civilians of the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer Police succeeded taking place on Thursday the arrest of two women and two men aged 50 to 61 .
the susp@@ ects were committed as ban@@ de several hand@@ bags and luggage carriers .
against 21.@@ 30 p.m. , civil servants realized in the Airport Düsseldorf Airport , a banana which was known for polic@@ emen from last attempted theft .
the two women and two men had committed several Del@@ ic@@ t since mid @-@ July this year and were particularly professional , working and particularly professional .
the specialists of the crime Com@@ miss@@ ariat 34 can meet the di@@ versi@@ fication of criminal off@@ ences to Germany , following four acts .
they had explo@@ ited more than 15.000 euros in total .
old buildings , a few plain trees , in between even a rest head@@ stone pav@@ ement : the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain works on the first sight , but the police counts them to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
if you go along the east to the west , you pass at playing places , a refresh@@ ing child garden and a bi@@ ol@@ ades .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to the facade of a grey house , someone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
opposite a Li@@ dl , which is to be demolished soon , it will be built : until 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be created here .
article about this &quot; trendy district , &quot; as the competent property company Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain , are illustrated in the last weeks , however , preferred by burning cars .
the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents are occupied , but in the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , the Berlin Interior , held several times for a tough approach by the police against the project , the area known as &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the base of autonomous violence .
after on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schm@@ ie@@ de , with 300 police officials were cleared , with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site , locked parts of the road and kept visitors to enter the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile , the newly renovated building worker was commissioned by the unknown house@@ owner &apos;s rooms .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administ@@ rative Court decided that the clearance was illegal , and a day later , police and construction workers led under the Ju@@ bel of sympath@@ izers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the road acts peace@@ fully : parents go with children , people sit on the brush in front of the houses in the sun , others talk about pre@@ lu@@ ent .
in the immediate vicinity of the skin projects a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens are located .
the left hand is not the main concern of many people : K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in the Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who has been attrac@@ ting three children , mostly from the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the skin projects they share the care before rising crops and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it sounds not after a &quot; Kie@@ z &quot; who wanted to drive a majority of polishing protection from v@@ and@@ al@@ izing the left .
the tr@@ ench , which the inside sen@@ ator and the police , make up between the house and their neigh@@ bors , does not exist so obvious .
Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional labor quarter , which also today has a lower average in comparison to the rest of the city .
in addition , domestic and these two @-@ born residential projects already belong to the &quot; Kie@@ z . &quot; in 1990 , numerous buildings were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire mainst@@ re@@ am street near the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the mass had been cleared under large police officers , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ a@@ er , and are still inhabited by people who had occupied it 26 years ago .
at the same time , the neighborhood has become increasingly become the mag@@ nets for tourists and elec@@ ber@@ liner from around the world : with them , people from GDR times and former house occupied its &quot; Kie@@ z . &quot;
this is also noticeable when renting a new rentals starting in 2009 , increased by almost 60 per cent since 2009 .
many of the new@@ buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : one recogni@@ zes it in the recovered discs or fresh@@ ly deleted fac@@ ades , which were subjected to dy@@ es .
no other street was mentioned this year as often in the words &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence . &quot;
a reason for this , that not all neigh@@ bors may be considered a problem that they are not affected by the crime of crime , according to body injury , according to statistics , almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
the most important part of the criminal off@@ ences make evidence damage , the ten@@ ds tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses .
for K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , which has been living in a rental house for 17 years , can be no talk of un@@ certainty .
what violence goes , they are weigh@@ t@@ ful : the people in the 94 are their neigh@@ bors who have not been .
also the famous burning cars give it right to the Rig@@ a@@ er for longer .
for the architect architect , her street is not a criminal record , on the contrary : &quot; here one can help each other , live together on the road and gets more each other than what else . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliber@@ ately drawn into the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße .
therefore , it was so important to know that the inhabitants of the city got their streets : from the police , politics and the media , in July all suddenly the De@@ ut@@ ory eit was loaded over the district .
but in the eyes of residents such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to be taken away : by sin@@ less new buildings in former constru@@ ctional g@@ aps , which have the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , the con@@ domin@@ iums , which are not interesting for many here - here are more people who are not so good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; violence and Dest@@ ru@@ ction I cannot gu@@ ilt absolutely . &quot;
but what to do if any man list@@ ens to one ?
there are fru@@ stration among all sides fru@@ stration , also by the police and the inhabitants .
for cour@@ age@@ ing that anno@@ yed over colour bombs , K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
who is moving , should be aware of that - exactly like som@@ eb@@ ody , who is moving into a pub @-@ quarter , can be easily compl@@ ain about noise in the case of noise .

Ur@@ bach : An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is a refugee assistant
An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact partner in terms of integration and organis@@ ational matters .
Moreover , she is social worker in front of us .
since July An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee assistant to Ur@@ bach .
the social ped@@ agog@@ ical system supports the management of the administration of Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berg .
it looks as a contact person for all actors : refugees , migran@@ t people refugee assistance , administration , authorities and else else .
RE@@ G@@ INE customer indicates that the volunteers are more than@@ k@@ ful to be than@@ k@@ ful , that Deu@@ t is now , the pleas@@ ures of Woll@@ mel@@ t@@ au , which has a problem above all .
so some - less mo@@ cked than rather to the multitude of w@@ ishing , targeted - meant when the administration wanted to write the job .
we are looking for an administrative power with a talent for languages and people connected with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work .
but administrative work is not their central area , believes An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , it is about organization , work with people on site and also behind the scenes and network activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been around for six weeks .
she has a 50 @-@ percent spot on three years long term .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the highest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine customer says that An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le Hon@@ or and Social Respon@@ sibility supported . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are large and small issues , organiz@@ ational , human and understanding issues .
new containers are coming soon .
it has been a serious problem since some time to find apartments for the connection p@@ ines which have been recognized .
in connection with the connection , the municipalities are competent .
you have to accommodate refugees in their own or rented rooms .
the cost of construction , rent or renovation of these accommodations must bear the commun@@ es itself .
the responsibility changes from the coun@@ sell@@ or to the community and j@@ ob@@ center .
problem : there are free objects but not every owner wants to offer its apartment .
the search has been designed for some time as very difficult .
de fac@@ to find the administration no private apartments .
so far , it was not working so far be addressed to private apartments , so Deu@@ t .
therefore the deliber@@ ately homes must be used , as it is so beautiful .
so soon new container will be installed in the washer .
but only with apartments it is not done .
a perspective is the key@@ word , Reg@@ ine client and an@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ ver@@ le .
in addition to a fixed lead , there are intern@@ ships , training places , training places , one @-@ euro jobs and hel@@ pl@@ ess activities for refugees and migrants who need to be sealed or furnished .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine customer .
many work in the building yard or help house @-@ master , do @-@ profit work - and motiv@@ ated and very ti@@ dy , as reported by An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
it hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external action .
this is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
it does not work only work .
the day require a fixed structure , say Deu@@ t and customer .
people ought to develop a sen@@ su@@ al experience .
so it offers offers such as sport , contacts with loc@@ als and mainly language courses .
professional courses are ra@@ r .
so you can jump here administration and honour .
it is centrally that the refugees get the feeling they wish to welcome them in Germany and welcome them .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
you have to explain the refugees that it just takes and you can easily bri@@ dging the time consuming , for example , with language courses .
those who think the feeling of evolution , could not be able to work in Ur@@ bach , do not work and be un@@ profitable , who will never be able to integrate .
the distinct majority is motiv@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , there are also , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people hon@@ est@@ ly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who are nothing at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work of Deu@@ t and customer is always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all that is already a &quot; Mamm@@ alog@@ y . &quot;
a difficult question : the two after recent events were afraid of radi@@ cal@@ ization , also in a small village such as Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what lack of n@@ ai@@ ve may like &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; a residual risk can indeed could and exclu@@ de it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sen@@ si@@ can be the hel@@ pers already .
these inci@@ dents are also subject to refugees too .
they had the fear that the attacks carried them out completely in ob@@ itu@@ aries .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer .
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so , main and honour must be given to the spot and in the region according to activities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they always have in the background that soon a new Sto@@ ß could come to refugees and migrants to Ur@@ bach soon .
Germany needs a upper limit ?
the question is clear to answer this question .
actually it is un@@ fair to place it hel@@ pers on site .
&quot; we haven &apos;t arrived in Ur@@ bach , where we would like to go , &quot; says An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
no new refugees , that would be able to relax .
RE@@ G@@ INE customer also makes a clear that the ur@@ b@@ acher was fully util@@ ised to integrate the existing people .
this is currently around 100 people , mostly young men .
but if people are in need , one must help them , both of them are one .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .
