<seg id="1">Clint and Trumps economic policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">In infrastructure, the trade agreement is to invest and the trade agreement TTP - that want both Clinton as well as Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential competitors are however, however, in case of tax and energy policy, as well as in a fundamental question.</seg>
<seg id="4">Differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a basic and more philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">Der, about the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep in doubt rather small and warns about how the state of the economy may harm - with tax and regulators.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton had to handle the economy and regulate the economy, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself would be different, asserts potump.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will go down regatting massif, and he makes himself strong tax reform with lower tax rates strongly - for individuals and businesses.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton said: the state has appointed certain tasks to open, he has to open the disadvantageous chances and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why the tax would be increased to the rich, she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">It must be invested in the must say Trump and Clinton almost equal.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic applicants in 2012 announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in infrastructure are the classic democratic politics and are rejected by the nationalist Teachy Wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">Thus, on Trump, we could still be parted on internal discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">Clearances are the differences in the energy and climate policies.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal plants and resilize coal extraction in the US again.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is also possible to terminate the oil extraction in so far as possible in the Parisian Climate Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">With its investment program, Clinton wants to extend the renewable energies with its investment program: "one country will create the superstructure of clean energies and create million jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will be either China, Germany or America - I want to be there." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - also at international trade agreements the two competitors are not far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the state-fish trade agreements, do not want to sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">But at the same time both do not want to isolate the United States by international trade - but just better protection against American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They are then to be paid better, calls about Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7,25 US dollars is a starvation wages.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump to do this question is not quite clear: once, he says: the minimum wage must be ront, then he says he will not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the coming months is likely to develop well around the control policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On one side stands Trump, who wants to reinforce the economy and citizens to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics hold on him, that the budget deficit would only be bigger.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton's at least stands that they want to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="2">Sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone, almost already for everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="3">If they come to Germany, they often have traumatised.</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a large kitchen, four women are sitting.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each has a baby, which is a year old at the most.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put her little son in the arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He guards with big eyes curious in the room.</seg>

<seg id="11">They smiling and kisses the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene works normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you're talking with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">She is the division of Managing Director of Condrobs, a carrier for social aid services in Bavaria, and deals with the subject of women on the run.</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are poultry.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in Munich north in one of the few decentralised women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January, Condrobs made up the establishment together with Pro Familia and Munich's aid.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was recently officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are no men as well as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a wax before the door.</seg>

<seg id="25">In her home, they have experience with sexual violence, forced disappearance, slavery or forced stitution.</seg>
<seg id="26">This drives it off.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "for example, tugboat demand a bottle of water a sexual desire is no rarity," "" "says Bahr." ""</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">Who believe that the end as soon as they are in Germany, tell me, says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="31">Too, all women in refugee often would be considered to be minded and worse offenders.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is that approximately 90 percent of women who live in the city of Munich, traumatised, estimates it.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "some of the children are not voluntary for sure." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="35">"" "" "" "or they trust not to speak openly about the awakening, because the shame is too great." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">Since they often do not want to help, there is more accommodations just for them, calls Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Bavaria, the seven regional governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the question whether they are using a similar project, as in Munich in their condition, reply some with no.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the Oberpfalz region and Oberfranken, there are so something in the tourist tax of governments.</seg>
<seg id="40">Even in Schwaben alone, women were not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, Press Officer of the government.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Central franken, there are several floors or own houses only for single-standing women and their children.</seg>
<seg id="42">The exception is Lower Bavaria, there are two central accommodations only for women.</seg>
<seg id="43">Also the "rights of women and gender equality" in the European Parliament is demanded that women have to be accommodated separated from men.</seg>
<seg id="44">In a study published by the Committee, it is said: "it is very important that men and women are separated."</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "Alliance of Foreign Ministers"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leader of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give up his hands and an official end of the eight months of war with the words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gilded Hall of the St. Petersburg Palastes in reception, I cannot answer me that Ankara wants to make this reconciliation in most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There were the towel, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But putting the smile took narrowly and it shattered very warmth, even for his restrained conditions.</seg>
<seg id="7">Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, said to him of his "loving friend" Putin - according to a report about five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to its old level before the crisis, but even better to improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day described a newspaper that Erdogan would look like something than would never happen something.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me, his enthusiasm seemed rather to interpret the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's bright, sustainable cooling showed that the government of Russia had nothing to forget.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first, which he mentioned in his introductory remarks: the surplus of a Russian fighter aircraft by Turkey on the Syrian border.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow from reaction to the time was wutentbranched.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin divided and accused Ankara, who fell into the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The promise was even bigger, since it was committed by a promised friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Vetropes will rebuild again and will not be impossible to be impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media carried out a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">Once it seemed to be, the Turks would bear the guilt for all the guilt.</seg>
<seg id="21">Most serious were the allegations of senior officials, that Erdogans had benefited from the illegal oil trading in the areas of Syria, controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has contested this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally this meeting took place only, because Putin received the excuse of the President Erdogan, which he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire is clear at hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan needs first line all friends who he can get, after the last month at a failed coup d'etat of almost his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey had also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motifs.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions imposed Turkish sanctions - in particular, the prohibition of charters, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number is dropped by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, travel agents and charter companies will be facilitated if the flights will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late aisle anstorm to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the state television forecast fruit and vegetables, as soon as the Turkish agrarian were imported.</seg>
<seg id="35">A report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows: "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional policy value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is wasted on the West, since its response to the attempted power of power was considered a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">In addition, the persistence Groll come across the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pivotal to move from the cool mood and to reduce the relationship between Turkey and the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">Russian President Obama won a bonus for sure that he tried to test a coup d "état for the chosen state of government in Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="40">That's good for Moscow is a self-understanding that even has a deepening anxiety before regimeism.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this beautiful palace at the sea adapted to Russia and Turkey, as it once described an analyst once described, "Alliance of outsider": two countries which are cast away from the West and are poorly treated by the west and is now prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still large differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The greatest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave the role as a peace of peace, but where Russia and Turkey had to support other sites.</seg>
<seg id="44">It might be a record that after almost three hours of first discussions on the press conference, they said that they had not striped out the topic once.</seg>
<seg id="45">The president of Turkey implied it on a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize this.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no unique consensus about it, where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostility - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO's member of Turkey - is certainly better that the two heads of state will talk at least once again.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to the Bank's Chairman of the Bank, the RBS brand is to be reduced to a Backoffice roller according to the Bank's Chairman of the Bank.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Royal Bank of Scotland will not be available for customers outside Scotland.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ross McEwan distributed the BBC to Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the global ambitions of the Bank.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Bank has been distanced since then, when they had almost collapsed and saved eight years ago.</seg>
<seg id="6">In this period, brand new RBS has used to protect other end consumers.</seg>
<seg id="7">It supported the international Sport with million pounds of sponsoring, from the Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.</seg>
<seg id="8">But now she has decided to move more national stamps into the focus.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland but will not be initialized.</seg>
<seg id="10">In England and Wales, all RSB references, its headquarters and stock market will change to Natrue.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Ulster Bank brand is already used to customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are other, smaller brands for private customer business that will get more significance - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.</seg>
<seg id="13">McEWAN has been interviewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in Inverness-Shire.</seg>
<seg id="14">He divided the BBC to Scotland with: "the RSB brand will be at our investment brand as well as to the brand, under which our employees will be busy, since we are now more to become a bank of brands."</seg>
<seg id="15">When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.</seg>
<seg id="16">I say now that we are not able to pursue global targets, but local targets.</seg>
<seg id="17">Each of these brands will stand in their own congregations for something completely different and our employees work among these brands with the customer.</seg>
<seg id="18">RBS has already said that it will not continue to continue its Six Nations Sponsoring, and that it will increase the percusability of various brands in his sport sponsoring.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "it's time for us to develop the brand of brands, for how do we focus on it inside (we asked) to make this a better bank for customers?" "" "said the board of Directors." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">It would have been very cynical three years ago, when we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and launched these stamps.</seg>
<seg id="21">But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think there will see many changes.</seg>

<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for environmental and transport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a position of the Kremlin it is that Putin has ordered his duties as chairman of the Russian presidiaries of his duties as chairman of the Russian presidiaries. "</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who had been deputy deputy since 2012, was appointed to his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">1972 in the Estonian capital city of Tallinn, he made his degree at the renowned Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the website of the Kremlin it is (in Russian) that he later became protocol of protocol and staff manager of the governing party.</seg>
<seg id="10">On his appointment he said to Putin: "thank you for your confidence."</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the most important role of the government to support your activities as a state of government in regard to legislation and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin divided the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked his post to leave his position and suggested to Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Persuade the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has been mysterious in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergey Ivanov was a long time of one of the close confidentiality Vladimir Putin and works as he was for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, who was broadcasted in television, both men claimed to return the staff at his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the logistic action for cameras, only a few of them are convinced - especially in front of the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the result of a kind of power combat?</seg>
<seg id="20">This doesn't know nobody.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official statement - that a man who once had been praising as a potential president, would like to introduce Russian environmental policy - slow on large skepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his comments on Putin who are quoted on the site of the Kremlin, Ivanov said "It's true that I asked you in a conversation with me this very complicated item - one could almost say - proclaiming for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it comes out, I've been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and Putin's former member of the State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), he was appointed Deputy Head of the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="28">As a Putin he called his name Ivanov as one of five people, whom he trusted in most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once it was accepted that Ivanov had to be the second term President of Russia in the second term president of Putin, since a third term of putting into the Constitution would have been expelled against the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post has been taken by another, near ally the Putto, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin was Prime Minister before he became the President three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The project's £1.35 billion project should be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the northern deck of the Queensland Crossings with the Viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is the first of four closing of the "stud blowers" that the completion is approaching by each of the three towers of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.</seg>
<seg id="6">It features 10.000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 traitors.</seg>
<seg id="7">The project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Keith Brown took a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to come from the land to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said, "This is a historical and symbolic moment for the construction of the Queensland Crossing.</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of a engineering drawing from a truly epic measures in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were alone used for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the shutter between the Viaduct and the bridge deck is a pagan activity that require extremely precise tolerances for the fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">In total, almost 79% of the total bridge decks are in their place and the last passage of the deck today gets in Rosyth a betongated for the deck, which means that the total deck is ready to be lifted to its place.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructor said: "the first closure represents a significant milestone in the bridge project.</seg>
<seg id="14">With this fantastic project, the closure of the future is future-oriented and deep construction.</seg>
<seg id="15">After installation of the last street-cover and its connection with the north-deck-deck, we had to close the existing gap on the North or country side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was reached by pulling in the northern direction bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and very busy activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive, because the Viaduct is 222 meters long, approx. 6.000 tons weighs and had to be pulled down at an ascent of approximately 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the tolerances, on which the team is working, they were tiny - on each side, they were only a few millimeters.</seg>

<seg id="2">The SPD and green mine: investors will continue to be much stronger in the future.</seg>
<seg id="3">How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">The SPD proposes a "action concept" in front of the elections.</seg>
<seg id="5">But war is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First line is about the question: who is supposed to build the favourable homes?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the SPD faction of the SPD: "we are interested in the greenery with the Greens: he wants to build up 20 percent of all apartments as social apartments in future."</seg>
<seg id="9">The cheap apartments can also be built in the holdings.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "however, the great signs of the Town Hall is, however, Frmann:" "" "how do you want to build private areas in private areas?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "we want to provide investors in such areas at least 10 percent, but as much as 20 percent of the apartments are build as social dwellings." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">A new municipal housing program that will cost millions of costs and must be financed even for incentives.</seg>
<seg id="13">The problem, so Frmann: "there are currently no agreement between the factions."</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wishes to take investors as a few regulations.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left hand has no hardness levels for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Regardless of what, the Bratmann, a disappearance of the situation in the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="17">Will the action concept have been implemented, ensuring additional tasks within the building administration.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the program is not completely missing: because the approximately 1260 new apartments that should be built.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how do you compensate the loss of some 1300 favorable apartments, whose aim is to run out in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">By 2020, there will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">To prevent this, the planner spokesperson Nicole Palm, should now be purchased out of the city now.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, it would have to be thought about to get apartments back to the price connection again.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">To get a blow to solve the problem.</seg>
<seg id="27">Because in the west city they run at the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments you could get back to the price connection for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: this would not want to do the owners, housing units.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because the number of social apartments in the western city is drastically increased drastically increases from the goal of the so-called flow mixture.</seg>
<seg id="31">A concentration of social inwaking in just a few districts is not to be given.</seg>
<seg id="32">The green is that it will still be a movement in discussion.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world changed.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenager and child did not go beyond outside, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time, on screens, was carried out in the last decade of many laments.</seg>
<seg id="4">At Pokemon Go it is about to get people from the sofa and to be active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was limited to the TV, then limited to video games and last on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore it's great to see that technology and outdoors will not exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">I have a course of course with the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that is based on the characters initially created for the video games in the 1990s (later there was a animation series, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">How many phenomena of popularity fell interest in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">Market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that overload the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon Go more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "just said the player with their smart phones after outside and search for Pokémons who have been pursued with a GPS, once they were found once again," "" "photographed" "" "(about a screenshot of the mobile phone) or" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the wahn and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the USA the game led to a considerable increase in steps that return the "average" person every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiac, an app for Apple Watch, who followed the 35,000 users, recently announced that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of people followed, that train every day 30 minutes, from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company doesn't know anyone who plays Pokémon Go - it only looks the raw data for the performance improvement.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public awareness campaigns to health, people want to take "30 minutes of time" to come "from the sofa," because many public messages to health are boring and to come from people who look like.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the meaning of sport can't be checked.</seg>
<seg id="19">Who regularly drives sports, reduces its chances to disease cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of advantages that is too long to run it here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful to Pokémon Go is that people bring to do something outdoors, making them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine, as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people close the hunt even new friends.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there are also mossless toys, which must always complain about anything.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it mean?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps had already been able to follow our activity as Fitbit earlier, they gave us no reason to play sports like this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new one will lose his maturity and use it with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, due to poker's success, there will be more games to unite the apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world and will help many people on hunting, active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="1">Why We Need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I present myself under the Frauenolympier in the Turns and the more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I've been doing so dominant since 1984 at every summer Olympics and the US have never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And second: these team has three turner, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren, Laurie "Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin colour.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jew is and Madison Kocian, the Cathokin is round, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team does not reflect the United States.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has the black and hispanic feminine presence at the forefront of this kind of sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the past four years the number one under the female gymnoses was an Afro-American woman.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year, Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">That shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">With the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympiad and in America.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez to be, as they were unexpected, but masterful gymasticroutines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won gold for women with an individual combined event.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We are experiencing the top of this sport, but we do not see gymnastics in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie struck all the same way as Aly and Madison, to create it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "Last Five," "" "because the next Olympic Games is only four gymnants in the crew." "" "furthermore, Marta Karolyi takes place as a trainee." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that Turns is an expensive sports, and Turner first can unite the first line in private gyms that will rise by parents, which will rise for training, entry, itineraries, competition and hotel costs (for the coach and their Turner and families). the list can be kept individually.</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these gyms are located in wealthy suburbs, which can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs, Turner has a whole training and that is a devise and long-term commitment.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, Trainee von Laurie Hernandez, have trained both their athlete since it started with the gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to be inspired by the municipalities of Audinny, young girls that are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a powerful and easy-to-reach turnaround.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gymnasium of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">At my events, we have offered free and affordable Turns in Harlem for more than 15.000 people (especially black and Hispanic), and national and international awards.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer high-quality gymnasium, who want to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Turns develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and fit for the spirit.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifelong benefits for health and occupational and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that lets thousands of young girls get to be interested in the turrets and this is great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It's so important to take part in the sport, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by the Holes of the Olympic World team and thank you that so many young girls are motivated to get their way to get healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministers had hoping to end the dispute over the changes due to the adoption of a reformed contract with the functionaries of British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistants, who explored at a choice, refused him.</seg>
<seg id="3">In July, Hunt plans were revealed to lead the contract, and said that NHS had to present themselves in a "Niemandsland" and every other deceleration for employees and patients may be harmful.</seg>

<seg id="14">Daniel Morsi, Director of the NHS employees, invited Assistance to the strike to strike the strike.</seg>
<seg id="15">Morhoever said: "working light measures do not reach the only little, but already loaded teams and service providers and prepare patients, care and their families only worries, need and break."</seg>
<seg id="16">In the last two months, we talked about to have been speaking with the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Health as well as other ministries with respect to the juridification and the Whistleblowings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The employer hoped that this continued positive engagement to other important topics - how to return, flexibility for training, training session, mutual recognition of teaching, training session, health Education, the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health related to compliance with the BMA in November, February and May.</seg>

<seg id="1">Reiser Ian Wright for a guide to guide his tongue to the dirty sites of Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">A British travel subject to the immune system and sausages of serious examination - by some of the dirty and most beautiful places of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and itautor Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, his course on a euro notes, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a rinsing bow in Russia as well as a public phone in Russia to provide the resistance to the immune system under proof.</seg>
<seg id="4">In front of any object, he used a Luminometer to meet and to show us what he is going to let down.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, that was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results in daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought, the rinsing button of a access toilet block, which was already used by thousands of others, mag can be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="7">In his journey through Europe, Mr Wright said with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria, as well as his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Luckily nothing was left, he left nothing more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright became known to test the resistance of its intestines by being travelled through the world and ate infirmities as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public transport to railway stations up to dishwrestling of toilets, the task posed the immune system definitely under a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he told us: "already as a child I was relatively unconcerned, regarding my health and I have put all possible things in my mouth, Earth, worms and slumber water."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the movie he was justified for his call.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused, was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His proofs showed a Luminometry of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">In comparison, the Luminometry length amounts to less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian lavender that he refused to refresh more than 4000 units, while fresh washed hands have less than 60 fighters.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the bacterial number of various places such as bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says:" "" "this is the worst thing I have taken in a toilet, close" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing of dirt than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I am unable to put here, because it is inside the inside.</seg>
<seg id="21">"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company uses Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria, as well as vitamin C and D, to support the support of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Validation Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and New categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we wanted to offer a little new thing.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating for watching and at the same time explains Probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We conducted a crazy brainstormings, which thus did we said "Let us call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">You claim that the interest of intestinal health to a global phenomenon is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead only talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a bigger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of the intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide information about more information on an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who led the directing of the film, added: "let me lose my respect for Ian, if he have tasted some of the things I have been sent to him, as the eky Russian toilet that will be shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it easier to bring Ian to bring her, they tail and others, where this was rather difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad that we have recorded some of these dirty leakages on the film. "</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by validation conducted by the year 2015, 84 percent of all surveyed said lactic acid bacteria, particularly with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58% said that they have at least occasionally products that included lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">Seltsames Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals will not receive nothing from the summer election campaign, and the tourists from North Rhine-Westphalia must not choose the country.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, they understood them.</seg>
<seg id="4">In 2021, the Parliament election will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin parliament decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">Because of so far it does not expect: summer holidays, heat and landing combat - that bites itself.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals that are convinced of the elective giants are to be on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="7">The most popular tourists, which are in the country, are on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not a native, but not allowed the country's day.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are practical problems: in the holidays, helpers are able to impose the posters, distributing air balloons, flyers and rub to the end of the vote only.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until the 4th of September, 2016, the election and last day of the last day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to pass, once again, the candidates have to pass over themselves.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say it at all, has just started.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition, must fear his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly visible behind the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting how strongly Neuling AfD cuts and what remains at the end of coalitions.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years of age and since 2008 Head of Government, makes an almost inconspicuous election campaign, you can see from his grandparents.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels across the country, spread Rosen and plauts a little with the people, as it did already be the legendary thing of his legendary Harald Ringstorff.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise, pasting has got cold feet and gives Merkel the guilt on the blossom of the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="17">Your refugee policy, you "We are able to make the" rise of the spear lists, which will probably be the beautiful office now.</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with their peak data, the Minister of the Interior Lorenz Caffier, has experienced, as it is, if you're doing a right place in the right place.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has invited two Chancellor Angela Merkel to grandfather; Merkel's German Bundestag is in the northeast.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree that there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg-Westphalia and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "there was probably the majority from other federal states" "" "accused Vincent Kokert, General Secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in NDR." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But there too bad anyone from other corners of Germany, once Angela Merkel can hear.</seg>
<seg id="23">Otherwise the North East-CDU do not renounced the usual election conference on market courses and shopping malls with umbrellas and air balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">This, that costumbled, plays only a "minor role."</seg>
<seg id="25">The union also noted that in the country you feel the base, it has to be very severe, to meet again a wire to the people.</seg>
<seg id="26">It is like the left, the SPD, the green: there hardly exists in the times of the country.</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the Council of the CDU electorate Kokert to his fellowites is also selfere: "they are going to go where people are: Dorffest, Golden weddings, every birthday party must be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">Because much on the game, Sellering has set up its SPD in a particularly committed election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In surveys, Socialists and Democrats last with 22 per cent behind partners CDU (25) and just just just before AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">In the election of 2011, the SPD still won 35.6 percent in front of the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The green, small party with seven percent in polls, could be made to the leap into the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern way out of the holidays needs a modern Tugend and create a large number of seats on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"online campaign" is called the National leader Claudia Müller.</seg>
<seg id="34">Otherwise, green ballasts look forward to track search for locals for locals under the holidays.</seg>
<seg id="35">Silke Gajek, the Spitzovandidatin, curvt straight with a house boat through the Mecklenburg Lake of Mecklenburg and finds it still nice.</seg>
<seg id="36">Your impression: "election holidays in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is no penalty."</seg>

<seg id="2">Lonely men to love middle age.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before joining the commentary part, in order to overseduce it under the pseudonym NonAlleadsampler-age with harsh surfaces, this statement will be derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the most important reformation of sound plates do not want to welcome a boom in millennials, who want to welcome the reimitation of physical objects, but due to the Midlife Nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently bought a record are all foresight according to the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">Indeed, the age group of 18-24 is the most likely fleas group.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also no Horses by hobbylers - it has a emotional meaning: older record players retain their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it alone (69% vs 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog would be a message report in television, the camera would follow me while I walk in the midst of a busy street in Soho, a modest food suit and wild gesture, before I stop my hands and some best torial words like: "so, let's throw us a closer look."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's throw us a look.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart of SoHos is slow to its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the building in which once an independent seller had been resident - there is a handful of fantastic record shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the camera's camera to switch the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to estimate its age and mind through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three men mean age) into the Reckless Records (data number: eight men middle age, a woman, probably around the 20), is one day for a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill a few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is it a Collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess" I guess "he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">This record plates, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I'm not followed after I), clothe walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he owns such considerable number of albums and singles, is the outcome of its available income: it is now able to buy loads that he could not afford to buy those who sold it when he was young and plea.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy, are from the late 60s, early 70s, which appeared, when I was 11 or 12. things, where I thought something too young to buy them," says he.</seg>
<seg id="20">He is true that those who purchase records are rather reverted and gladly spend time alone, and add: "I smoke not and I drink not much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my master.</seg>
<seg id="22">Wez, 25 who works at Sister Ray, believes that many customers that he hits the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he also noticed a new wave of people who are affected by the Medienhpe, people who have heard about the comeback and have seen again to buy their old sheets again.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of the discussions that I have led, people usually have taken care of their collection during the period of 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their sheets sold to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records. "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">That would explain the boom on annexes of the revised sheet of a particular age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional significance of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a shop such as phonica to detect that the record business offers a soothing community of parables.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to Wez, some of the older clients attended the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans were overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to withdraw the stability of trusted record sleeves, return of objects, who can watch the happenings.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think, sometimes it can be the colt or owned material property as a kind of comfort," says Wez.</seg>
<seg id="32">That is with me as a collectors and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social worker!" "" "a lot of staff from one record stack." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey by ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who have bought a record they have not yet heard.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record players who never use it, while 7% of those who purchase a plate, don't own record players.</seg>
<seg id="37">At that time of the report, I would probably look very concerned, while I had a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works with sounds of the Universe (Number of males: three men mean age) has noticed a "Trophy aspect of the Revival."</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "someone just returned here and said," "" "I have no record players, but I would like to buy a radiohead sound top that I can put them to the shelf." "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happen.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less instruments.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I have no record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">Those are younger people, not older, who just come to slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which has dedicated the sound level almost a whole floor, has a blower audience, than I drain.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around 70, tourists who do photos, teenagers and women's middle age.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat more relaxed than in the aforementioned stores - Wild Beasts of the latest synthesizi and sextruckter Pop rather than from experimental jazz is it good to see such a diversity in the customer.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them sees strange women, but nursing psychmatic traumatic are difficult to determine if you stand for about 30 seconds long next to someone else.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been around for some minutes at the business and viewed the Varietaker of the sheets available for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It makes even more mannequins bumps than a big buy.</seg>
<seg id="50">They don't deserve a lot, therefore, it is not a real option, says it.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs too much.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to listen to music from a computer or to other way, but the beauty of plates is... "they drives with a sweet sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it is really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that said that a new generation of record lovers is to have inspired: urban outcasts.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I give the ticket to pattern jeans-Hotpants, I observe a group of young teenager who grouped for a moment of Polaroid cameras, before a father and daughter is superior to buy a Crosley record players.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left there is a staircase, a wall full of sheets of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a blend of contemporary music and classics which essential records for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one sees her - perhaps because they are only pure decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to deal with them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "plate art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that any attraction for these objects mean more money for the industry, and some clients could send to the depths SoHos for more, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, even the one that is most suitable for luxury objects like boards.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if my research shows that the results of Youthv vote, they leave, at least in record shops in Soho, the large number of female collectors in the reality, shops and in Onlineforums exist untaken into account.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They don't spend their Thursday morning with security not with plumbles by record shops of Berwick Street and leaves through boards, while at the staring view of an unsecret, 30-year-old fascator avoiding women's shoulders nothing shrink over the shoulders of middle age.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected an offer of the authorities in Calais, dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, in which thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">In case of a trial, the authorities argued the authorities in Calais that the state should be suckled to 72 improvising shops in which people sell within the warehouse, of cigarettes to Energydrinks, sell, hairdressing services, or tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or easy meals for a few Euro in provisional restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Calais prefecture argued that these places should be ripped down because they would be paid a parallel economy, that no taxes would be paid and the risk of fire and sanitation risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups distributed the dish that shops and restaurants are important as the free meals that are offered by the state-supported association and other groups, not enough food for growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also led out that the provisional shops and restaurants often have a lot and free meals for people in distress.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who operate 72 improvising businesses, but dreamed that the concerns of Calais "prefecture are absolutely nocable."</seg>
<seg id="8">The judge Jean-François Molla said that the grocery stores, cafes and restaurants will play a lot more role than people who live in extremely prestige conditions. "</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas of quiet meeting between refugees and volunteers offer.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places that was threatened by defeats was the Jungle Book Kids'Café des stock, which is a non-profit and 200 meals a day, English and French lessons, as well as an advice on asylum procedures for the hundreds of protection needy, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170.000 people signed the petition to get the Kids' Café.</seg>
<seg id="12">In a letter to the Guardian's name it was said that the closure "for these children were a catastrophe, of which the youngest is eight years old."</seg>
<seg id="13">The two aid agencies Help Refugees and L'Auberge of Migrants estimates on Friday that the number of people in the jungle camp has risen to over 9,000 people - the highest number is now - after a steep rise of newcomers during the summer.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Great Britain in the 7-day Rugby came in the final on Thursday evening at a rupted stop at the last hurdle when they were defeated by 43-7 in the Deodoro stage here in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji divided a master class in the handling, side-stepping, back of the line, line-up and roar strength to win gold - their first Olympic Medal of each color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat of the silver medal has failed to pass through the silver medal - Great Britain's fourth to that day - and they could definitely be proud of their efforts in which they struck New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The distinct defeat of the boat, 7-5 in the semi-final day on the same day could fall back in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But irrespective of these, Fiji would have defeated a 15-man team in the form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be for GB a consolation - but it will probably not be - that at least one Brit will hang tomorrow a gold medal around his neck: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, former chef for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind him.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game with Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">They just lost one thing here.</seg>
<seg id="11">This loop is weary, but the progress is astonishing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started wonderful and left the attacks of GBS from Spass.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt like the Kapitän Tom Mitchell and Co. in Co., when the World Series winners went down 5-0 to the above, when Osea Kolinisau went up into the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With another four minutes playing time Jerry Tuwai added another attack out of the right corner, which he turned.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly gained the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A little gate of Mitchell stop the mountain of Mann Leone Nakarawa in a third goal but it has only stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute Jasa Veremalua placed a touch down in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new since the revival and there was still about a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou convinces by a further weak tacklings of the GB teams and stormed up until the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is so, when Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB still had been added.</seg>
<seg id="22">So it is also.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB led basic changes to half time through and closed the fijianic gap... for the whole four minutes, which was good for the ratios of the first half-time, until Joshua finished Tuisova after a Brilliant stopplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton launched an attempt on GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went long in favor of the South Africa, whose fans sang and dancing at the grandstand.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the game of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Vilize replaced the i-dot with another attempt in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Pruff-önte, when Fijis rearmed and destroyed, destroy them in the lawn.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the day Fiji Japan defeated 20-5 in semi-finals and the United Kingdom pushed South Africa into a tight semmatch match from the race - Great Britain conversion of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown launched the boat in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive floor work and achieved a gate among the post in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliantly late Tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of English 15-Aside teams, secured the winning - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning by fight with cancer of the trainers to rowing</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no emotional Gold as with these games and what will be called.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first rash to the last, 220 hard Hieve that enters in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning finding an additional meaning in its golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though it was only those who were sitting on the ruder, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainer Robin Williams was present always at the second Olympic champion in a row without tax rebels, the first women in history of the British Sports, who made a scale of such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Its dominance was absolutely, after all of their 39,ated unconditional use, which is also exemplary.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant Athletes which slides over the surface with the elegance of swelling, which does not reflect the nature of the Triumphal Triomphe.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in the rowing is a battalion of content helping to make the difference and it was no one useful than the trainer, who didn't know this day before 30 months ago, when he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said, he risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer, which is operational and they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you don't do that, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a rather serious situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It's a little the view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Trio was lucky that he could begin in early 2014, out of season, could begin the interruption to a minimum, if it is the right term under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to get better again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was a incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in hospital and ran on station around - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet to a time when they said that some steps would be enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing is already a challenge, but this makes it a bigger one.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the infertility of the victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who had a nerstriped morning with a little more than anything else and trying to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">Stanning who was the centurion at the Royal Artillery Regiment in Afghanistan, said "I was this week an emotional wreck. that's maybe something extremely, but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">It is only repeated that how much I and Helen and also did Robin have worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin, we are nobody, therefore a massive thanks to him. he is the best coach in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I would not have a better person for trainers or a better coach.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have lost no races in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The pair had a hard rhythm, with which their opponents could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even during the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark they had caught up, Stanning and Glover had much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were trapped at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen: "lead in the process, lasting in process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important to get rid of it.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not able to make something rabies.</seg>
<seg id="33">We wanted to make no fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race what we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The pair will take a break for a year before it will make decisions concerning his future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glover has to appear next week on a wedding in their own with the TV adventurers Steve Backshall.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that my last race was.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have much more pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">In London, it took about six months to realize that I'm an Olympic Champion.</seg>
<seg id="40">It was all so new for me and I was so stressed.</seg>
<seg id="41">It took about four minutes.</seg>
<seg id="42">That feels so much better, "she said.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Singen has accompanied all her life, as young girls, she was a young woman in the school choir, in teaching studied music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"sing - emotional and physically," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and more lively, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">She is doing something very well with her health and her spirit.</seg>
<seg id="6">For singing is equal to several perspectives a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler from the German veterinleague.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most Seniors sing in choir and share the joy of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Irregular and nourishing social contacts can establish and maintain.</seg>
<seg id="9">For often, social and family structures averaged up, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">This experience has also done Ursel KTip in their chorus: "they will be able to arrange and to organize himself on the others and learn each other - a choir is a very special form of consciousness."</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be difficult in the positive sense, Hackler has to sing.</seg>
<seg id="12">For thereby, seniors have a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who calls his lung regularly, is not so fast in everyday life as fast as the dost.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even though it goes to sound the sound of the voice at the age, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">On older people, Singen often has a very special effect, Ursula Lenz says from the federal labour community of senior citizens.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations, the common rings had a lot higher point, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and leisure time, explains them.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often noticed that singing or listening of songs in elderly people often weens many memories, often associated with positive feelings of her youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">By song lyrics and especially melodies, themselves demenill people in a long-standing events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In addition to the singing, a special achievement is demanded, Lenz explains.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time they focus on their own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to other singers - this is a major cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Just older people who live alone, do not only focus on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition which you started through the singing in chorus, Hackler listened.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem is also growing by singing in chorus.</seg>
<seg id="25">Itself to show yourself: if I do long for something, I will better and watch over me - this experience is strengthening.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start with singing, so there's enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">If he wants to try a new hobby, it should not hesitate - even if he believes that little talent, Lenz is.</seg>
<seg id="28">You can't sing only - at 50 sing people who hears it, if a tone goes next to it?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of the suitable offer, senior citizens have different possibilities, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If anyone sings from the friend of a veteran circle, you can easily connect it.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many of the towns also offer views over the choirs in the surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="32">If you want to sing in a church choir, it can turn right to the church or the church.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior citizens can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">If anyone has access to the internet, the family, friends or neighbors can ask help with the Internet account.</seg>
<seg id="35">Who desire to sing, should connect to a chorus, at Hacienda Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does the soul well and has something fun - this is true for every age.</seg>

<seg id="6">"" "the" "" "identity movement" "" "is a group of French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012." ""</seg>

<seg id="8">Constitutional protection in nine federal states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - watch the "identities" already.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the decision, Maate said that his authority have voted closely to the state's decision.</seg>
<seg id="10">"groups like the 'Identity movement' try to pick up their target group as it is," said the constitutional system.</seg>
<seg id="11">Generally, try extremist, with youthful righteous language, often with poppiger music.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Islamist Islamists as well as legal guards.</seg>
<seg id="13">This is no extra advertising for the own thing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The propaganda should appeal to the people.</seg>
<seg id="15">Young people are susceptible to this particular way.</seg>

<seg id="23">With a view of the significant increase in right-time criminal offences and attacks on asylum seekers and Refugee, Maate did not speak in this context not from new terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="24">But we've found in recent years that it can give right thieves structures.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was the group 'Old School Society' or the Friday group.</seg>
<seg id="26">It may well be that further right-terrorism groups or small groups form the attacks against asylum seekers, against refugee camps or attacks from other right-wing motives.</seg>
<seg id="27">But a German-wide or Europe-wide control of spinal rorism is not recognizable.</seg>
<seg id="28">The existing groups were created on regional level or social networks.</seg>
<seg id="29">Concerned, Maate expressed that many overstorms went to the account of people who had previously appeared in the right scene in the scene before.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is the best aroused.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many of the suspects in attacks on asylum seekers are not known as criminals, politically motivated offenders or supporters of the right scene.</seg>
<seg id="32">"many people have committed criminal offences, who were previously treated with legal guards, who were perhaps politically indifferent, or for example CDU, SPD or Linke, who decided to become radical in the right of right-wing vote."</seg>

<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this filter is inspired, but some observers say that there is unsensibly compared to breeds.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filter tool, it enables the chat chat about 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identities in such a way that already borders the absurd.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>

<seg id="6">All abstentions will be presented to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Snapchat filter have caused criticism of the past in which they accused that the app Blackface conveys or white skin as a beauty deal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When this week failed to pre-beat a filter, who gave them slotted, false teeth and disclosed pliers, they called some critics of a racist cartoon by Asians.</seg>
<seg id="9">They asked if these repeated controversy has a larger problem, that the company has disparity with diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and the indignation were spread on Wednesday wide, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat, that it would have been deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an excuse: the filter was originally intended as a tribute to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>

<seg id="20">When one of Snapchats filters a picture creates, "so it is much more difficult for a user," it is much more difficult to see when it was the case, "the 25 year old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday Zhu decided that as a product manager and engineer for medium, Zhu decided to delete her Snapchat account, and prompted others to do it.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an account for medium and in a telephone interview they said that they believe that a cash-related controversy is reflected in the lack of practices on Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticised the big part of white, only male leadership and finishing its debut with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors, so that they can meet such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they are people with other skin colors that are working there, but not in positions in which they feel safe and feel good to say".

<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint that the Snapchat has not left unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company has no figures for the diversity of its workforce and has its status as a private enterprise.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday, the Snapchat on Thursday decided to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its staff, but according to a spokesman, the company has recently appointed a staff member who focused on entrepreneurial population groups and on internal inclusion.</seg>
<seg id="28">Zhu said that she will need her Snapchat account, and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it is not O.K.". "</seg>

<seg id="1">Amidst the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampolines</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, too late as it is, it's the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly and inevitable, a rascal relay between competition and struts.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is, when the Olympic torch itself would have a burning rod, which is served by the wrists to the swimming pool for triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You cannot listen to the TV, a newspaper read or listen to the talk of your neighbors inside the Coffeshop, without talking with Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the battle between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there are still Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a FrauenW with dimplets, could be well known among these known names, who can be sent to Prime Time, by sponsors and well-being TV advertising when he would be a swimmers, Turner or even Freal.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fighting in the Olympic trampolines around gold.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the centre, some in the shade are the sports fields that are not commonly accepted: air guns shoot, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the chest swimming and may have dominion long.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I do not make arguments for my particular lovers, then leave the attention to the discrete charm of the trampolines.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampolines already has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had made his debut in Sydney, it was the last 16 years so many that I had asked, not knowing that it is an Olympic Port.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional Ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes for competition, it has never won a medal in the trampolines and had a athlete up until 2012, who made it up to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prizes for the men and the Chinese and the Canadian women to share for women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their Gold Medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trolad jump has a certain outer side charme, in part because it sounds suited for a Clownsschule as the ideal for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a dgebundener enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the cartographic trembling of its never to end - but also the Grazie of the gyms and Tauri, the two sports, which combines it essentially.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means as much as "trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="22">Streak winner jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot nearly up to 30 feet into the air and must move a number of falling motions (turning, dumbbell and saltos) before it landing at the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">They will be evaluated according to official Olympiads after execution, difficulty and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Two-year-standing athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio each other.</seg>
<seg id="25">The joint Olympic Vektor is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists in their streches after gold further, quicker, downwards and beyond, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and back, downwards and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">You will not only hunt the finish line or the base wall, but also a further cave target: the world or the Olympiad.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal oriented streaks is the Nobel, admired, even fanatic, and it's enough to stir even a viewer to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I am watching while watching this games as something tired.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a reprieve.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampolines is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she pushes off, seemingly heaviest like an astronaut, goes downwards, then down to the top, then back then back.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a contest, of course not without difficulty, but during practice there is no hectic attack on the finish, no wolves in the distance, just the dreams, elegant repealing time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is so Zen as a contest for the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualifications and ducks of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will broadcast the final round as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympia-Manie they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that will probably see in general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase of consciousness can only be reached by the Angaffen and the object of male athletes, according to The Wall Street Journal recently, Mr Dooley awaits his after air ring, new fans.</seg>

<seg id="4">Witnesses say that the police have been killed during clashes with the police.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia straight to break?</seg>
<seg id="6">Over the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally to the western world with rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last months, protests against the government and the country continued to move in more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people killed on streets and requested fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The government was unmerciful according to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses said that police officers shook and killed captains over twenty armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the movement, the videos found about the protests that are probably from the last or beginning of this year, show how security people have smashed young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a hand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The chief of the UN agency for Human Rights now demands a detailed analysis.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "it was always difficult to join this country and there will be even more difficult," "" "said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populated country of Africa into Nigeria and its stability is estimated from the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and secret services collaborates closely with Ethiopians to fight terror across the region, especially in Somalia. only few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia economy expanded in a respectable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new Pendlersuit in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The streets are generally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia was all other than a role for democracy - human rights organizations continued to continue suppression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, with dissidents were effective for silence.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were killed into exile or in prison, or cast into the wilderness of the wilderness.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you suppress people and these no other options have to be protesting, it breaks out," "" "said Seyoum Teshome" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth has been Protestant.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation Protestant.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints, which cover everything from the ground up to the sausage in terms of power of the coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a nationwide election of last year, the regaining Party and its allies gain the last seat of the opposition and control 100 percent of the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, the tensions climb along the border to Eritrea, a battle for this zacked, disputed line called in June hundreds of lives.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analytics fear that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which were more or less than in the last years, to protect the turbulence and could be armed.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of debiting after years is now explored under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years many Ethiopian were able to communicate through the social media, since cheaper smartphones have been more common, and the Internet services have been improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government unlock the access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do in regular intervals, especially in protests, do many people still communicate over internet proxies that hide themselves where they hold themselves.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopian nationals said that they were so popular among the protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there are more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two major ethnicities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are no natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since Ethiopia, Amharas, who come from branches of predominantly Christian floods, in the politics and economy, while it exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and in Flachland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this does not change.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are to coordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests found in the areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which accounts for about 6 percent of the population, and which are dominant in the military, in the secret services, and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the rest is death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr Meles, a former rebellion leader, was up to his death in a non-public disease in 2012 for 17 years, Ethiopian prime ministers.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was regarded as a tactical Genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts predict that he was especially disputed in it, early signs of dissatisfaction and to use special officers to make opponents and to make them damaging.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the present regime lacks this fundamental genome" "", "said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopian new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen relatively unknown reasons to take the status of Mr Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Other than Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Southern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam come out of the South.</seg>
<seg id="48">The analytics say that he did not enjoy the confidence of the security services provided by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more blood shed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia had experienced a upheaval in 2005, after thousands of elections, who agree to thousands of elections that were apparent from the government, and then stolen from the government.</seg>
<seg id="51">While the following Razzies were killed, even though it were less than in the last months, and that time of the unrest went relatively fast.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia leader for their visionary infrastructure planning, as the new Pendlersuit, as well as for their measurable progress at the poverty line.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously, this is not the intensification of the internal misfortune of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes an ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">The last month of the protesters in Gondar, an amharic city, by Tigray, guided shops on and the hass across the tigray is more common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analytics say that protests like the United States and other Western allies can bring in a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as a basis for Dronenflights via the adjacent Somalia, even if she recently admitted that she closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want to join the ally-volatile area in a already volatile area.</seg>

<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump was trying to scatter the last controversy on Friday the last controversy, that his campaign concerns, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the "founder" of the terrorist group Islamic State, not serious.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification asked new questions concerning the communication skills of the Presidential data of the Republicans whether he is able to communicate and understandable with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings his fellow soldier who endeavour to take him during an eventful phase in protection to explain statements, which he could not be meant.</seg>
<seg id="5">After he had made the indication of a campaign event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump had made reference to the assertion on Thursday and insisted on interviews on Thursday, President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning sound on Friday Mr. Trump, he just said that he is simply Sardinian.</seg>
<seg id="7">In contrast to the previous day, Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he said the allegations totally serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to weaken the statement something that Mr. Obama wants to destroy him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy the republican presidential candidate.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism on Mr. Trump down, while he tries to direct the focus of his campaign due to failure to change the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches to the economic situation in Michigan in this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried again to return this topic again.</seg>
<seg id="12">On Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clint would lead to higher taxes, and that he has boring their speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already submitted a sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he moved strong criticism when he thought that the Russians should imply Mrs. Clinton's e-mails, however, he said "Of course I thought the sarcopic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to move the linguistic limits of politics and then return to rugs.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it is one of his ways to test how certain messages from his fans will be accepted as they arrive, and then, if necessary," depending on how the reaction falls. "said Ruth Sherman, a communication board, which observed the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I think it is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough, so that they can interpret it in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has an even corrosive tone, since its changeover are dropped.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was released on Friday, showed a lead with a huge margin in the federal states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-on-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is generally tried to apologize for his provocation, he accused him to understand his critics, or to understand his statements.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while being strengthened in the focus of attention in the past few months of its presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Purpose his loyal co-streak into the uncomfortable situation, regardless of how provocant may also like his statements.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, a former mayor of New York and one of Trumps celebrities, there was great effort to defend the candidates in a CNN interview from Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," Mr. Giuliani said he was asked to the correctness of Mr. Trumps. Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that Obama had been an almost unknown, small organization, he called it backbenchers, completely wrong and so on, because he absent troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream republicans attempt to argue that the government ministered to Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton had allowed to spread the situation in the Middle East under control.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and cast them out, on each of his words, to be reprobable and fought against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">He fortified the "poor, junurous" TV experts who try to understand and said, "You cannot do it!"</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the Democrats mocked on Mr. Trumps excuse only one further evidence that he is unsuitable for the presidential office.</seg>

<seg id="2">More rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland's disease usually come to a surface finish in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board of the research ship Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was born in 1624 and floats at a distance of 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland did not get offspring at the age of 150.</seg>
<seg id="7">In an hour it is just 1,220 meters far from the northern Atlantic Ocean, along the northern Atlantic coast, an average of 1,220 meters.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it comes up, the five metre-long animal accelerates to satte 2.6 km / h - and this top speed is half as fast as a seal.</seg>
<seg id="9">This loneliness lifestyle seems to be a sponsorship for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reports in the journal Science "at least one Greenland who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" madness, "" "" madness, "" "" Alexander Scheuerlein, from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock these life span which means for vertebrates a world record. "" "</seg>
<seg id="12">Indeed, the evolutionary approach believes that Greenland's disease is already long.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland's hair is difficult to observe, finally they live mainly in the polar sea before the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they are water-temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they dive in the surface usually only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers enlightens the lifestyle of Greenland's lifestyle as little as little.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her timeldest limbs can be worn as they were sitting in front of the top six animals with one transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="18">Prey do this sharks: on the stomach of a animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the pine bones of a young iron.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly they chase them sleeping animals or patrols at the bottom of the iron side and are looking for cadaver, that swings out of higher water slide under the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland, the fishers between 2010 and 2013, before Greenland or Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was only 81 centimeters long while the biggest 502 centimetres measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of animals, they analyzed the carbon-14 method of the shark.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens is already produced before the birth of the sharks, which contained in it later not renewed anymore.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had a lot of carbon-14 in the lens.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth should therefore lie to the atmosphere after the early 1960s, as nuclear weapons attempts to gain larger amounts of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In which 220 centimetres of length, the Linsenses contained a low surplus of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons, it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in his investigation in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All larger Greenland ones had a normal carbon-14 amounts, which arises in the atmosphere by cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 o'clock showed an age of 335 years with an age of 335 years, while the record-shark with 502 centimeters is likely to be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Grönlandhai-females first became obsolete, if it is more than four metres, it was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now, researchers were able to arrange the length of an old age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters is probably at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age at 156 years was determined, Greenland with a multiplication of at least one and a half centuries.</seg>
<seg id="32">This might be the world record currently world record.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusaleme live mainly in icy waters, is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland, where the back on the neck was captured a 120 year old harpoon top, was caught on Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to low temperatures, the organism of the living animals often goes to savings of savings.</seg>
<seg id="36">So you mature later - and alps slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals often are very large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume is much faster than its surface due to the animal warmth.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much larger than one gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>

<seg id="2">The future of the Aluminium schmelze of Portland, Victoria, as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - are available on the game since the system operator will terminate the energy supply contract, so that all delivery contracts will begin to split the supplier of energy companies.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step followed by the government's decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to operate the system.</seg>
<seg id="4">For 20 years the payout takes place in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 workplaces in the complex of Alcoa in Portland, Portland, stand on the game.</seg>

<seg id="12">The complex is located in the majority of a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp are smaller.</seg>

<seg id="14">AGL continued to say that the contracts so-called "hedging transactions" should be entered into force since November 2016.</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12 month period of notice, so it will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"therefore, AGL will assume that the contracts in the 17 financial year will contribute to the revenues," said the current supplier.</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impact on AGL demand from GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the high season prices for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL divided the value of the contracts already in its annual financial statements of $187 million in "anticipation of a termination."</seg>
<seg id="19">Alcoa said that the decision to book the treaties, the "Skill Alcoas... the melting has to operate or ensure the power supply to the smashed water."</seg>
<seg id="20">The US company said that in 2010 it would have completed a 20 year contract with Loy Yang, who would have entered into force in November of this year, even if it is still a declaration, why it has returned from the contract.</seg>
<seg id="21">Analytician stood due to the bad economic conditions in the industry in front of the possible closure of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">In reference to the statements of the Analytician at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland employs approximately 900 megawatts and Tomago about 900 megawatts.</seg>

<seg id="2">Heathrow is not only in our local municipalities and throughout London, but in the whole country of renewal and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="3">For me it was the biggest attraction in Heathrow, just as we were in London in 2012, when we had a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions are benefited from games.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympiad brought great advantages for Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And that will reach again by being able to create new possibilities for local and firms near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">For our local congregations alone, we will already create 10,000 new apprentices, creating 40,000 new jobs and prepare a youth unemployment in the airport environment.</seg>
<seg id="7">As they were ahead in London 2012, such will be such that the challenge of the extension of Heathrow is too large.</seg>
<seg id="8">I told me that England will never be ready for the games and that we will show us at the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The two flattens had injustice in 2012 and they are also wrong at Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answered them every question.</seg>
<seg id="11">As the Olympic Games is Heathrow for many and not for single infrastructure project.</seg>
<seg id="12">Expansion is a possibility to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion on witty growth, creating a legacy of skills and employment to both the airport and the whole GB.</seg>
<seg id="13">We have a great team in Heathrow, which has been implemented a £11 billion in time and budget, from T5 - the five years in a row to the world's best airport terminal, until the T2, which was built in the midst of the two frequencies test run of the world.</seg>
<seg id="14">Now they are ready to supply a third catwalk, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment.</seg>
<seg id="15">The London Games of 2012 was a great success for GB and I am confident that the addition of Heathrow will also be one.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is time that we continue to expand this Olympic spirit and create Heathrow and create our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment to be proud of England.</seg>

<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus from tools and algorithms to resemble those of climate research.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine if Venus with its hot, waterless surface and CO2 densities could be deposited on similar conditions.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously noted that the slow rotation of the Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have a thin, erroneous environment, and slowly stopped slowly.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet arguably pointed out more dry opponents than the earth, but had enough water and geographical variability to host life and protected rapidly.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus benefited from one Sun, which was 30 percent matter.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the GISS-model simulation, the slow rotation of the Venus regained its daily side of the sun for almost two months, "declared GISS Scientists Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warmed the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds, which looks like a rainscreen to drive the surface from a large part of the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degree cooler than those of the earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought a history of Venus, which resembles the evolution that was suspected of planet research.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was probably still habitable, Venus -- was exposed to much heat and ultraviolet light in the course of several billion years.</seg>

<seg id="1">One for all the cases</seg>
<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and everyday situations</seg>
<seg id="3">In the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little Coupé and even the versatility of a minivans.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sounds pretty good, but the HR-V, which has been constructed on the same new platform as the new Jazz, has actually become extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the only 1,60 m high HR-V is rather small, the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear, it works very narrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">The materials of the inside area are well finished and may work pleasant, only the cockpit-top falls off there.</seg>
<seg id="7">Versatile as similar vehicles is the HR-V at the storage box.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is not only a trunk of 453 l at high-sized and 1026 l covered with inverted back reject, but there are the "Magic Seats".</seg>
<seg id="9">This is less magically when it sounds: the seat areas of the back cover can be upswing like Kinoschair and provide storage space that is up to 1,24 m high from the ground up to the ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="10">The boot space is well loaded, however, the loading height with 650 mm is slightly higher than in the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-liter diesel engine with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">He is likely to render his work slightly quieter.</seg>
<seg id="13">The everyday consumption of 4,7 l / 100 km is gratifying.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is another engine optimization: a 1.5 liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">A all-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">The handling is balanced, a good compromise between dynamism and comfort.</seg>
<seg id="17">But the steering is likely to be a bit direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">The equipment is open in the tested Top version "Executive" no desires.</seg>
<seg id="19">The City emergency braking system is part of the City emergency braking system (operates at a speed of 32), the collision system and trace assistant.</seg>
<seg id="20">At times, the collision warns, because he evaluates many obstacles as "herannahing objects."</seg>
<seg id="21">The correspondence assistant is very reliable.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent Temporegulator responds to traffic sign detection and throttle when needed.</seg>
<seg id="23">But the full connectivity is only available for the top features: 7-inch touchscreen, Navi, App Integration and More.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB- and an HDMI socket are located under the armrests and are therefore a bit umerally stable.</seg>
<seg id="25">The approximately 29000 Euro for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">Those who don't want to invest as much will receive the gasoline engine from 20000 Euro, the diesel from 23,000 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="27">The engines comply with the Euro-6 emission standard.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening you can stand for evermore, at night, one lies hours, in the morning, is already far ahead of the wake-sounding sounds not to think of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is all other than relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, approximately one quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent will find their sleep frequent or permanently as non-recovery.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleeping problems or sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disturbances, and there can be many causes of many causes, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the German Society for bedrooms and sleep medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, what is understandably understands, but the Insomnia is never undergone, thus an inlet and sleep disturbing.</seg>
<seg id="8">Just across the sleep, many people are considered unsatisily or inadequate, Jens Wagenknecht is a member of the German house medical association with practice in the Lower Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="9">What's behind sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Any other, organic, psychological or behavioral factors can be found on any other hand, but also medicines.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rare is the disruptive expression of a different condition.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early awakening is especially in depression," says Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors require one to one.</seg>
<seg id="15">Whoever has herniated a herniated disc, can be bad, wake up every two to three hours, and starts to greet over all day problems and care to greet, gives a example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I take care of doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">If you don't sleep over a period of one month in at least three nights per week, should be impaired, then the doctor should be avenged.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look different, one is beaten, tired, unhatched, has difficulties with the attention and the concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical discomfort such as stomach or headaches.</seg>
<seg id="20">To alleviate the beddisorder, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">As treatment options, a cognitive behavioral care or medication - classic sleep tablets just in the exceptional case and maximum for two weeks - inquestion.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Germany, he is hardly available in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary or medical centre of the Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore you should first apply with sleeping difficulties to the homologation, then oblique Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="24">He can clarify whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should happen to sleep laboratory, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For examining the examination in sleep laboratory, for example with snoring with respiratory tidibility, in sleep convergence, or if you cannot find the cause of a leasleprosy, Fietze explained.</seg>
<seg id="27">It is not necessary to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">One should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only do not make a lunchap," says Fieller.</seg>
<seg id="30">After gluing, one goes into bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to the electrodes in the body you carry a nogbrille, a chest strap and a fühler on his finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera is characterized by a blanket on the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can I get problems in the handle?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are rather many locking screws, where you can set a better sleep for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Weeß counts on: regular sleep and standing times, not too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, don't have to sleep on the clock and don't watch at the watch - then you start immediately, and that's quite and absolutely not eligible.</seg>

<seg id="5">Article about this "trendy district," as the competent property company Friedrichshain, are illustrated in the last weeks, however, preferred by burning cars.</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents are occupied, but in the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, the Berlin Interior, held several times for a tough approach by the police against the project, the area known as "No-Go-Zone" for policemen and the 94 as the base of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officials were cleared, with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site, locked parts of the road and kept visitors to enter the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, the newly renovated building worker was commissioned by the unknown houseowner's rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court decided that the clearance was illegal, and a day later, police and construction workers led under the Jubel of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the road acts peacefully: parents go with children, people sit on the brush in front of the houses in the sun, others talk about preluent.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the skin projects a primary school and kindergartens are located.</seg>
<seg id="13">The left hand is not the main concern of many people: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in the Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who has been attracting three children, mostly from the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the skin projects they share the care before rising crops and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It sounds not after a "Kiez" who wanted to drive a majority of polishing protection from vandalizing the left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The trench, which the inside senator and the police, make up between the house and their neighbors, does not exist so obvious.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional labor quarter, which also today has a lower average in comparison to the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="18">In addition, domestic and these two-born residential projects already belong to the "Kiez." in 1990, numerous buildings were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire mainstream street near the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the mass had been cleared under large police officers, many of the projects were legalized in the Rigaer, and are still inhabited by people who had occupied it 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the neighborhood has become increasingly become the magnets for tourists and elecberliner from around the world: with them, people from GDR times and former house occupied its "Kiez."</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also noticeable when renting a new rentals starting in 2009, increased by almost 60 per cent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newbuildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: one recognizes it in the recovered discs or freshly deleted facades, which were subjected to dyes.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other street was mentioned this year as often in the words "left-autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">A reason for this, that not all neighbors may be considered a problem that they are not affected by the crime of crime, according to body injury, according to statistics, almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most important part of the criminal offences make evidence damage, the tends tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, which has been living in a rental house for 17 years, can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">What violence goes, they are weightful: the people in the 94 are their neighbors who have not been.</seg>
<seg id="28">Also the famous burning cars give it right to the Rigaer for longer.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the architect architect, her street is not a criminal record, on the contrary: "here one can help each other, live together on the road and gets more each other than what else."</seg>

<seg id="31">Therefore, it was so important to know that the inhabitants of the city got their streets: from the police, politics and the media, in July all suddenly the Deutory eit was loaded over the district.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents such as Neugebauer, the road will continue to be taken away: by sinless new buildings in former constructional gaps, which have the old inhabitants.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is a refugee assistant</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact partner in terms of integration and organisational matters.</seg>
<seg id="3">Moreover, she is social worker in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuschle has been the refugee assistant to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogical system supports the management of the administration of Achim Grockenberg.</seg>
<seg id="6">It looks as a contact person for all actors: refugees, migrant people refugee assistance, administration, authorities and else else.</seg>
<seg id="7">REGINE customer indicates that the volunteers are more thankful to be thankful, that Deut is now, the pleasures of Wollmeltau, which has a problem above all.</seg>
<seg id="8">So some - less mocked than rather to the multitude of wishing, targeted - meant when the administration wanted to write the job.</seg>
<seg id="9">We are looking for an administrative power with a talent for languages and people connected with a long-standing experience in the field of social work.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not their central area, believes Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organization, work with people on site and also behind the scenes and network activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been around for six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">She has a 50-percent spot on three years long term.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was the highest time," "" "Regine customer says that Annika Deuschle Honor and Social Responsibility supported." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and small issues, organizational, human and understanding issues.</seg>
<seg id="16">New containers are coming soon.</seg>
<seg id="17">It has been a serious problem since some time to find apartments for the connection pines which have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">In connection with the connection, the municipalities are competent.</seg>
<seg id="19">You have to accommodate refugees in their own or rented rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The cost of construction, rent or renovation of these accommodations must bear the communes itself.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the counsellor to the community and jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects but not every owner wants to offer its apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been designed for some time as very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto find the administration no private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far, it was not working so far be addressed to private apartments, so Deut.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore the deliberately homes must be used, as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new container will be installed in the washer.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">A perspective is the keyword, Regine client and annika Deuverle.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a fixed lead, there are internships, training places, training places, one-euro jobs and helpless activities for refugees and migrants who need to be sealed or furnished.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help house-master, do-profit work - and motivated and very tidy, as reported by Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="33">It hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external action.</seg>
<seg id="34">This is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">It does not work only work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day require a fixed structure, say Deut and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People ought to develop a sensual experience.</seg>
<seg id="38">So it offers offers such as sport, contacts with locals and mainly language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rar.</seg>
<seg id="40">So you can jump here administration and honour.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is centrally that the refugees get the feeling they wish to welcome them in Germany and welcome them.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">You have to explain the refugees that it just takes and you can easily bridging the time consuming, for example, with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Those who think the feeling of evolution, could not be able to work in Urbach, do not work and be unprofitable, who will never be able to integrate.</seg>
<seg id="45">The distinct majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "however, there are also," "" "people honestly," "" "people who are nothing at all." "" "the work of Deut and customer is always to motivate others." ""</seg>
<seg id="47">All that is already a "Mammalogy."</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: the two after recent events were afraid of radicalization, also in a small village such as Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "says Regine customer clearly," "" "what lack of naive may like" "". "a residual risk can indeed could and exclude it." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">Sensican be the helpers already.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to refugees too.</seg>
<seg id="52">They had the fear that the attacks carried them out completely in obituaries.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do," says Regine Customer.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "so, main and honour must be given to the spot and in the region according to activities." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that soon a new Stoß could come to refugees and migrants to Urbach soon.</seg>
<seg id="57">Germany needs a upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">The question is clear to answer this question.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to place it helpers on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"we haven't arrived in Urbach, where we would like to go," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">REGINE customer also makes a clear that the urbacher was fully utilised to integrate the existing people.</seg>
<seg id="63">This is currently around 100 people, mostly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But if people are in need, one must help them, both of them are one.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
