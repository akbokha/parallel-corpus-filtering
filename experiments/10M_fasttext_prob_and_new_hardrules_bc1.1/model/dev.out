Obama welcomes Net@@ any@@ ahu
the ratio between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not easy @-@ to @-@ use .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both of them wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as Teh@@ er@@ ans dest@@ abil@@ ize action in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the encounter was also supposed to express the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ states solution .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been curious for years .
Washington critic@@ izes the lasting settlements of Israel and raises Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of action during pe@@ ac@@ eke@@ eping process .
by the Obama , in order to prevent the Iranian nuclear programme , the relation of both the two further deterior@@ ated .
in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu had given an invitation to the invitation from the U.S. Congress a controversi@@ al speech given by Obama , partly as an aff@@ air to Obama .
the speech was not spoken by Obama , a meeting with regard to the election of the upcoming elections in Israel .
Professor at an emergency call to have shot at his gir@@ l@@ friend
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon speaks with a somewhat z@@ able voice of the police that he had shot his gir@@ l@@ friend and that the civil servants have to come to his house .
indeed it was important to emphas@@ ize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; but still alive , and probably he would be excited ; and he said he could find the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone .
within the house , the officials were called A@@ my Pr@@ ent@@ iss and a handwritten note that was on a white block , I &apos;m so tired , I loved it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who loved me . &quot; this was by the authorities in the letter , and he was signed from Lamb .
there was no evidence that this one who has travelled in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school premises where he was killed and killed according to the police , a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , who has shot and killed at the door .
Delta State University Poli@@ mark Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that the staff of staff belongs to the shooting at 10 : 18 .
he said that in the cat@@ astroph@@ ic emergency call was made shortly afterwards .
until the end of the day there was another death : he took the life , when the police attacked him .
a day after the shooting incident at the University , students and do@@ z@@ ers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to pro@@ cure a picture of it which Lamb is motiv@@ ated .
those published by the investig@@ ators at the two ends of the state published details , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped him to draw a picture of an talented , but possibly difficult instructor .
students said that they rejoiced in his teaching .
the police in G@@ auti@@ er , where he died , he did not do any history of violence or a criminal record history .
he had mentioned in a book written in one of his written records in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he divided his academic life .
they were both in the Department of Social Sciences and History , of which 17 members , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time there was several in@@ clin@@ ations to problem@@ atic behavi@@ ors .
a student using Bran@@ don Be@@ avers , the Lamb is saying that he seemed to be a little more excited and nerv@@ ous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mi@@ kel Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
namely , the Delta State University had asked for a ur@@ l@@ ur@@ king for health reasons and said that he had some health problem .
he only taught two online courses in this year .
the latest changes in employment policy of the University are important that the doctorate in those who had worked so hard for having no guarantee for an automatic way to an appointment as a Assistant Professor .
University President William La@@ for@@ ge said he knows nothing of the conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs idea . &quot;
these are questions that cannot answer any more .
after the escape from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ al lane when he sailed under Ar@@ kan@@ sas when he left Ar@@ kan@@ sas .
before he was arrested , self @-@ killed self with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson said .
his car ran still in the entry .
it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said that he knew that he knew the people who lived there .
ocean grew up in the area .
this began in 2009 at the University that has 3,@@ 500 students in a town with around 12,000 inhabitants , and taught ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he received his doctorate in education in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y .
one of the long @-@ term gir@@ l@@ friends ell@@ b em@@ bra@@ ced him as intelligent , char@@ ism@@ atic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said , she was 15 and Noah was 20 when they met together by common friends .
she and her friends were in the High School , and he was the cool old guy who tried some years to teach the guitar game .
he was the woman &apos;s s@@ warm in time .
all the girls melted away when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson city of Bran@@ don .
Lamb and Pr@@ un@@ izza were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; But there was no ti@@ cian of a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog called Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick @-@ house that adjacent to a Ba@@ you in G@@ auti@@ er .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the Ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ un@@ certain , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were di@@ vor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed in the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and her mother were absolutely perfect friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said that he never met this , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues .
I met Pr@@ un@@ ning , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail appeared three years ago on a summer @-@ vintage market .
later they played together with one or another .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter and sings her own music .
Pr@@ un@@ ning was a nurse which worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ keeper and sometimes formal Co@@ ordin@@ ator at The Jul@@ ep Room , a weak illuminated bar near G@@ auti@@ er , said that he spoke with Lamb and Pr@@ un@@ ning Night in the night 5 September after having completed his guitar and mouth accordion in front of an enthusiastic audience .
there was no evidence that anything wouldn &apos;t agree .
&quot; just a happy pair , &quot; he said .
we were at the cleaning and tired together .
I mean they had both a good sense of sh@@ ear .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialized in amer@@ ican nati@@ ves and colonial history , Don Allan Mitchell , a English teacher at school .

Associated Press authors Emil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story was corrected to contra@@ di@@ ct that the police now says that he had shot this emergency , after he had shot Schmidt , and that he prepared his emergency call such as his wife , but there is no evidence that the two women have ever married .

it was remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we stayed at the roy@@ als of the roy@@ als , and I know that the seat is empty beside me , so it will gradually understand that Princess Diana shall sit next to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a trailer for a forth@@ coming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

UN Secretary says , there is no military solution in Syria
General Secretary General B@@ an Ki @-@ moon says , its response to Russia increased military support for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of almost five years continuous conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen for millions of people .
the UN CEO calls again all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to un@@ ite and integ@@ rative negotiations for finding a political solution .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ an demanded the five permanent members to show the equal solidarity and unity in Syria , which they have proved to be demonstrated in Iran &apos;s filing with Iran . &quot; &quot; &quot;
8 change@@ over values that indicate that Donald Tr@@ ump is capable of taking .
some people tried to brand him as a flop .
others have taken him as a joke .
and some waiting for a collapse .
but it doesn &apos;t matter how some rep@@ ublic@@ ans are trying to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the top slopes in poll@@ s down , it did not work .
ten of the last eleven national surveys conducted by Donald Tr@@ ump in double @-@ digit range , and some begin to en@@ seriously ask what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of the real estate business .
of course it is too early in the elec@@ toral period .
no one claims that Tr@@ ump probably won the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts pray that at that time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys came to the rising of Herman Cain , of which there won &apos;t only won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would like to fight in a general choice .
but out@@ building groups like J@@ eb Bus@@ h@@ s Super P@@ AC and the conservative economic Group Club for Growth now realize Tr@@ um@@ ps stamina and start to overthrow their dollar in order to overthrow him .
here are some of the current survey data that indicate that the real estate is not only a temporary phase :
tr@@ um@@ ps of popularity have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced its candi@@ dat@@ ure in mid @-@ June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University revealed that only two of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans saw the estate business .
by mid @-@ July , it was 40 percent .
in early August it was 52 percent .
now six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
some three of ten that they have a negative opinion .
and these numbers are in early States .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa , last week found that 60 percent of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two @-@ thirds of the GO@@ P @-@ sel@@ ector GO@@ P would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; during a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C , 67 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans were either &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Tr@@ ump was nominated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only two out of 10 say they would be &quot; off@@ ended &quot; if he were the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son manages about the same enthusiasm like Tr@@ ump ( 43 per cent , they would be excited &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same about Tr@@ ump ) .
the next in enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters think that they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; off@@ ended &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the Estonian mission , would be the candidate .
a majority of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans sees Tr@@ um@@ ps temper@@ ament as problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ bers and cul@@ min@@ ating statements , 52 percent of the secret voters think that the real estate is the right temper@@ ament for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is in the first state @-@ state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans think that he had the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ in @-@ law , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent would think that he did not have the personality to make effective his position , and almost six out of 10 Independent exam@@ ining that his temper@@ ament does not p@@ asse on the White House , so ABC / Post Office .
Republi@@ can voters get used to get the idea .
when they place their s@@ ehr@@ ing , republi@@ can voters hold Tr@@ ump for real terms .
if they are asked to win who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , after a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C , four out of ten last week , Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
that &apos;s a change since the time when four out of ten runs their money to J@@ eb Bush .
complete re@@ location : GO@@ P @-@ voters in the past have not the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this time in the final cycle , four out of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans announced that Rick Perry would win the Nom@@ ination for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , a multip@@ licity of GO@@ P @-@ voters Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign is shown as pl@@ au@@ si@@ bel .
even if the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans attacked another candidates , Tr@@ ump is almost any of them .
some experts point out that the frag@@ mented field probably contributes to Tr@@ um@@ ps , while the anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is diff@@ usion to more than a dozen of other candidates .
but a survey by Mon@@ mouth @-@ University at the beginning of September shows that hypo@@ thet@@ ical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates who harvest@@ ed the majority of other Republi@@ can candidates .
he points ahead of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , against Walker 15 points , prior to J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Kas@@ ich and Chris Christ@@ ie 33 points .
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ thet@@ ical head @-@ head race .
a vast majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans says that they formed their opinion .
a new survey conducted by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of voters who support tr@@ ump , say that they have not received their voices .
of course , much has happened to change this , and no one can really say , never change the opinion .
46 per cent said they have left the door to change to other candidates .
yet , Tr@@ um@@ ps is the most powerful tool at the moment the other out@@ sider neuro@@ sur@@ geon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their opinion , are twice as often for pot@@ ump .
six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they agree with Tr@@ ump on the subject of immig@@ ration .
since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign led to Mexico &apos;s election campaign of two months ago , the immig@@ ration and Angel@@ point was the public dis@@ course of 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ ber thought out of Tr@@ ump little His@@ p@@ ano @-@ Americans will be re@@ mot@@ ely damaged by the Republi@@ can party and re@@ orientation the re@@ orientation effort .
but after the new ABC / post @-@ survey of Monday , six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans that they agree with Tr@@ ump on immig@@ ration to immig@@ ration .
so long as long as the immig@@ ration remains in the spotlight , the Donald Tr@@ ump seems to do likewise .
the fru@@ stration of the government climbed up to new high@@ s .
meanwhile , on Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , almost half of the support of Republi@@ can voters falls , especially through their out@@ lining status .
six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new Monday survey conducted by ABC / Post , they want to make a political out@@ fit for someone with government experience .
and they are also angry with Washington .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Bloom@@ berg in I@@ owa , two weeks ago , shows that three of four I@@ owa rep@@ ublic@@ ans are fru@@ str@@ ated in the Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five exclusive residential neighbor@@ hoods of Germany
here is the most expensive residential community - overlooking the North Sea .
a square meter of a floor space in the street is 7@@ 3,@@ 300 Euro .
&quot; on Sy@@ lt we offer the offer of objects naturally limited , &quot; it is stated in the study - therefore the high price .
a new study shows , in which particular locations have one square meter most .
of course , 18.@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich is not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top living locations , one of the price lists himself as pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate provider Engel &amp; Tot@@ o has released a ranking of the most exclusive German sites - with square met@@ er@@ ous prices in high del@@ ousing heights .
there are more ten@@ ths of a thousand Euros - per square meter , well noticed .

Champions League : Bavaria @-@ dream started thanks to Mu@@ eller and Göt@@ ze
double Tor@@ rel@@ le in Pi@@ raeus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has a run .
a happy journey by Thomas Müller goes to the FC Bayern the way to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at the Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ raeus , then ran ag@@ round .
a so@@ vereign reason for the Champions League @-@ 2012 .
the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario go@@ ze gave a dream started to FC Bayern in the Wit@@ ch chair from Pir@@ ana to a dream start into the &quot; mission Milan . &quot;
the team of trainer P@@ EP Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won her kick @-@ off play in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to gar@@ bage double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and id@@ ol@@ at@@ ry hits ( 8@@ 9. ) earned with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth start in series will be the first step towards the final on 28 May 2016 in Italy , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola finally wants to catch the H@@ enk@@ el@@ st@@ t to Munich in the third attempt .
in his 28th , Müller was awarded the Champions League for Bavaria @-@ guided mis@@ assistance from the Olympi@@ ac@@ os go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto who left one of the World &apos;s master &apos;s career .
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate that Bayern @-@ captain Philipp L@@ ame had promised L@@ ame fans in front of the game in Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is Stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 h@@ iss @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich held word .
they presented a focused and committed presentation , without sh@@ one .
Pir@@ ae@@ us had gained his youngest six home games in the Royal class , including its renowned clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 , Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) are proud to be proud of .
but the Bavaria , in seven European @-@ up du@@ els were defeated with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went bra@@ ve , in their offensive efforts , but often too imagin@@ able .
the attacks were often rel@@ ayed to the attack on the left side by Douglas Costa , who rarely passed the previous Braun@@ schwei@@ ger Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i , too .
more luck , Müller delivered more luck than his flan@@ k in the left upper To@@ re@@ ck in the left eye .
in the 6@@ 7th minute , the World Champion gave the potential 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half were Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first , as the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ stri@@ mer Brown is the head of the Pol@@ pol@@ o in Poland ( 26 ) .
then by direct withdrawal , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto and the kne@@ eling ground ( 3@@ 5. ) .
despite the Bavaria become a dominant game , Pir@@ ae@@ us could set a pin to pin .
on door@@ ke@@ epers Manuel New but ad@@ mitt@@ ance .
thus approximately , when he de@@ fle@@ cted a shot from Ide@@ a to the lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
newly founded Gu@@ ardi@@ ola a four @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who did it well .
Mario go@@ ze , after mus@@ cular problems back in the pool , sat outside .
the World Cup failed only after the final tough light , said sport managers Matthias Sam@@ mer said &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; he who wants to make something different from it , is already bad . &quot;
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola first took his change in his first change , when he carried out the King@@ sley Com@@ an for Lew@@ and@@ owski . ( 59@@ . ) .
the go@@ ze arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( 7@@ 6th ) and made clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ ton , Müller made a dr@@ au@@ ght .
before the game it was come to Kra@@ w@@ allen &apos;s stadium .
after a smaller group of partly avoided Bavaria fans in their viewers block , the supporters of hosts Pi@@ raeus staged with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went against the Munich tra@@ ilers .
at least a Bayern fan was injured from the stadium .
he smo@@ kes , has a higher risk to lose teeth
those who sei@@ ze you are not only the lung , but also the teeth - this presents a Potsdam &apos;s long term study .
good news : with aband@@ on the risk is reduced quickly .
smo@@ kers have an increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this was taken out of the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several staff members of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
in comparison to non @-@ smoking , smo@@ kers lay the risk of losing their teeth at the age of 2.5 to 3.6 @-@ fold .
more than 23,@@ 300 participants were observed .
basic causes of dental loss be car@@ ies and inflamm@@ ation of the g@@ ums , emphas@@ izes the DI@@ f@@ E .
for this perio@@ don@@ tit@@ is , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ize the authors .
the connection between smoking and dental loss will therefore go back to frequent gum disease in smo@@ kers .
not clear to how far smoking is increased the risk of car@@ ies .
people who heard with smoking could reduce their risk in a short period of time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
however , it could last for over ten years until the end@@ an@@ gering returned to the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers , first aut@@ or Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham .
one must convince people to convince the non @-@ smo@@ kers , study director H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking short@@ ens the lifetime of life . &quot;
not too smoke is good for sp@@ it and j@@ ars and leads to our in@@ sights even to high age .
in Germany , over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 have been affected by their consumption and divided by DI@@ f@@ E .
earlier studies had been pointed out that smoking is the risk of early denti@@ ality minimum height .
the new long @-@ term study has more than the findings .

in the vicinity of the site for the new Rhein@@ bou@@ levard archae@@ ologists have excav@@ ated the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ Museum of sk@@ el@@ eton and remains of historical buildings , museum manager Marcus Trier is Tuesday .
since the start of the works on the Rhine , hist@@ ori@@ ans are in search of the so @-@ called ground monuments .
in all construction phases in the city district Cologne , the museum is always moved as a expert office for arch@@ ological ground animals .
in the third construction section of the Rhein@@ bou@@ lev@@ ards , the arch@@ e@@ ologists were found there .
from text documentation we have already been known that in the place in the 4th century a fortress and the 8th century got a church supp@@ or@@ ated Trier .
apart from remains of the fortress and the church tower , there is also a cemetery with around 350 graves were found , probably one of the church belonged to the church .

EU Commission proposes in dispute over TT@@ IP News court
the European Commission proposed an extensive reform of the current arbit@@ rators &quot; intended for the benefit of spreading over the scheduled trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement .
the controversi@@ al private monitoring equipment for disp@@ utes between corpor@@ ations and nations are to be replaced by a transparent system which corresponds to more traditional dishes in its operation .
&quot; we want to trust a system that will trust the citizen , &quot; stated the responsible EU Commissioner Cec@@ ilia Back on the performance .
before , the Swe@@ de has decided to launch the proposal as a European negoti@@ ating position with the United States as a European negoti@@ ating position .
the German Government announced support .
the TT@@ IP is intended to emer@@ ge the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
plans to reform the current arbit@@ ration proceedings specifically see that the EU Member States and the U.S. will choose independent judges for a new Investment Tribunal .
they are to come to equal parts from the EU , the USA and the third countries .
for the first time there is also a second instance .
it would allow it to raise up the burden .
so far the process involved one another on refer@@ ee , a refer@@ ral option against their ur@@ ges did not exist .
in the discussion of the past months , it became clear that citizens didn &apos;t commit to the old IS@@ DS system in terms of fair@@ ness and justice , commented on cd reviews .
in the long term , it wants to work according to their own information on an international investment policy .
there , for instance , disp@@ utes between Chinese companies and EU countries could also be clari@@ fied .
the Invest@@ or State Ar@@ bit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) as one of the main reasons for the major resistance in Europe against TT@@ IP .
the traditional arbit@@ rators are critic@@ ized by himself as a sort of parall@@ el@@ ism , through the companies of the compensation of the tax@@ pay@@ ers , a national law , or cut a decrease of consumer or environmental standards .
in its first comments , anti @-@ TT@@ IP organizations such as Camp@@ act received the proposals of the EU Commission as in@@ sufficient .
a critical agreement was particularly critic@@ ised for the already negoti@@ ated free trade agreement with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) .
the German Economic State Secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) registered the plans by contrast to major progress .

Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ ns made his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Day
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns has made an increase in the prime minister of the Prime Minister since its election with Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns .
the new Labour leader Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n is supposed to give his debut with David Cameron &apos;s question for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will continue to settle the first of his six previous questions in order to cover his performance in the media , most likely , and the Labour M@@ EPs from the vicinity .
he called &quot; less theater and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could ski@@ p some sessions to ski@@ p his colleagues .
the encounter is the first parliamentary assessment of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s leadership , because she is a member of the early parliamentary group and following his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the decision of the Labour chair , on Tuesday during the singing of Britain &apos;s national an@@ them prov@@ oked the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , critic@@ ized criticism of a number of t@@ ory @-@ MP@@ S and stands at the focus of several cover stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision , not to sing the national an@@ them , has taken attention to himself
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that he had been suffering &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and got the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Sch@@ atten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , said in the BBC Two News@@ night program , he did to sing the Labour leader , &quot; independent &quot; from his belief that the monarchy should be abolished .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s top team , and comm@@ enting on dis@@ agreements for the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Parliamentary Party encouraged him to support him as a leader .
the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also within Labour &quot; and by Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s post@@ ings to the European Union and the limitation to threads .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ l said the TU@@ C Conference to set the Labour Convention to remove the whole idea of a limitation in overall .
hours later , Mr Smith , the shadow of labour and minister , said that the party is &quot; very clear &quot; that they can only reduce the government plans , the limit of 26@@ ,000 £ to 23@@ ,000 £ .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n is the fifth Labour leader with David Cameron , who since he is T@@ ory boss , has been across the Dis@@ patch box in the last decade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Labour leader , who promised another issue of policy , says that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ row@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for questions to Mr. Cameron stands and gave him more than 30.000 proposals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Is@@ lington North MP has said that the fra@@ ctions of the Prime Minister is therefore con@@ front@@ ally and that He will under@@ go both &quot; Schlag@@ eter &quot; and the stre@@ aks along with resistance , and instead has resolved to serious problems like poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle , the Shadow Economic Minister , will be represented if he is not taking part - for example when Mr Cameron is on the road from abroad .
he also brought the idea to conversation , that other colleagues occasionally bear the word , and that he taught John Ber@@ ber , the spokes@@ man of the house , addressed to the problem .
when he became leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he was k@@ not@@ ted from politics in the style of a &quot; cas@@ u@@ le &quot; theatre , who often worked with the wound of the Prime Minister . but a few years later he dre@@ amed that he f@@ ails in it .
since they were first sent in television in 1990 , the fra@@ cture was viewed as the most important Bar@@ ometer in the judgment of a guide and his leadership in the Lower Houses and his position among his parliamentary report , although critics ar@@ gues that they had become a car@@ ic@@ ature and deliber@@ ate re@@ forms .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is un@@ likely that this buying power will be the higher working costs in the same company , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost could also meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and this could mean that there are less additional jobs .

Met@@ cash kick@@ ed @-@ off with start@@ up campaign to fight al@@ di@@ - in@@ fest@@ ation
Met@@ cash tries to protect the IG@@ A branch before an Al@@ di @-@ boost in South Australia and Western Australia .
food whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers Met@@ cash kick@@ ed off a soil cr@@ ushing campaign to defend the market share of IG@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in ahead of a 700 million US Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepared its opening of two sales centres and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia in the next year , strengthen Met@@ cash and IG@@ A markets with local food supplier and build the IG@@ A brand through Main@@ stream marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events such as Adelaide @-@ Show .
Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as E@@ ish@@ ly Simm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , which sells UK @-@ shops samples and shop shares that sell well @-@ priced tickets for the South Australian soccer league in loy@@ al customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash results further details of its defense strategy on September 29 when the whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers ensure food , alcohol and devices through its annual Invest@@ ors of investors .
it is a lot at the game since South Australia and Western Australia uses nearly 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A charging business , and higher profit mar@@ gins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in the eastern states .
being in South Australia and Western Australia , buyers and IG@@ A retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia , compared to about 14 percent in Eastern Australia .
yet , anal@@ ysts predi@@ ct just like Morgan Stanley finally discovered that Al@@ di will move around five percent of the food market in these two states around five percent of the food market in these two states , but mainly autonomous distributors are removed .
according to a report published in this week , the Analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stanley was estimated that IG@@ A retailers can stand by $ 360 million a year and cash cash $ 250 millions by the end of 2016 .
this progn@@ osis is based on the assum@@ ption that Al@@ di opened 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA , which will generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and grocery store and at large quantities on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s high fixed cost could cost about $ 13 million in profit before interest and taxes , stated Mr K@@ ier@@ ath .
at the same time , Met@@ cash market share loses market shares in eastern states , mainly on Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan that IG@@ A buyers were the most important .
Morgan Stanley occupies that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s revenues in the food and grocery store at 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading F@@ ond@@ s@@ Manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , during a business food in Melbourne , that Met@@ cash probably will disappear within a decade . Met@@ cash will disappear .
Met@@ cash now refused to react to the comments of Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash has been incorporated with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ As market share has been reduced from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food retailers have fallen by 43 per cent since 2012 , which reflects the de@@ cent reduction of operations at the same pressure on sales and mar@@ gins .
however , the whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers vent@@ ures to improve sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products every week , while improving their shops to improve fresh food products and deliver better choice of private @-@ label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Managing Director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and load rehabilitation programs to Elan grow and hopes that the whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers in 2017 will return to profit growth for the first time in four years .
Tan@@ i Kok@@ kin@@ is is supported by the president of the Australian tennis courts Steve Heal@@ y are supported
than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deser@@ ves more praise than criticism for his behavior .
Tan@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; in the shortest storm around his friend Nick Cy@@ gios and earns his praise to the President of the Australian tennis court , Steve Heal@@ y rather praise his own behavior .
co@@ co@@ ak@@ is , the younger of talented du@@ os , which is always named &quot; special KS &quot; fell by the inf@@ am@@ ous contro@@ vers@@ y of Cy@@ gio with St@@ an WA@@ W@@ R@@ IN@@ KA among the Montreal Masters in the spotlight .
in a spring quali@@ fier in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after that Kok@@ k@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the arbit@@ rator : &quot; WA@@ W@@ R@@ IN@@ KA had to strike the cr@@ ush@@ es , and I shall beat the child . &quot;
while he was last seen as he was defeated a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cr@@ amp@@ ard broke up a potential US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , co@@ ca@@ ine was defended by Heal@@ y .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in competition with Sam Gr@@ oth around the second place in single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ finals .
&quot; one thing , over which I &apos;m rather awak@@ ening , is the fact that after my view Than@@ asi was a little bit into the dispute , &quot; said Heal@@ y .
he has broken up a ra@@ cket while he lost because of a cr@@ amp@@ y in the US Open , but he is not the first player that has a bat of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Than@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved very well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deser@@ ved a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around , he has a great family around , and I think he was treated a little too strict .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he fits into the team and so on , he has never been a problem with the other players , he is trained in the changing area , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deser@@ ves it to be judged by his own services .
Heal@@ y also supported the decision by the Kyr@@ gy@@ back into the important pre@@ limin@@ aries which begins on Friday and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right for everyone , but he assi@@ sts the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term integral part to the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and did not turn on all the controversi@@ es round &#91; Cy@@ gios &#93; , &quot; said Heal@@ y .
and I think Nick has made very quickly the asc@@ ension , where@@ of people like fe@@ ather and mur@@ ray . he asc@@ ended in the eyes of the public , but we try to think about it , that , in which he can think about it , I think about it , and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s the best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary explains Not@@ ice , closes the border , its refugees come back
Hungary explains the emergency state and inter@@ locked the south border with Serbia on Tuesday and kept everyone who tried to get illegal in the country . everything with the aim to stop the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed at the border , when hundreds of migrants re@@ acted to a lev@@ elled and Serb officials with indig@@ nation .
the people who fled before violence was voted for an unknown time in a stre@@ ak on the road between the two control points of the countries , and they settled there .
but fru@@ str@@ ations rose .
as a police @-@ helicopter over them , the Mig@@ rants &quot; opened the fron@@ tier ! &quot; and they cried out against the Hungarian re@@ conn@@ c@@ ism .
some instructed from protest foods and water .
Serbia &apos;s foreign minister said it was &quot; un@@ acceptable &quot; that migrants would have returned from Hungary during more and more from Macedonia and Greece .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral .
we have to take place talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; said Iv@@ ica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tur@@ mo@@ il of the Hungarian @-@ Serb border came to a day after the 28 Nations block at a controversi@@ al meeting in Brussels . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who had sought refuge in Italy and Greece . they claimed their hope that the next month or until the end of the year - an agreement would have reached more than 120,000 refugees including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immig@@ ration crisis of the continent .
but Hungary , however , didn &apos;t put his hopes for the early war of Brussels or of his neighbours .
the emergency department in two south regions announced authorities to assess the crisis in two south regions , so that they were able to cut down roads and asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs , Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ ar@@ to said that his country also had the construction of a bar@@ bed wire along its border to Rum@@ ania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country - after it has ended a fence at the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News @-@ Cor@@ respon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates were used to build the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
during the last months , Hungary is for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East to a considerable bott@@ len@@ eck and the entry point to the European Union .
prime minister Viktor Or@@ ban on insi@@ sted that most influ@@ ential economic refugees are , who are looking for a better life , and not war refugees , which are strong in contra@@ diction to other EU countries , including Germany .
the new laws , which stood at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 foot ) tall Za@@ us , who led the government along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also lay higher pen@@ alties for human tra@@ ff@@ ic@@ kers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the situation , which was caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the emergency state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Govern@@ or Z@@ olt@@ an K@@ ov@@ acs &apos;s Rep@@ orters in the Southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
we say it very much : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still agree to the use of military personnel , which is expected for the next week , but re@@ porter from Associated Press have been seen on the border of heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country @-@ security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that there were 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others were already deeper into the country .
they come by destro@@ ying the fence , they are now in custody and are accused of the off@@ ences of the criminal off@@ ences after the new laws .
authorities are to repair the fence fast .
in Tuesday morning there were two of the seven border crossing with Serbia , after a train ar@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos rev@@ ital@@ ized the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to edit the data of people and op@@ pressed a human amount to op@@ t @-@ up there .
about 20 managed to enter , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the most important motorway connection from Serbia and Hungary , said they would be nour@@ ished for food and water until they are travelling to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s lead prior to Ber@@ nie S@@ anders at a national survey
the former US Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton continues to keep a double @-@ digit margin in the democratic races surrounding the nom@@ ination at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins all of its territory across the ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters during the elections ( 58 percent before ) while S@@ anders is at the second position , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
Vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he was elected president for the presidential election , received support of 15 percent of the Democratic voters of the Presi@@ dential elections .
more than five months prior to the beginning of the election , most of the democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion stands , which candidates can support them .
but Clin@@ t and supporters are employed as one of the other candidates in their election .
since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton lost some winning groups in a series of demo@@ graphic groups , while S@@ anders had posted some winn@@ ings .
Clinton holds a huge margin of women and moder@@ ates , but this prec@@ urs@@ ors have reduced .
their support for the men has decreased clearly , and S@@ anders will only be back with 5 points .
Clin@@ t in democratic voters being below 50 years ago has pl@@ ough@@ ed , and they are now at the same height .
but Clinton had a great advantage over the older voters .
last month Clinton was with a double @-@ digit margin for the Liber@@ al , but S@@ anders has now a 5 @-@ point lead with this group .
about half of the democratic voters in the country would say that they would support Clinton &apos;s regime when they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some benefits and another 15 percent would only support them , because they are the candidate list .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps not surprising that Clin@@ t &apos;s actual supporters are excited especially of her .
the views are stronger mixed with those who currently not support Clinton - only one quarter would have loved it .
while 48 percent of the Democratic voters want to support Clinton with enthusiasm , less republi@@ can voters will say this about their top @-@ level data Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clin@@ t become supp@@ orter in an open question , why they want the candidates that they have the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman is President ( 13 percent ) and that it is the best can@@ did@@ acy for the job ( 10 percent ) .
in addition , Clinton &apos;s Clinton &apos;s support was also mentioned in Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
agreement to deal with the problems and the di@@ version are also quoted .
as the vice president cast a potential for the presidential office to the father@@ less , 57 percent of democratic voters want to see him in the race - though a third he believes it should not do it .
if the voters want to be asked for the party , who would be their second choice for the party is Bi@@ den at the helm .
of Clin@@ es App@@ endi@@ ces more than half , that bi@@ ds would have their second choice well ahead of S@@ anders .
decides , not for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s advance is increasing , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in competition at 30 points without him in the race .
five and fifty percent of democratic voters want to see Clinton as a candidate to win the election ; however , this figure has fallen from 78 per cent in the last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; bi@@ den is by far a second with this measurement , but the percentage that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; selectable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has increased . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , by the question afterwards , what a candidate is more important , social voters call for elec@@ torate @-@ friendliness .
similarly , as in the last month , no single demo@@ c@@ rat@@ ory candidate or potential candidate for those sel@@ ector already stands out as un@@ acceptable .
the Democratic candidate or potential candidates bring good results in some important characteristics at voters of the party &apos;s elections .
added opinions to Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as hon@@ est and tru@@ st@@ worthy and equipped with strong guides .
in the course of the three candidates , Bi@@ den inter@@ sect with hon@@ esty while Clin@@ t &apos;s starch is the lead .
thirty per cent of the democratic voters think that Clinton &apos;s hon@@ est and tru@@ st@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not have the opinion about him .
Democratic Vot@@ ers of the sel@@ ections will generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ological in accordance with their views .
with all these measurements , a quarter of the democratic voters has no opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions concerning Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term as an Foreign Minister , most of the country sel@@ ections are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and saying that their opinions will not be influenced in total .
but it is a different story in the American public altogether .
half of the Americans are dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only one third is satisfied .
the public opinion about this was in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail contro@@ vers@@ y did not affect their general opinions on Clinton &apos;s opinion , although 36 percent said that their opinion has deterior@@ ated .
they are mainly rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say that their views are worse by Clinton .
although Clinton &apos;s voters think of the voters being hon@@ est and tru@@ st@@ worthy , this continues to be a problem for them under registered voters : only 32 % see them as hon@@ est and tru@@ st@@ worthy , eight percent less than in the last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of those entitled to vote are not liable for an hon@@ our@@ able and trusted person .
at the same time 55 per cent of those entitled nationwide must not be tru@@ thful and not tru@@ st@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , receive good notes at a guide .
of the six candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush receive best at their best hon@@ esty .
a majority can be hon@@ est@@ ly rather than hon@@ est , but how in Car@@ son do have no opinion about him .
the error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters were 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son back in the nationwide pol@@ l near Donald Tr@@ ump on
Ben Car@@ son is home to the latest C@@ BS News / New York Times close behind Donald Tr@@ ump
following the two candidates , half of the support of voters falls in the new survey , and others stand dramatically .
Republi@@ can voters support nationwide p@@ ump in large numbers . it grows by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey carried out before Fox News Deb@@ ate last month , to 27 % in the survey of Tuesday .
but Car@@ son spar@@ ked the same period from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son in demo@@ graphic groups sur@@ passes well and pot@@ ump than republi@@ can voters with university education .
the rest of the field , except Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Govern@@ or John Kas@@ ich , is defeated by Wis@@ con@@ sins , Scott Walker , who fell in the deepest well , namely from 10 % support in the last month to now 2 % .
the former governor of J@@ eb Bush , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ sas Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are at 6 % on the third place .
the trou@@ bl@@ esho@@ oting with the sample of 376 persons from Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week , shows that Car@@ son continues to poll@@ s with 19 % in support of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , behind the ump of 32 % .
recent survey by ABC News / Washington Post was clearly shown by Tr@@ ump .
with a look at one of the last week , Tr@@ ump found a few side@@ th@@ iev@@ es for former neuro@@ surgery , even after Car@@ son has ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tr@@ um@@ ps faith into question .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump on Saturday last Saturday during a campaigns in I@@ owa .
pleasant swimming @-@ temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean sea is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even when peak values are measured only in distance , enough water slides come to the Mediterranean to take a still warm water .
a bathroom in the North or Baltic should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
today there is no more to the sea : the maximum of 18 degrees in the North Sea and the Baltic took place in this week , the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) divi@@ des itself .
some temperatures can continue , however , the Mediterranean : in the East , it even reaches up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic there are 25 degrees in the Adriatic , in France 23 degrees .

five members of the Brotherhood now bur@@ dened by the death of a Baruch College of Ne@@ ul@@ ings
almost two years after a student during a sh@@ ik@@ an@@ ous rit@@ ual as a student union in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , will be submitted against five people .
members of the New York Baruch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ P@@ si @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood joined Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during a launch site in September 2013 , and delayed its transport to hospital , which contributed to his death , the police .
officials said that he had been loaded with inter@@ connected eyes with a 30 pound back@@ pack of sand , and was attacked again while trying to stri@@ ve over a frozen field at a target .
Mr. Den@@ g mour@@ ned over a head@@ ache , then he dropped his way .
the members of the P@@ i Delta @-@ P@@ si bes@@ bro@@ therhood do not call the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was born and waited for an hour before they brought him into a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ &apos;s clothing , his symptoms in goo@@ gle and Andy Men@@ g , to contact the National President of the Brotherhood to join the Council , police sign Chris Wagner on a press conference .
&quot; at this point , the members of the u@@ en@@ sil@@ ia began to hide and the welfare of the bro@@ therhood was basically asked by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; St@@ alli@@ ef Wagner .
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died on the next morning to his injuries .
after a aut@@ op@@ sy report Den@@ g was repeatedly added to the head , tor@@ so and upper th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; many families were destroyed by the Muslim Brotherhood . at least one student dies every year in the ik@@ ana , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation .
bro@@ th@@ erh@@ oods and their members need to be comp@@ acted , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Monroe received an indictment because of murder of the third order for the first five members .
two and thirty members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of anti @-@ religious attacks and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; we do not only want to make the involved persons responsible , but when there is an organization that - officially or un@@ official - this , we will also draw those on account , &quot; said Wagner on a press conference on Tuesday .
at the mouth , the Brotherhood College banned the Brotherhood , and the National Brotherhood rejected their affili@@ ation on the outskirts of the town .
this will happen if F@@ ed raises the interest
an interest @-@ rate hike comes , and the Haus@@ se will retreat , R@@ end@@ ums for bonds are rising , and the economy will lead in a recession .
we know that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we do not know how long will it take and how long it will stop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , the story for the economy does only offer small guide to the exp@@ ir@@ ation process .
a recession arrived within just 11 months following the first interest rate and lasted 86 months .
the aggressi@@ vity of the Federal Reserve at the lifting of interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in the economy and financial investments are re@@ acting .
therefore , the representative of the US Central Bank has under@@ scores that investors should not focus on it whenever it begins to increase interest rates , but rather over the period which is needed for normal@@ ization .
indeed , several variables are playing a role .
at the end , market participants may however state that the entire exc@@ itement was possibly ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated because of an interest rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is reas@@ on@@ ably interpreted by some of a signal for the end of the era of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; budget &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian J@@ ess@@ op , Chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we are not expecting the gradu@@ al return of U.S. interest on normal heights , but still at low level , to the seism@@ ic shock , to lead many .
however , this doesn &apos;t mean that there will be no effect .
here is a historical trends , based on how some areas of the economy might react :
as the market has seen last month , it can take a few rate hike for a while .
once the increase arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tendency to di@@ ver@@ ed branches from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which might possibly refle@@ cting the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Deutsche @-@ Bank @-@ anal@@ ysts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said in a recent study , what happened to interest rate for F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more precisely , the market is generally down@@ ward in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way towards interest rate , fairly flat in the 250 days after an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.4 % according to a recent analysis , which Bob D@@ oll , chief facility @-@ strateg@@ ist at Bar@@ ron &apos;s Asset Management .
the Deutsche Bank said that the effects of the shares ten@@ ds to include a cycle in the increase cycle , and so the rate of return begins to decrease .
recipes are a fact of business living , but interest rate spots they often promote it .
in the current case the F@@ ed is con@@ fron@@ ted with some conditions that could not give it before and accelerate the recession .
very remarkable is that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point in an interest rate by F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , 118 percent interest rate hits the nominal GDP of below 4.5 percent since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 stood at 3.6 percent , only a few that this will continue over and forecast for the third quarter according to Atlanta F@@ ed , only 1.5 percent .
interest rate at a so frag@@ ile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and t@@ oss the question as if it is otherwise , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank .
market participants have made this year on an interest rate of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were fixed to meeting the Federal Open Market Committee in this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this meeting , there are only a 25 percent probability of Fut@@ ures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all power cycles from 1950 to today had taken place in a super cycle with increasing threshold of GDP and very quickly after the start of recovery in the shade , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by contrast , this is clearly slow recreation of what the worst recession in the observed phase was .
the current cycle is far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of last recession , the record was 35 months , and so far only 74 months .
the fixed income was also vol@@ at@@ l , since the market represents a rate @-@ rate hike , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds qu@@ icker than in shares , when changing their strategic course .
in bonds , the R@@ end@@ ites would seem to change the initial increase in the cycle , as soon as the first increase in the cycle .
at the end of the enh@@ ancing cycle , the investors fall at once , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strateg@@ ist of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to make sure that yields from long and shorter bonds can lead to a flow in the curve .
highly inn@@ it@@ ated bonds often bring higher yields in such climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Analy@@ st in Schw@@ ab , in an analysis .
interesting is , Jones , that the markets have already adjusted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; next to the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation , there are some evidence that the market has adapted to the outlook on str@@ ingent monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
short term interest has risen , the yield curve is increased , lending is expanded , and the volume of vol@@ at@@ ility has risen - all the characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed continues its strategy .
in the large and whole are enterprises to wrap up the larger part of their business activities in the U.S. , including interest rates and local products will become more attractive .
multin@@ ational corpor@@ ations with high debts are worse , as a growing dollar makes its products on the global market more expensive and also financing their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares ten@@ ds to react very positive for three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ man Sachs @-@ anal@@ ysts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were published in a report to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have surpassed company with a weak balance following each of the interest rate in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points .
company with high capital R@@ end@@ ents as well as low volume throughput at their shares also exceeded their poll@@ en with low quality by on average 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts are a big problem .
companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose most , Gold@@ man said .
purely of pure equity games , consumers are also benef@@ iting from the increasing Dollar .
savings might see gains through higher earnings , even if experts of different opinion are , as soon as they will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says parliament of parliament Andrew B@@ ingham
a conservative member of Parliament critic@@ ized the radio because of his &quot; sil@@ sen@@ ic &quot;
he argu@@ ed that he is not difference to any commercial rival .
he also applied to the BBC Music Awards and said that they only cited The Br@@ its
Parliament @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien Collins : the sending The Voice to and said that this was not very original .
BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns into Classic FM , asser@@ ts a leading member of parliament and increases new pressure on the transmitter to prove that it does not do something to the private television .
the conservative MEP Andrew B@@ ingham also said to the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen , the public @-@ legal radio station , &quot; and increasingly no longer be different from its commercial compet@@ itor .
&quot; radio 3 seems - I &apos;m using the word &quot; stup@@ id , &quot; but it seems to be converted to Classic FM , &quot; he said .
he also played at the BBC Music Awards , which started in the last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which began last year , seem to be the Br@@ its only under another name .
so if you try to do something different - these are two spontan@@ e@@ ously mentioned examples in which you only have the im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC @-@ general director pointed out the stran@@ ds and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 goes far from its commercial printers , when it comes to public live music and clari@@ fication .
what I learn from Radio 3 I will learn about classical music somewhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music , that &apos;s really un@@ surpassed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and to give the commitment of Radio 3 , new music and to give new works in order , I think also really important &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said he . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argu@@ ed that har@@ der should be used to eng@@ age the audience , when it did this in the past , because the British had been informed about classical music .
radio 3 was however not the only one element in BBC production that , during the preliminary hearing in the Committee for the selection of culture , media and sport , under the fire , to tr@@ ash the commercial rival to the feet .
the Dam@@ ien Collins @-@ MEP The Voice Command - the musical talent for the BBC , which was bought by the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not especially mark@@ edly ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was created in a special BBC @-@ mode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wishes the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our house in the stable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it &apos;s the next time a entert@@ aining series . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclu@@ de the order of further bat@@ ches of The Voice in the Future or to issue money of the applicant for other entertainment formats .
sales revenues in August at the slow@@ est down and the Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sale .
last month , there was the lowest result since the start of the record in 2000 .
online sales increased 3 years ago by using mobile phones to buy
experts believe that the Black Friday in November has slow@@ ed down .
for over a decade the virtual shopping cou@@ pe , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into spirit .
but experts say that there are evidence that online sales have stag@@ n@@ ating , after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the start of records in 2000 with just five percent increase from the previous year .
experts predi@@ ct that online sales are stag@@ n@@ ating , after new figures showed just seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you consider the growth rates for the previous years , and by 2000 , during the course of time , Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , the publisher of the IM@@ RG sales complex , said the gu@@ ardian angel .
he explained that online sales were increased by more than 3 years ago when buyers began to sell shopping with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and could people do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now this is a way , and we &apos;re going to see that growth is reduced .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon , which was imported from America , is cited as a reason for the re @-@ aband@@ on@@ ment turnover .
experts believe that buyers will hold their purchases outside this event , which will take place last Friday in November .
last year , the average number of buyers got to make their computer to make their bar@@ gain , and some dealer websites collap@@ sed .
experts believe that Black Friday , in whom the buyer could kill for bar@@ gain , buyers will be able to keep purchases .
a study by the British Ret@@ ail Con@@ sortium found that £ 5 in total spending is spent £ 1 £ online .
with some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one @-@ third of the purchases now be carried out through Web @-@ shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people bought clothing and shoes online rather than rather than the fashion shoes in the old town .

function of A@@ I / D@@ ob because of im@@ pur@@ ities before the court ,
Klagenfurt , the Provin@@ cial Court of Klagenfurt , on Wednesday two officials of the Austrian volleyball @-@ runner . A@@ I / D@@ ob must be able to answer to un@@ faith@@ fully and eradi@@ cation .
the accused were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse of abuse .
he has been acquitted of all charges in May 2009 .
the current process was post@@ pon@@ ed .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , it emerged in the preliminary survey that the accused were used in the years 2006 to 2011 , when they were em@@ itted into their functions for private purposes .
it reaches the damage of approximately 400,000 euros .
the sports func@@ tion@@ aries are also accused because of financial crisis .
this fact was the chairman of the closing act , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it is said to be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
regarding the murder of the un@@ faith@@ fulness , the defence asked that the association was made at no time a wealth of property .
the sports functional would have been paying upward and the sport club for whom they worked from 1982 till 2011 , in which they had contributed much time and money to have risen from the debts - the liabilities were approximately 600,000 Sch@@ ill@@ ings ( about 44@@ .000 Euros ) in 2001 .
&quot; then , we stood before the situation : &quot; when we continue with the club , we supposed to continue the club ? , &quot; one of the accused , on the bread calls for the financial li@@ fel@@ ess of the financial market .
with his colleagues and co @-@ accused , he decided to take this task .
with all risks .
&quot; we have put money in the Bank to put our life insurance companies as security at the Bank , &quot; he said during the arrest .
with the association it was agreed : you can manage the money free , it may only be done no debts .
furthermore - with the applicable financial , the dis@@ bur@@ sement of money @-@ damage caused by the end of 1991 has been decided .
as a result , a portion of the damage deposit was not paid only years later , namely , from 2003 when an increase happened to the account .
therefore , tim@@ pan@@ - and no detail@@ led bookings can be explained below , the ex @-@ speaking observ@@ ations .
the accounts and savings related to the two accused in common , said the second accused .
why the pay@@ outs have not been opened in detail , asked the judge .
the association is not interested in detail in detail for the financial intermedi@@ ary , important is only the debt of debt , so the answer .
when it began , in 2011 , an amount of € 120,000 was transferred to the annual report .
these were the accused , the accused .
this securities entitled to the name of the second accused and was not known according to the association .
&quot; why ? &quot; I wanted to know the judge .
and there@@ for , the Be@@ au asked no answer .
then he thought that he was believed that this was the best thing for the club .
if something happened to him , no one would have known any of this money , the prosecutor turned in the room .
the co @-@ accused was informed , the func@@ tion@@ ment of the func@@ tion@@ ment of the func@@ tionally .
this transfer was formulated as a &quot; compensation &quot; for compensation .

in its restructuring of the US technology group , the U.S. technology group plans to minim@@ ize 25,000 to 30,000 positions in its corporate customers .
this means that the company will be saved € 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) , divided the company on Tuesday .
the stage will lead to a special charge of approximately € 2.7 billion , which will be incur@@ red in the fourth quarter .

time of decision on interest rates for the US banknote
the world is observed when the US @-@ banknote is coming on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to meet the important decision , whether the first time has been raised , or not for the first time since almost a decade .
a survey of 80 econom@@ ists who were surveyed by Reuters that a little more than half , the last week of view was that the F@@ ed will do this , now considering that the F@@ ed will continue to wait some longer and the interest rates on this present stand of 0 @-@ 0.25 percent will hold .
it is a historic event because it has seven years ago since the F@@ ed has earned interest on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time we approach a situation in which a large central bank possibly leaves the null @-@ area and starts a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , Head of employees at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the US economy is on a relatively good performance level , trillion dollars will be added to the balance and generate just a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore a positive outlook on global conditions .
it warned us in the markets to adapt to an increase , but the evidence indicate that the odds for such a step are good .
the decision should be announced at 20.00 hrs CET on Thursday
death cap on Delta State University left debt compensation
after shooting and killing of his gir@@ l@@ friend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he started his colleague and killed - wrote Sh@@ annon on a note to tell him that &quot; he could do no pity &quot; in the first murder and , &quot; he could un@@ done it , &quot; said public authorities on Tuesday .
the Police in G@@ auti@@ er , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , teacher for Ge@@ ography and social scientific education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had shot to someone and killed someone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb has said the staff of the emer@@ gen@@ cies that the police must send polic@@ emen to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enjoyed my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he mentioned also that a sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house , but he that &quot; no one will be &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably he will be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police demanded the call@@ ers after his name , but he did not ask him .
Lamb didn &apos;t have any explanation for his shots .
as a police informed the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ ent@@ ner , 41 , and a handwritten note from Lamb , 45 , and a handwritten note : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I , too , I could reverse it .
I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman who loved me . &quot;
after the letter of the note , I drove 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he eventually took his own lives on Monday night when polic@@ emen trained to am@@ assed him .
University President William La@@ for@@ ge said he knows nothing of the conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs idea . &quot;
in spite of reports on Monday , the Lamb believed that he also had a relationship with Schmidt , said authorities on Tuesday , there is no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ ec@@ ks@@ um . &quot;
at Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said that she had married about seven years as a &quot; good man &quot; was described .
the two were di@@ vor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ ent@@ iss had a daughter , who is 19 , and it was &quot; destroyed &quot; in the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ un@@ ning had her daughter , &quot; absolutely perfect friends . &quot;
Pr@@ ent@@ ner worked online from home , according to the statement by Lin@@ s@@ day Know@@ les , which was identified as a close friend of Pr@@ ent@@ ner by Sun Her@@ ald .
Know@@ les told that Pr@@ un@@ ning that had a dog called Light@@ ning , had met for approximately three years with Lamb .
&quot; she wanted to help others , &quot; said Know@@ les
the police said that I called upon a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; he don &apos;t go to prison . &quot;
as a polic@@ emen visited him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville , I drove his car to the side , fled to the forest , ran in the woods and killed himself with a shot .
Lamb received a doctorate in early 2015 from the Delta State University , awarded a doctorate in how his life is based on the University &apos;s website .

the Lufthansa continues its business structure and evalu@@ ates the cheap Eu@@ row@@ ings .
the real@@ ignment is a contribution to an annual profit contribution of around € 500 million per year from cost @-@ proceeds and proceeds to the airline on Wednesday .
among other things , there is no more Management Board more for the passenger business in the future .
the low @-@ fare Eu@@ rov@@ ings should be as independent as possible .
in the Executive Board , chief Carsten Sp@@ oh@@ r will be responsible for the future Karl Ulrich pra@@ ises for Eu@@ rov@@ ings in future .
with the new position , Fre@@ k@@ oh@@ r re@@ affir@@ ms the significance of Eu@@ rov@@ ings , which the Group wants to compete in the future against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet .
so far , the organisation of the 120 000 employees was complex .
the airline operates under the roof of the Passage Air@@ line group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion Euros .
new negotiations with the pilots
the negotiations with the pilot association cockpit ( VC ) should start negotiations with the pending strike on this Thursday .

Luke Sha@@ w by Manchester United can &apos;t play mon@@ opol@@ y because of double the correction
Luke Sha@@ w failed with the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Eindhoven the gain of his right leg .
while this makes the left outer def@@ enders to organize and close it for at least six months of playing , Louis van G@@ aal saw the hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season .
the injury was caused by a cat@@ astroph@@ ic attack by H@@ é@@ blu@@ Mor@@ eno in the 15 minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w was integrated into the PS@@ V sector .
he was treated in the field for nine minutes and required oxygen before being brought to hospital .
van G@@ aal said : &quot; he has twice the structure and is in the hospital . &quot;
he will be moved tomorrow or maybe one day later and then in Manchester .
it is aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it is very difficult and then doesn &apos;t play it , and then it happens .
in the dressing unit he had a oxygen mask .
he wept .
I am no doctor , but if you have a double correction , then it takes six months , and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope that he can play this season back again .
Mor@@ eno seemed to be happy with a red card and the suspension of a cub@@ icles .
Nic@@ ola R@@ izz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , didn &apos;t pun@@ ish the Mexican .
van G@@ aal assumed that the Italian refer@@ ee had v@@ aul@@ ted .
you can judge for yourself if I say , that a El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
a twe@@ et to Sha@@ ws account was : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can &apos;t describe how broken I &apos;m , my way to recovery begins now , I come back stronger again . &quot;
In@@ to : Manchester United has suffered the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in the defeat at the PS@@ V
with the European Championship in France , the US def@@ enders have added an additional inc@@ en@@ tive to recover from this until the coming of June .
Philli@@ p Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very serious injury . &quot;
when a player leaves the room with this kind of injury , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our player to viol@@ ate a opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a break , as Mexico had played against Van Ga@@ as Holland team at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to viol@@ ate the opponent , and if you hear that it is a very bad injury , isn &apos;t that good &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Coc@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball , who was traveling there in another direction , so it looked like he &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult to be something .
I feel very bad . I &apos;m so tired .
the PS@@ V @-@ player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to hospital - after a tre@@ oul@@ le from Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David knows David Cameron &apos;s Lor@@ ax better ?
it is a thing that loves all parents quickly : if your child loves a book it will not take long until you know almost completely .
unless so , you might be David Cameron .
when he was asked by a supplier of child care systems to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , which emerged in 1971 , decided to become Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of Super@@ camps , and goes on : &quot; funny , moving , creative , and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , because it seems always a painting or a message that we have so far missed . &quot;
everything nice and good , besides the fact that reference book , where Cameron describes the hand@@ some of the book , instead , a summar@@ izing the film version of 2012 , which added new characters and details to extend the pretty short original text .
&quot; in the middle of the city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville where all nature is gone and even the air is a commod@@ ity , hopes the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the heart of his dreams come , &quot; reads , &quot; a love inter@@ act was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was Theodor Se@@ uss Geis@@ el , who died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if that is not suspic@@ ious enough : the text of the Lor@@ ax movie , which will be presented on the web site of Internet Movie Database , is where everything is artificial and even the air is a commod@@ ity , hopes it &apos;s a boy named T@@ ed , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
even though he got to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems un@@ likely that Cameron sounds a hand@@ ful@@ ler boy , like the local environment through cov@@ et@@ ous , trees , vulner@@ able , sp@@ oo@@ king beings , &quot; that speaks in the name of the trees , &quot; devast@@ ated .
most likely , such a relatively low PR &apos;s task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per that the Lor@@ ax did not read 20 times in a row with a child .
a Dow@@ ning Street spokes@@ person said that the text was probably come from Cam@@ er@@ ons &apos;s voting office .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text of Cam@@ er@@ one employees was delivered but no more immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s crew , but it &apos;s still difficult
at Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , there is a difficult task , but if you chose the K@@ ader , the England for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series is not on my card .
I would not exclu@@ de a back@@ ward victory .
Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks page is probably less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the batt@@ ing list , and the joint is powerful ; they will wear no sc@@ ars of 2012 , but only a young finally positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali develops as Spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and A@@ DI@@ L Ras@@ hid , even if it represents an unknown size on test level , is an option for the attack .
good news : Adam Ly@@ th leaves from the UK @-@ Test @-@ K@@ ader from the England @-@ Test @-@ Station and is replaced by Alex Hal@@ es .
let &apos;s allow the decision to analyse Adam Ly@@ th , of course , for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , difficult to analyse .
with its seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that Cri@@ ck@@ et@@ players are al@@ igned for results .
there was no question mark in Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to nom@@ ination , as - and I told these - players have their own best albums .
long ago she had extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own dest@@ iny .
when looking for new purchases in Yor@@ k@@ shire , there is a further chance .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss gave his position , even though he did not make good performance , and it was surprised to me ; he is especially a team man .
the question of how much time is a test strike to be going to be his sign is difficult .
Ly@@ th received seven opportunities - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ son got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to home and return .
the only way that one can hold is that England arrived first Jonathan Des@@ p@@ ite in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th in peak shape - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex Hal@@ es comes in , and he is a business@@ man , whom I stand high .
he &apos;s an X @-@ factor cri@@ ck@@ et@@ player , which we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he achieved 236 with a tr@@ ent bridge , which met us tremend@@ ously .
he must have at least the same chances of winning players in front of him , but this depends on the student positions in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to cook Mo@@ een next to Cook , get an extra spin feature and get four j@@ acks , di@@ pped , and I have nothing about it .
I do not see why a b@@ ats@@ man can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed has already shown that he is an Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ er@@ l of Cri@@ cket players .
Mo@@ een hasn &apos;t done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but is there a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference .
my previous team @-@ mate Just@@ in Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests in the first drop before he joined the Op@@ ens in 2001 .
he made us three hundred times , and looked not back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari arrives in the K@@ ader as a Back @-@ up @-@ Sp@@ inner , and in my limited handling he has greatly impressed me as a young man .
people may see his statistics on - on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it is a P@@ unt , but there is no big number of backup re@@ ins that raise their hands and the trainer op@@ ted for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made some wise supplements as the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ thing , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a Master coup .
he is one of the n@@ ett@@ est seeds of the game that will bring an abundance of experiences since he played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and powerful use into the setup .
I always felt that he is created for the International Cri@@ cket Competition as a player or as a coach , and how Mah@@ ela has one insight , from which we can benefit .
sometimes , new voices can be fresh in the changing cabin fresh breeze , even if the messages in accordance with the previously said .
coll@@ y Team@@ Set at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , will not be used by the One Day@@ ers , R@@ oot received a similar interval to Australia and I have no problem with them .
some will not agree , but Co@@ aches and team@@ rider can not determine the schedule .
and they must remember that , as with the players , they depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy with heart .
the Bre@@ x@@ it camps ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit Britain &apos;s from the EU ) could impos@@ e recru@@ it if the economy had sl@@ ack@@ ened until 2017 .
David Cam@@ er@@ ons un@@ paid new negoti@@ ation strategy to hold Britain in the EU , is recommended by every day , even without the choosing of gen@@ ius Jeremy . &quot; is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n for the leaders of Labour or the TU@@ C , which was heavy on Tu@@ esdays through Europe .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ acy acts as well that some member states , so deep smo@@ ked into different cr@@ ises such as the EU is now and not always from its own debt , Britain &apos;s proposed agenda with pointed cor@@ ri@@ dors and inter@@ fer@@ rous changes , which they often do not want to be satisfied .
in Brigh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting in Brigh@@ ton , it may not like to end@@ anger the social protection .
we might also call it with Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climbed to summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capital cities , make a photo of themselves before a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they win allies for re@@ forms .
it always goes around me .
my European friend , who wish to look inside the outside of the UK outside of the EU , &quot; Let us not leave us alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and can have learned that more and more short @-@ sigh@@ ted ministers and civil servants come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we remain or go .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is an allies but she has been active for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as it could be done with ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ation as Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
French François Hollande looks back on his re @-@ election , and its replacement in 2017 .
he is also an immer@@ sive strength .
Poland may soon have a national@@ istic right government , Spain left one left .
it is difficult to imagine that they will tear a leg , in order to avoid the Sel@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy is better to avoid from the UK - something that they don &apos;t want to do as most of the separ@@ at@@ ist tenden@@ cies .
therefore , some such ministers may not make helpful explan@@ atory notes , quite in the SN@@ P @-@ style , while Britain &apos;s refer@@ end@@ point in 2017 to speed the Bre@@ x@@ ite process , guess my friend .
&quot; the new trial was a Ple@@ ite &quot; and &quot; Great Britain has won no value from the re @-@ negoti@@ ation . &quot;
Europeans know how to be burning the Fle@@ et Street to its costs and what EU sk@@ ep@@ ti@@ cian is the Oli@@ gar@@ chy of the Press @-@ bar@@ one , but they did not have been involved with a ratio of 2 : 1 during the Tony Ben@@ n @-@ inspired refer@@ end@@ ums .
you can recall weak at Boris Johnson , the ore of the brass euro Opp@@ ortun@@ ity , who made himself a name as an &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade Ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 @-@ s .
at all his re@@ im@@ bur@@ se , Ed Mil@@ i@@ band knew who his enemies were .
for this , the Med@@ ley belonged to tax ev@@ ing @-@ slo@@ ping people , teleph@@ ony h@@ ack@@ ing countries , and the pseud@@ o non @-@ in@@ ventions who possess the majority of our big newspapers .
actually Tony Bl@@ air thought on them , but exhibited when you &apos;re sitting with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , one is better ban@@ anas in order to di@@ stract him instead of his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mil@@ i@@ band more Bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ aner blo@@ ated as Bl@@ air himself , because Bl@@ air had turned the principle above all the EU &apos;s constitution , which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which in order to open a back@@ door .
the press never stopped its way .
but the nice Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly fl@@ aps on the back at the Monday in Westminster - I told him that he would not need to repeat the time more for me in danger , Neil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cott Mur@@ der strategy of the 80 @-@ year @-@ old , a mistake at that time and today .
it may take up , but he must develop a coh@@ er@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa has left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position is to Europe - I do it friendly - in development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside the ti@@ pping of traditional bl@@ az@@ ar@@ b@@ ye tendency and the wild poultry of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can everyone say Yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary has been a Ben@@ n , but no Ben@@ n@@ ite , &quot; Ben@@ n in Radio and TV this week said , when the boy sc@@ outs fought in him , not ad@@ mit that Cor@@ by@@ ns is the appointment of the prov@@ oked John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as a shadow Chancellor .
it remin@@ ded me of the 70 &apos;s years , when his old father concerned himself in television , to his labour @-@ cabin , without going far too far and lose his cabin job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys was even more attractive .
but to fight for &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Ben@@ ns expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his fellow @-@ conflict and de@@ pu@@ ties in all reports on Monday night .
whatever the same touches of Bott@@ om @-@ Up image from Cor@@ by@@ n wants to mind - remember that he even stir@@ red me - News Dis@@ cipl@@ ine remains important in the era of TV around the clock and above all things in the Stru@@ del of Social Media , a brood @-@ place of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ y@@ al .
it is right to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe that allows him to hold ma@@ ke@@ yp@@ ad support in the refer@@ end@@ setting campaign , such as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell it said .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins think so .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns basic movements to the EU membership - in line with their ben@@ ch@@ ite popularity under the left @-@ capitalist past - is no longer a question of es@@ ot@@ ting discussion under left dis@@ sidents , for which the Nar@@ c@@ is@@ sm@@ us of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disp@@ utes .
as with its am@@ big@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C does not launch a campaign for Australia - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find in all a sense of their su@@ peri@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin search for political capital - they also have mis@@ m elec@@ tors - to make conc@@ essions to the British , if it can be po@@ int@@ less ?
the USA already are fairly dis@@ appo@@ inting from weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government on power , which I was remin@@ is@@ cent of the launch of the British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .

he published the &quot; Basic Evaluation Report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
however some researchers have asked the loading capacity of the data and directed to the connections between several experts and tobacco industry .
an editorial supporting article in the Lanc@@ et last month ended the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily wide basis , &quot; which he founded his most important conclusion .
two further researchers are in BM@@ J and asked whether to build the asser@@ tions &quot; on stone or sand . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Ep@@ idemi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies are based on the detection of effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public expect the asser@@ tion that &quot; the current best estimate is that E @-@ cigarettes is about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for a multi Crit@@ eria decision analysis ( MC DA ) to lead their views on the damage of various nic@@ ot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ised in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a company called by the meeting a company called &quot; Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously received from British American Tob@@ acco ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BA@@ T in public health in a sustainability report , said they .
one of the 12 participants agreed on the meeting to obtain funds from a E @-@ cigarettes manufacturer , but not the financing which he report@@ edly received in reports before the tobacco firm Philip Morris International , added them .
the reasons for selecting the members of the committee are not supplied but including several well @-@ known e @-@ cigarettes champ@@ ions , some of which also indicate a industry financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the tobacco saw from P@@ he took part in the meeting .
the research work on the group &quot; says inde@@ struc@@ tible that there is a lack of hard evidence for the damage of most products in most criteria , &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well revealed .
however , no such connections or restrictions related to the P@@ he Report will be discussed .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; There is no evidence that &quot; there were no evidence whatsoever that you have not served as a way for smoking for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers . &quot;
pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and Wellness at P@@ he said that BM@@ J has responded to the statement of information forwarded by the BM@@ J .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long cat@@ cher dies in his ad@@ dic@@ tives .
all evidence suggests that health risks of e @-@ cigarettes in comparison was low , but we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has unique obligation to the information of the public about what the proof of evidence and what is not , especially when there is so much public confusion over relative haz@@ ards in comparison to tobacco .
nearly 80,000 people die annually at a disease with respect to smoking , and smoking costs the National healthcare system £ 2 billion per year .
through the clear demonstration of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fra@@ ction of damage caused by smoking by smoking , we comply with our national supervision .
BBC should aband@@ on the BBC mas@@ quer@@ ade , former CEO of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop programs like East@@ l@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial Ri@@ vals &quot; would give her right arm &quot; for Hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the radio stations should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not broadcast through other UK broad@@ caster .
in fact , he critic@@ ized the BBC for providing public @-@ legal programmes that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard @-@ disp@@ uted time windows of the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals , and traces of transmitters such as BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC general director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he said about to join Channel 4 in his time at Channel 4 without success .
&quot; I have problems with the idea that there are BBC programs in order or sends it clearly from un@@ conventional ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus @-@ communications committee in the context of his investigation on the future of the BBC .
if you would like to keep the broadcast fee , what I do to do or do not want to obtain a good idea , you should at least make the production at least on programs that do not make any other or in order .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class window , because they want to reach as a broad support for their future .
the idea that otherwise nobody would show this is a joke , it is ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , of course there is non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not see why a reg@@ ression tax programs is financed without subsidi@@ aires . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another program ad@@ mitt@@ edly both in @-@ production .
hon@@ est@@ ly , other channels would give their right arm .
I would like to see me how this is a public broad@@ ly TV .
I don &apos;t believe that this would decrease the BBC .
Johnson , a entrepren@@ eur for series , channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC school on the hunt is &quot; because of the amb@@ itions of people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular ship@@ ments of the BBC will present that was the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 , that the BBC shows had to sell like the East@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on BB@@ C4 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said they should not measure the audience , but they fulfill their duties , and they can ar@@ gue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these programs , no one has seen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they place them in a time window , in which nobody wanted to see them .
at the radio fee , Johnson said to the Committee : &quot; I request you to find a rather reg@@ ression system in terms of conditions that can get the best value of this .
of course , you think all we think that one receives a great value for £ 150 a year , but for people who is for the 150 £ a lot of money , ask me if this is true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
the former Sky@@ wire and Channel 5 chief David El@@ ster , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , asked that the BBC would check their Rei@@ th@@ ian Mission to make it information and entert@@ ained . &quot;
he said , only little of the BBC @-@ production would now be classified as education - he said that it would be 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % in radio and it should change in the publicly @-@ supported TV broad@@ casts in Australia and Canada , for example , to elabor@@ ate and maintain . &quot;
to the question of partner@@ ships El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like the Pro@@ ms , of whom he said that only a hand@@ ful in television are shown and with the commercial broadcast alli@@ ances will go on to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ ogen@@ et@@ ics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ emat@@ odes can change the direction at the moment in which they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound im@@ pulses .
scientists have produced dig@@ ms with genetic change of nerve systems that can be controlled from sound waves .
the tiny N@@ emat@@ odes are changing the direction in the moment , where they are listening to high frequencies which are to be heard for the human ear to be heard .
the im@@ pulses are carried out by the power of Mot@@ one@@ z@@ on cells , genetic changes to genet@@ ically modified to react to the membrane channels .
more information about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers told , wor@@ ms , the power of a new procedure , called Son@@ ogen@@ et@@ ics , in which ultr@@ asound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
At@@ ek@@ an@@ th chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian , that the procedure of a day could replace the depths of brain stim@@ ulation , an inv@@ as@@ ive procedure involving human im@@ pulses in the treatment of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease .
s@@ add@@ ressing will not react on ultr@@ asound , but chal@@ as@@ ani realized that they did so if they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic air bub@@ bles .
the bli@@ sters , found out , intensi@@ fy the ultr@@ asound heads which per@@ me@@ ate into the wor@@ ms .
the enhanced ultr@@ asound lenses work on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 receptor channels and can be found in membran@@ es of some of the ages .
the sound waves bring into the opening of these icons and activate the cells that they are allocated to a report Nature Communications .
in order to create ultr@@ asound controlled N@@ emat@@ odes , chal@@ as@@ ani genet@@ ically modified the wor@@ ms to carry some of their Mot@@ one@@ z@@ ons TR@@ P @-@ 4 voc@@ al channels .
when ultr@@ asound mass@@ ac@@ red ultr@@ asound on the changing circles , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ f@@ uses and to switch to wor@@ ms where they switched off the altered Mot@@ one@@ z@@ ons .
the procedure has several simil@@ ar@@ ities with op@@ to@@ genet@@ ics , a ground@@ breaking tool that allows scientists to invol@@ ve neur@@ ons with im@@ pulses of light and light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ ogen@@ et@@ ics might have some advantages compared to this technique .
in contrast to light which must be sent to an optical fiber to the desired spot in the brain , low frequency ultr@@ asound teeth can be prevented without hin@@ dered and can be sent up into the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that , with a therapeutic virus , it is possible that human neur@@ ons are temporary based on ultr@@ asound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said chal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , added .

eight golden rules for life in residence halls
11 years ago I moved as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old in a student residence , still in faith in prof@@ essions and moral re@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the an@@ stressed sm@@ iles of those who I off@@ ended - and to the numerous , leng@@ thy complaints about others .
most of what I &apos;ve learned is dist@@ illed in eight simple rules .
the residence in a residence halls reaches from light @-@ to @-@ fri@@ gh@@ tening up to absolute sc@@ ary .
it is temp@@ ting to wat@@ ering : people tell , from whence you come , if you &apos;ve been losing the Sabbath year , and why you &apos;ve said &quot; hon@@ est@@ ly Mar@@ m@@ ite doesn &apos;t love to love , because in the Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract h@@ ah@@ aha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
bre@@ athe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you to find out human beings that you like to say in contrast to those who don &apos;t want to talk to themselves if your lashes were bl@@ amed in fire and this fire extingu@@ ishers .
let men leave people .
the rooms of people often transform into drinks @-@ recipes , film night venues and public meeting points , but they are also the places where people will attract and under@@ wear their under@@ wear .
to be related to : do not think to start the university with a relationship
Intro@@ duc@@ ing a rough treatment at the university .
their room should be a refuge , but many student halls provide space @-@ to @-@ room @-@ bum@@ ble@@ bee culture that can lead to life and soci@@ ally and can lead to life long friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
nothing in the culture enables you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want to pass through our friendship , but you need to go away because I have consumed the energy that I have consumed for the interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a mild it@@ ones of soci@@ al@@ izing is exhau@@ sted - and send him an SMS instead of t@@ apping .
A@@ pro@@ po@@ s kno@@ b : do it .
a guy in my student halls had the idea that a no closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close through baking .
since you start the university at the peak of back man@@ ner@@ ves , the clo@@ cking to the doors of man , to present themselves with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less strange as the welcome of the 1950 &apos;s years &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I &apos;ve got to give you some personal questions . &quot;
our home @-@ made L@@ eck@@ bus@@ hes are a good way to close ties .
their co @-@ inhabitants feel obliged to enter@@ tain and to enter@@ tain your face with a marv@@ ell@@ ous surprise at the end .
of course it depends on whether you are an independent b@@ aker .
po@@ or@@ ly mixed cl@@ ums@@ y from flour , sugar and fat will lead to them that people are sleeping , if you ank@@ ets .
for food to steal , a lot of space in residence halls is .
of course , the cl@@ aws of h@@ ens is a theft , but is it the take drop Mil@@ k for your tea ?
check it with the dairy factory .
chances are good that they say to operate himself , even if they cook in the inside .
if anyone tells us your things , it is anno@@ ying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with that balanced as my roomm@@ ates that killed their milk an r@@ ins@@ ing agent in order to pun@@ ish th@@ iev@@ es .
she is now in prison .
you should make no noise , the people from sleep or work .
it is not only the only person to be an independent person , but that you belong to the human being as the true sense of the universe .
a girl in my hall asked her neighbours , as it could make them something , drum &amp; bass a bit quiet , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and it had a test in the morning .
she re@@ acted to listen to loud music .
when she stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she left her neighbours still two hours to sleep before she quit her own music , shut down their door and went out to her three @-@ hour trial .
would it not be romantic if your future sp@@ ouse would come to a chance in the same student residence ?
in the reverse , it would not be t@@ ing@@ ed , if you keep a roommate for your future sp@@ ouses to participate in it and will need to see them every day and perhaps to experience how they &apos;re taking out all common friends ?
of course , the heart goes its own way - but if a hot brother is definitely not your future sp@@ ouses , try to try to talk a little bit of mind .
at the exciting moment in which you notice that someone has his key in its un@@ locked room , the limit between a Ul@@ k and Mo@@ b@@ bing circle is lower than it seems .
a good fight is funny , but it takes just moments to get to the b@@ um@@ er@@ ang .
spare parts through plug@@ ging a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but never fail to any one &apos;s room with t@@ ooth@@ paste and sh@@ ampoo .
finish your door , and place your key into a glass of water , which will then place in the freezer - but drives your owners at the ceiling no more than twice .
terra@@ ced houses for refugees , all@@ ot@@ ting , Ger@@ ing@@ se@@ ven@@ er

so for refugees too - but also as a signal : &quot; it is not only refugees living environment , but also just the rich mother and the Ger@@ ing@@ se@@ ven@@ er . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll show how to build and easily build up today , &quot; says the 44 year old in interview
thousands of refugees have penet@@ rated to the property market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner reli@@ es on knowing how rapidly growing living space can be created : it builds in a project home for refugees .
LORD Gil@@ mer@@ cen@@ aries , many refugees d@@ are out of the r@@ ousing market .
what solution can you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ mer@@ cen@@ ary : a mass housing in containers or gym has no sustainability any more .
for humans remain at a great part here .
in view of the refugee &apos;s area , we also need enough space for the next decades .
a brand new , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
Gu@@ ator : a row house needs the least space .
it facilit@@ ates integration .
this is different if you put people in blocks .
each of the six houses , which are just built in the pilot project , consists of three app@@ artments for four asylum seek@@ ers .
each residential unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it can be that many refugees say , it &apos;s peace again , I go back .
then the houses can easily be converted to the respective needs .
how high are the costs ?
Gil@@ das : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house is valued at 184 000 euros , without land .
it is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction lasted six months .
it is reasonable .
did the building regulations allow their plans ?
sorry : these are now working correctly .
particularly complicated , it always makes the da@@ zz@@ ling Dam@@ o@@ cl@@ ut@@ ein special construction and the regulation directive .
gr@@ assy food .
it will still teach you who created three apartments in a row house needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities there is space .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no vehicle .
how did the residents adapt to their terra@@ ced house project ?
plann@@ ers : there were those who have been accused of creating luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers .
what definitely is not correct .
but do not tigh@@ tened the compet@@ ences for paid apartments ?
Gil@@ mer@@ cen@@ aries : in the last five years , we had a building boom in Germany , but the luxury apartments that can hardly be aff@@ ord in the last five years .
my project has the message , even the normal people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the je@@ al@@ ous nut or the Ger@@ ing@@ se@@ ven@@ er .
I &apos;ll show how to get cheap and good today .
this is why it is doing .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by clicking the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , you can download the option to download and then install .
some are subject to the installation of problems because it is an error message telling that the &quot; software update is missing . &quot;
to avoid the problem , users recommend to wait either to wait until the rush goes back or try to update via iTunes .
the phone itself leads you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the del@@ etion of apps to create space - but Apple has made it easier by the dis@@ appearance of the update un@@ likely . likewise it will be easier if you need a special tool to install apps and re@@ install it once the process is complete .
it is worth it to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger , so the battery is loaded .
if the load is too low , Apple can not be rest@@ art@@ ed that the update will continue , as the phone may desc@@ end on half @-@ way and this may lead to a break of the updates .

&quot; we always had in mind that the gar@@ bage would fit good in this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ lows and laugh@@ s .
&quot; when it was time , I simply called them . &quot;
the idea of Müller was pleased to operate the idea of running his own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 39 year old Müller is very attractive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the permanent contact to the patients are very attractive &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Croatia : &quot; we let those refugees through &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the border controls also went on our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister for Interior Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls on the Hungarian border remain parallel in parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as it is clear that everyone who wants to put an asylum request will also be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the supply and safety of people stood at the fore@@ ground .
but it is clear that fact that it needed clear signals , &quot; said the Minister .
people must not know that we do not accept bound@@ less migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Slovenian border .
it takes a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia refuse
the Croatian government had previously reported that Slovenia would continue to leave the refugees in Austria and Germany in the direction of Austria and Germany . in circumstances , there were also cor@@ ri@@ dors for the refugees .
but this was not what the Interior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ head Z@@ ni@@ dar in L@@ ai@@ bach did not look like this .
the idea of Cor@@ ri@@ d@@ itors is &quot; absolutely in@@ acceptable , &quot; in Slovenia , the monitoring of the border - especially to Hungary - intensi@@ fy .
the border with Croatia is already strong electronically as the outside area of the Schengen area .
as the Minister for Foreign Affairs , Slovenia wants to reach its borders for refugees but not abri@@ a .
&quot; every EU member must fill its obligations , otherwise the system cannot work &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed the Gy@@ ör@@ head Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian Government over@@ took , the first refugees had already tried to enter Eastern Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ ID to go out for registration .
the Croatian police could access the near corn@@ fields of corn .
since then , according to local media since then , in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , police cars have been constantly changing to refugees with new refugees .
it was about Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , among them many women and children .
also rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , there were some 4000 refugees in the coming days , the Minister of Interior , Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pre@@ se@@ vo to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian Serb border , which previously brought migran@@ t to the Hungarian border as far as Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
the government in Belgrade is demanding that it is , in order to hit the determin@@ ations of certain Rou@@ tes : &quot; neither can we , nor want to do this , &quot; was named it .
according to media reports , a first bus with around 50 refugees have arrived in the Serbian border town S@@ ID , in the course of the day , further buses were expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants have been on the streets all the night long , around 500 kilometres away from Macedonia .
&quot; we have heard that Hungary has done , so the police have said that we should go there , &quot; said one of the refugees .
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this might seem to be a somewhat closer to the previous Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a little further west .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive options for border control &quot;
in 2012 , Croatia &apos;s Minister of the Interior , O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic , emphas@@ ises that his country had prepared appropriate plans for the event of a strong state of refugees .
details he did not call , but he pointed out that Croatia considered a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; comprehensive option for limit control . &quot;
one lead to strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partner has since gone through a good testimony to the country , in which regard to the standard requirements of the border .
upon Serbian border , around 300 refugees were stuck behind the Hungarian border .
according to the media reports , they passed the past night on the border crossing Hor@@ g@@ os , who leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border crossing Hor@@ g@@ os and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remains completely locked .
if the remaining refugees still want to go on to the Croatian border , it is still un@@ clear .
the Serbian Minister for the foreign minister Neb@@ oj@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic was still calm on Wednesday early in hor@@ g@@ os . he keeps the debates about the alternative of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed for ver@@ t .
it would not be so far to pay a very high refugee .
you could not yet tell whether they would continue their journey beyond Hungary , Croatia or other country .
hel@@ pers on immig@@ rants - dangerous - Alternative Tow@@ ing
however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distribute the refugees maps , which are represented alternative routes through Croatia .
but the border between Serbia and Croatia is not harm@@ less : in parts of the border area , there are still 20 years after the end of the conflict there is still not spacious min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian Police announced that a team of min@@ ers were sent in the border region .

F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ result mixed , financial outlook for 2016 lowered
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appo@@ inting results for the last quarter , and the Lie@@ ber @-@ giant hit his winner &apos;s sight on a whole year because of the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its boat transport service .
the company also said that it plans to hire approx . 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holidays today .
at this time last year F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to set up 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share of the market share was about 2.5 percent in pre @-@ market trade , 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. reported a profit between $ 10,@@ 40 and $ 10,@@ 90 in the business year , which ends in the next May , 20 cents less than in previous predi@@ ctions .
anal@@ ysts expected a survey of Fac@@ t@@ set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the less@@ ness pro@@ spect is increased in spite of the price increases , which will be in average 4.9 percent and effective on 4 January , and despite higher supplements for transporting heavy and large pack@@ ets that will be imposed in November .
the company said that it is still expecting to increase the result compared with the previous year due to cost savings , higher income and growth in online trade .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith states that the company will make solid income , if you do more weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade , consider . &quot;
the plans for the holiday employment have been announced a day later than that of the Ri@@ val@@ et UPS , which plans to hire 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional jobs , equivalent to the same number as last year .
in the quarter that ended on August 31 , F@@ ed@@ Ex served 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share stood at $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just under the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , which were predicted by the twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research / anal@@ ysts .
sales increased by 5 percent to USD 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of the sh@@ acks were expected to be 12.@@ 23 billion $ .
F@@ ed@@ Ex has resulted in a decline in the international priority for shipment in recent years that brought sales in its unit express shipping to stag@@ n@@ ating .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
last quarter sales increased by 29 per cent in the final quarter , but the operating result was basically flat , due to higher costs for larger pack@@ ets and self health insurance .
the Express unit recorded higher revenue from higher prices , while the result was due to higher work costs in the freight business .
in the pre@@ market trade , about an hour before opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares stood at 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0.15 .
the Tuesday closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on their most expected session in the year , Federal Reserve Strat@@ os two days a week , round about a 27 @-@ foot Honduras @-@ Mah@@ ag@@ oni @-@ table to decide whether it is time to take the head for the first time since almost a decade .
above them at an end of the lock , two @-@ storey seating structure is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues must put the economic interests of the nation to all other things .
the Central Bank has a two @-@ fold commission from the Congress : maxim@@ ize US employment and prices stable here .
but since the great recession the F@@ ed leaders have been recognized that there is an unknown third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate might be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predi@@ ct them . it will be announced on Thursday if the US economy is ready to we@@ aned in the short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy show that it is sound growing , the recent tur@@ mo@@ il on the global financial markets that already weak@@ est f@@ ed F@@ ed representatives could rein@@ force this volume of interest by the interest rate for federal states - and it is also just about one quarter percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and the inflation in the first line will be the most important thing that they observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , head economic in the bro@@ ken@@ nel of Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think , if they were looking for a pre@@ text to raise the interest rate , the increased un@@ certainty is to wait around the global market enough to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no con@@ sens@@ us about what the F@@ ed is done what is un@@ sec@@ ures on the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists were recently surveyed by Bloom@@ berg , a rate @-@ rate hike this week was predicted .
however , financial markets are expected to wait a F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance of an increase .
this indicates a decrease of the stock market , if the F@@ ed is increasing the set , it is because the strateg@@ ist lay down the blow by decl@@ ining that a further increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial Average score by 2@@ 28.@@ 89 points or up 1.4 % on 16.@@ 9.@@ 85 .
this action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed Policy holding the sentence in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise when F@@ ed would raise the propositions at that time , &quot; he said .
if they do it , it would have to go very far in their declaration to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t use in pan@@ ic . &quot;
other experts argu@@ ed that a interest rate hike would calm the financial markets because it would act the un@@ certainty when the F@@ ed would act .
still before a month , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the set by 0.25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow dis@@ appearance of mon@@ et@@ ric conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ells had said in the spring and in the early summer , that in this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als that more economic progress would be necessary to increase the proposition .
although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ ed down , the improvement on the labour market is solid this year .
the unemployment rate declined to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for over seven years and near the level , which sees the F@@ ed as full employment .
pay@@ loads have shown acceptance of recovery .
although inflation was constantly under the goal of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representative said that the main reason is the temporary effect of clearly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can handle higher interest rates and takes it because of the tension to the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , Music econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets throughout the world gathered together at the end of the last month , after China had util@@ ized his currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial Average score reached over 16 % in May with the highest level of investors , as investors were afraid that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would have had global growth .
the market has recovered slightly in this month , the Dow &apos;s Du@@ ties has now been around 10 % below the May Day .
for the F@@ ed representative , the market tur@@ bul@@ ence influence the complex lim@@ ulation when increasing the interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of Chinese economy would not have occurred , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ SP , Senior Research Fel@@ low on U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of US @-@ grade . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now he says that they will wait at least one month to get the effects better in the handle .
&quot; there is a lot of un@@ certainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data which describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
the health of the global economy is none of the main areas of the F@@ ed , so it should not be referred to in at their decision @-@ making .
but in the final reason , the F@@ ed Monetary Authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
the blo@@ wers mark of the former Leit@@ ner Ben S. Bern@@ an@@ ke , in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could lead its mon@@ et@@ ized growth &quot; close , &quot; brought tur@@ bul@@ ence around the world .
in a world where markets and econom@@ ies are expected to increase each other , by the F@@ ed representative , they can not only monitor the developments in other places , but also with other central banks and experts advise to obtain a better understanding for the global economy .
their decision @-@ making is &quot; more Arts as Science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , director of the global strategy for the management of the company En@@ vest@@ i@@ Inc .
Jeffrey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond , VA . , noted this month , that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ thre@@ ats on financial market movements that have not been linked to the economic foundation data . &quot;
st@@ acker , unanim@@ ous member of the Federal Open Market Committee , de @-@ called for an interest rate , quoted decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce their mission @-@ ins by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite a limited targeted impact on growth in the U.S. , &quot; said L@@ acker .
a year later the F@@ ed representative cut this cuts .
the F@@ ed should set out aspects of financial stability during a devastating sl@@ ump in 2008 as the market for flame retard@@ ation in 2008 , Adam S. Pos@@ en became a former member of the Committee for the com@@ po@@ unding of the Bank of England .
the youngest tur@@ bul@@ ence does not come close to that level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t want to come into the situation in which she was afraid of interest rate because the markets turned off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pos@@ en , president of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still owns the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until that is changed , I do not think that it should take over time .

Bras@@ il@@ ica pap@@ di@@ at@@ ric society Rio Grande promotes eating for healthy breast@@ feeding
to clari@@ fy the Brazilian organization SP@@ RS , the Brazilian pedi@@ at@@ ric organization SP@@ RS tried to clari@@ fy women about how important nutrition is during the n@@ urs@@ ing time . she does , with the presentation of pictures of babies that are painted on breasts that are painted with represent@@ ations of im@@ healthy foods .
breast milk is composed of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , which require all the nutrients needed to build a strong immune system .
because of the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advis@@ able to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake was not the only dietary change that should be done by mothers .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that healthy eating pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately a healthy diet of the child may impact the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ bowls of the Sports Hall
the Bern@@ ward Municipal Council approved the building license for the 2.3 million Euros expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can become fl@@ atter for solar installation .
the plans for the long @-@ longed sports complex at the Bern@@ ward motor complex is step forward step by step : in recent Municipal Council meeting the revised model entry was blessed without big discussions .
previously , the committee had already decided on the basis of a construction &quot; except for the &quot; respected &quot; Liberation &quot; of the valid project plan .
with the exception &quot; exception &quot; , the permission was made for a special form in regard to the roof structure .
consequently , an &quot; semi @-@ roof with non @-@ styl@@ ed first and roof super@@ structure can be erected . &quot;
background of planning is the planned use of the roof area for solar systems : &quot; thus we get a wonder@@ fully large south @-@ picture , &quot; stated Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the session .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; Liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in turn around the roof of the roof , required for energet@@ ic reasons - was required in the development plan below 10 degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the volume of the hall is significantly reduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan in the front side does not have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions - whereby the Bern@@ ward members normally travels to restri@@ ctive agreements during the liberation of the Liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , at the gym , however , there is no recur@@ ring project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; so St@@ eigen@@ berger .
the gym@@ nas@@ al work at the sports centre is a community project of the community and the SV Bern@@ ried .
about 2.3 million euros are calculated at costs .
supplements are expected from school and lat@@ itude transport .
in the next process , the proposal for the 18 x 36 m ² hall is now presented to the Land@@ rat@@ ec with the exam .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg is supposed to be closed as planned - namely in 2016 .
Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is the new Medical Director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au hospital .
the station and the majority of associates move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au near Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this is the surprise of the mira@@ cul@@ ous plans of the Hospital GmbH , the Land@@ circle Pres@@ ent , confirmed the Land@@ scape in Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
however , a decision on the Supervisory Board , the Supervisory Board conven@@ es next Wednesday , September 23 .
should the plans be implemented , all of the nearly 50 employees would go on the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the overwhelming majority should be with fishermen and the next existing station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
the employees who do not want to join Sch@@ ong@@ au is to be offered a job in W@@ eil@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
the employees are informed about the plans .
this change was triggered by Dr Andreas E@@ der , who has been the Medical Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic since the beginning of the year and now changes to private practice in direct proximity to the hospital .
when the question , who is to compete , came according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , the name of &quot; Fischer , &quot; which was willing to take over the leadership on October 1 , taking over his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
for the home in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this is an &quot; appreci@@ ation &quot; and an extension of the offer in the field of Internal Medicine , &quot; so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
f@@ isher is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) speci@@ alis@@ es in the internal department on gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
over the next two years f@@ ishers want to bring together with his team when the Supervisory Board is entitled to bring together both houses until the next year the old hospital of the sn@@ app@@ y that still has 35 beds , in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years finally is to be closed .
the region has planned this for 2018 for 2018 , if the currently ongoing refurb@@ ishment was completed at the hospital of W@@ eil@@ heim .
J@@ och@@ s @-@ White , who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , joined the report indicating that the house , which is owned by the Federal Council , will in future be used as accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll close it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes to the property , J@@ och@@ s @-@ White couldn &apos;t say there &apos;s a lot of consider@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is currently a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a Tag@@ load sy@@ chiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as one could not happen , such a man will not come back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so fishermen over the Qu@@ asi move to the Le@@ ch , who had been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positi@@ vely and very discre@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the home in which Fischer has been working as a military practition@@ er for more than 30 years .
he has been asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of medical director .

refugees need properties : study war@@ ns of housing pieces
the situation on the German housing market is an@@ amped .
even more refugees seek for a paid lead .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing is in front of a challenge .
the distribution competition in the German housing market has long begun .
with the coming refugees and seek@@ ers from the EU , more people are moving onto a market which is over@@ loaded in many major cities .
they compete with high @-@ income citizens to reach the last paid apartments .
in order to cover the demand for paid apartments , 400,000 new units have to be built up to 2020 .
for this result , a study on behalf of the &quot; social housing &quot; was initiated .
in comparison , there are 26@@ 0,000 units in Germany this year .
this would be 14@@ 0,000 apartments .
refugees have no longer required to live after the first three months of their stay than asylum seek@@ ers living in an initial court .
many to@@ g@@ ents then on the housing market and lined up in the long sn@@ akes in front of the rental apartments .
according to the Federal Office of the Federal Office , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers lived at the last year .
but the negative development of the apartment market is not only rising to the increasing number of refugees .
the study also makes significant fail@@ ures in housing policy of recent years .
Germany Sli@@ ding a housing deficit origin@@ ating from year to year is greater .
currently , Matthias Günther , author of the study , has already been missing in metrop@@ olitan areas .
so many professionals lived in large cities in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults stayed longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot; because of the dol@@ drums on the housing market .
in the major cities , the number of square metres per capita has decreased for the first time during the previous years .
in order to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; social housing &quot; strikes a re@@ boot .
new inc@@ en@@ tives should rest@@ art the social housing of housing .
thus , the government tax could be w@@ ai@@ ved and the tax rate for subsidi@@ zed homes may be suspended until maturity .
Moreover , according to the Alliance , we need an attractive depreciation of am@@ orti@@ zation .
the sponsors for Refu@@ gee and Kf@@ W for refugees have now been good at home in cities and communities .
a good week after the start was on Monday evening with 184 million euros more than half of the available approx . 300 million euros available .
now the project could get raz@@ or too .
refugees have free time : Croatia and Slovenia do corridor
there is almost no more to Hungary after Hungary , since more refugees live in the way over Croatia .
Zagreb Announ@@ ces to pass through Slovenia into the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
dangerous , the route is nevertheless dangerous .
Croatia is pleased to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia about the establishment of a cor@@ ri@@ dors for refugees .
&quot; I have spoken with the Slovenian inner Minister , and if it is necessary we will organise a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian Minister of Interior Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Slovenia is between Croatia and Austria and is already a Schengen area for the Schengen area .
the EU country is still no Schengen country .
after the de@@ position of the Serbian Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees broke into Croatia to reach Western Europe .
500 people have come across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , Croatian TV broad@@ caster RTL .
Hungary had sealed its border for refugees at the previous day .
new laws , which came into force on the same day , could transl@@ ate extra@@ ordin@@ arily de@@ super@@ flu@@ ous asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to pass the refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Mil@@ ano@@ vic explained : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can go through and we are preparing for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and do something .
it is , however , people who didn &apos;t want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police attacked the first refugees on the Serbian border of Croatia in the morning .
most visited media reports from Syria , Iran , and Afghanistan .
they came with the bus as well as taxi and the Serbian border S@@ ID .
immediately after their arrival , they tried to get there on foot on the green border to Croatia .
the refugees shou@@ ldn &apos;t meet refugees on the Croatian border of the Croatian border .
the border strip hi@@ kes out other d@@ angers : there are sharp mines in the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
Min@@ ec@@ lear@@ ner is to create quickly a secure passage .
after the war , no more refugees arrive after the closure of the border .
on Tuesday the police rated the number of 366 times .
shortly before Tor@@ se on Monday , there were still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws stages the over@@ coming and damage of the border as a crime .
therefore 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the southern Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
the convicted ch@@ ur@@ ers thre@@ es up to five years and deportation from the country .
according to the immig@@ ration authority , on Tuesday you have received a total of 94 asylum seek@@ ers on Tuesday , of which nearly all - 93 - on the most important transition in bum@@ ps .
among the applicant , 13 families with small children and two older people .
on Wednesday morning they could have kept 40 refugees .
practically no one has a view to get granted asylum in Hungary .
to Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; safe third country . &quot;
the most likely asylum seek@@ ers are to be settled there .
only a few hundred refugees were gathered in front of the &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ one &quot; at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
and in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke the workers began to go out .
they collected the rub@@ b@@ ish which left tens of thousands of people in the past few weeks .
re@@ gr@@ ating lat@@ tice were dismant@@ led and one of the capture square into the border was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express itself towards the goal of this building .
after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , there are only few refugees .
the country has also strengthened its border control .
around 20,000 migrants took part in the country , but still in the country .
in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the drive to Germany .
the train from there to Germany was stopped to the German authorities in the morning .
in South America , smaller groups of refugees were met regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mayor of the rock &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the border . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the bridge fir@@ sts on Sunday with the bu@@ sier , when suddenly ten people were busy with trav@@ ellers at the entrance of the Zel@@ otes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wer@@ n@@ st@@ einer Mayor Alois Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to go by train to Pass@@ au .
because Germany had sur@@ pris@@ ingly reached the railway traffic in Austria on Sunday , but in Wer@@ n@@ stein &apos;s conclusion , &quot; the city that immediately offered his help and the stran@@ ded along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars on the border to the near Pass@@ au .
prior to that , we have once again shortened our distinctive , with lunch and drinks .
we said we , we &apos;ll get you by car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was for us course , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grat@@ eful .
a man did not take it to hand a large donation - 100 euros for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; it is pleased to have us very pleased , &quot; that Stad@@ ler .
the registered passenger yachts started on Sunday evening in Wels from a ICE in the direction of Pass@@ au in order to rec@@ er@@ ate it after the short notice that the railway traffic was shut to Germany , but still about the border to try .
but the regional train was turned off at the Inn at Wer@@ n@@ stein at Inn .
in Wer@@ n@@ stein , the border @-@ crossing broad@@ casts are generally high in the course .
the bridge festival with the Bavarian neighbours - soci@@ ally soci@@ ably soci@@ ably organized day - is organised by the Union Wer@@ n@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now send thousands of us for another forty thousand , is a logical result of a apparent policy :
instead of help at the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke stock immediately at the erection of structures , our Federal Chancellor delivers highly officially and publicly tra@@ pped by the attitude of Hungarian government in the ha@@ st@@ ine of National Soci@@ alism .
body @-@ bearing these policies are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now faced in the bound@@ aries with cha@@ otic areas .
also , the vol@@ at@@ ters will have to notice that the &quot; yellow Land &quot; which she has invited to offer and welcome nothing , nothing but a further refugee camp .
there will be a major challenge , in view of the lasting refugee currents and the near@@ er of the coming winter , to us the de@@ cent states of safety exploration .
and there will be one more - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad on the search for 35,000 winter refuge
Konrad Adenauer has fully to do all hands with the refugees .
Christian Konrad it used to be his word weight .
the government has used the earlier powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to raise funds for thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first trade center of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen already has received a grip on Konrad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no homeless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he reported about his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the organisation of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday had come to Austria without serious action , &quot; Konrad and praised the organisation &quot; master performance . &quot;
the Interior Minister , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; ris@@ ky situation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in total , Konrad features a demand of 85@@ ,000 quart@@ ets in a hot year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to meet the number , 35,000 accommodations will have to be found in the coming weeks - 20.000 to make the countries available , 15,000 of the covenant .
if there were more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s no barrel without the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already led discussions with the state capit@@ alists .
they had been added to him for creating too much for the coming refugees .
&quot; in Upper Austria he runs well , &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ arin supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christophe Schön@@ born , thus it should be clari@@ fied as the church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; great expectations of the asylum coordinates is also aimed at the ORF Action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ps like us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform , individuals can offer privacy individuals .
in addition , we are hop@@ ing for hotels that are empty in winter .
Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for the &quot; very high &quot; yesterday .
in case of emer@@ gen@@ cies , it cannot be that Qu@@ arti@@ c has to keep a certain amount of the towel system or the height of the under@@ stand@@ ings .
for a temporary time , &quot; emergency standards would have to apply .
in contrast to the Interior Ministry , in contrast , he is becoming a successful initiative to fulfil Konrad with his experience .
I am an older Lord , whom we didn &apos;t speak any more into the face of the un@@ speak@@ able .
exc@@ essive force is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er cause the Republic to no charge as they declared themselves .
the number of employees want to increase their number from three to four .
the own qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ism has not yet been successful yet .
Konrad wanted to enter a container at the st@@ eph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are apparently problems with permission .
Linz requires a better distribution
in front of no opening of municipal sport and other buildings like tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for accommodation of refugees , the city of Linz is planning to offer .
this is not necessary because those affected are not able to handle those measures without these measures , Mayor Klaus Lug@@ er ( SP ) .
for the emergency they are supposed to be checked for further sites to their di@@ ver .
critic under city director at the breakdown of refugees within the federal state .
other districts have also to offer its contribution here .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
in a longer telephone conference with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ stir@@ rer ( VP ) has taken over a further procedure in the refugee report on Monday .
Seeh@@ of@@ er saw me as@@ sures that the German borders are not sealed .
further on the journey of refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany are still possible .
however , there must be the respective limits .
special forces with refugees to Germany do not only provide any more .
however , the safety signs would have been associated with regular journeys to Germany .
from the other EU member states , P@@ stir@@ inger also demanded more intensi@@ fied solidarity in the refugee query .
that too , Austria also leads to its borders , is for ag@@ it@@ inger . &quot; a logical consequence . &quot; it is a logical consequence . &quot;
the next R@@ unt@@ astic is a matter of time
the post @-@ restoration of the &quot; New Ship@@ yard &quot; in the Lin@@ zer industry standard has been officially completed .
in four of the six floors of the office and production buildings , the listed IT Group S &amp; T , the remainder ( 2700 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the IT are the smart heads our raw material - and we must try to work for us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T @-@ boss Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could introduce to invest in start @-@ up companies in the New Ship@@ yard , and later also to show which .
even from the beginning , S &amp; T wants to co@@ operate with the new neigh@@ bors - the same @-@ in @-@ house promises , &quot; the next R@@ unt@@ astic is only a matter of time . &quot;
at 1.7 million euros , S &amp; T invested in the location , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ center , which belongs to each third of the city of Linz , the country Upper Austria and the Federal State ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is part of the Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ center .
there are already 30 per cent of the 2700 square meters of the building in the building already rented for another 40 percent .
L@@ ia @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened second store in the Ark@@ ade

in fact J@@ utta Bre@@ it wanted a dog .
this project was forced to move the 49 @-@ year owner of L@@ ia Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade : finally , she now has to get an increase in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop of business , in which they sell among other bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing of various manufacturers , everything is turning to ladies hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are starting from 75 Euro .
large bags and accessories costs up to 500 euros .
the new shop is in operation since yesterday .
it has been rebuilt several weeks ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have long considered long to be able to open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Bre@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
decisive for the decision was among others , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are in Bologna at home , are the idea of an own location in which only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; we are the only in Greater Region , who sell this stamp , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who himself has Italian roots .
her fashion interest has been taken by her mother in the cra@@ dle by her mother .
I am especially advis@@ able if something developed and I can be able to show new trends at competitive prices .
why some woman at the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in ornam@@ ents , also the medical woman cannot answer with the last safety .
perhaps it is about to run a nice bag every out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ull@@ ary watch@@ maker from K@@ all@@ city
the Pf@@ äl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are called An@@ sel@@ or .
this property connects man@@ holes with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for exc@@ itement .
whether he is expressed in foreign host@@ ility , journalists Rü@@ diger goes up or are giving knowledge g@@ aps in international crisis policy - applicants for the US presidential election stim@@ ulates the campaign for w@@ rest@@ ling .
and cuts well over it .
this will also be registered in the spa town of K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate markets are h@@ itting .
the New York with the Res@@ our@@ fr@@ is@@ ur is a term in the wine region on the wine road .
some of the 1200 inhabitants is man@@ age@@ ous about the 1200 inhabitants is related to him .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palat@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election mode .
the old town of Simone Wen@@ del turned a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about his goal , to become the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think that somehow find the somehow exciting , are not so deeply impressed by the city , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del .
native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has an am@@ using documentary about the location and its famous spro@@ uts , where Tr@@ ump is also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for conf@@ ession , comes to &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt , &quot; ( 2014 ) also for Word - as with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ city .
he was not appointed King of the heart .
contrary to the performance of the family , there may be respect to the family &apos;s performance , but it ten@@ ds to invol@@ ve the opinion that Tr@@ ump &quot; is a bit of a big one , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
random men@@ tioning the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the Vic@@ inity , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher , &quot; says to the flood , &quot; says it .
Tr@@ ump comes from the village of An@@ sel@@ or .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story started in 1885 when the later grandfather was hi@@ ked and opened a local for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
corn@@ erst@@ one of the property company were first real estate in New York .
but life of the grand@@ parents was not free from Tra@@ gic : their desire to return to the hom@@ eland when the Bavarian state belonged to the Palat@@ inate back then .
he was not admitted to Tr@@ ump , because he once was without hom@@ ologation , the Director of the Institute for Elec@@ toral History and Eth@@ no@@ graphy , Roland Paul , had been declared a film start .
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of a &quot; illegal emig@@ ers . &quot;
that means in contrast to the mit@@ ig@@ ated statements of the night .
he had repeatedly spoken about Mexican immig@@ rants in the US and had demanded the construction of a limits imposed by illegal immig@@ rants .
&quot; as is the pol@@ arity , this is not so lik@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a det@@ ectable transformation of Tr@@ um@@ ps ( The O@@ ma was a native Tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a was a born @-@ born Heinz &quot; ) .
the win@@ em@@ akers in retirement looks rather dist@@ anced , &quot; he is always so big . &quot;
believe he that Tr@@ ump is coming ?

USA Today posted a slight increase on the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but his number stayed behind the previous Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Today has closed the gap to sunrise during the last months . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the great re@@ vel@@ iness for seven was the impressive of 800 words with the former series of capture of capture by capture of capture by capture by Erik Thomson .
the new drama on a recently dis@@ com@@ promising father who den@@ ounces themselves with his two children on the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive number of 1.@@ 219 million viewers .
critics were wonder@@ ed if Thomson had a Hit @-@ Show Solo without the ra@@ iser star Rebecca Gib@@ ney could bear .
the result of last night responded with a clear &quot; Yes . &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million viewers and beat the &quot; Block ( 8@@ 38@@ ,000 ) and T@@ BL family ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .
seven had mixed results at evening two of The Chase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 a.m. to 5.@@ 30 p.m. ) of the new quiz Show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ e@@ fe revealed on average 4@@ 46@@ ,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ ump@@ ed to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Ed@@ die Hot Seat ( 6@@ 13,000 ) .
on Monday evening the ch@@ ase took a half hour of The Chase Australia 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour br@@ ushed 7@@ 20,000 .
hot Seat average 6@@ 20,000 .
the drop in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Chase Australia is to be confident that hot @-@ seat will ultimately succeed at 17 : 30 .

the final three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
the secret revealed ? ...
L@@ ana je@@ av@@ our Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki have probably made an im@@ pregn@@ able manifest , who wins the Bachelor .
the woman who finally got Sam Wood in The Bachelor &apos;s degree has been kept in greatest confi@@ denti@@ ality .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not be offered , whether it is the one that has received the last Rose .
but when we with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ us Fel@@ lows on the day before we are coming out of three two , you probably won a hint on it who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps back his lips to the finals on Thursday
all three women have looked forward to ly@@ rical manner about why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of hum@@ our , amb@@ ition , family values and positive attitude to reasons why they would like to be at his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should have the final rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; can their answers become a playing destro@@ yer that won the heart of the Bach@@ el &apos;s heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at all times , Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both fast - apart from himself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a long relationship with each other from the first day .
&quot; from the moment , when I went into the house and ( Sar@@ ah ) and Sam@@ ples energies I noted , I felt that they were quite compatible , and I told that throughout the show , &quot; Je@@ av@@ us Fel@@ lows &quot; said .
&quot; Sarah is at his feet on the earth , making it a lot of fun with her , &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki .
I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believed that she and Sam Wood be very well suited as a couple .
from their point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit of the house last week was clear that Wood &apos; could be the One .
&quot; once I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not only a game - I have stopped working on him , &quot; she said .
and when she was asked to pl@@ uck the wood , it was not that she was sm@@ elled .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls equally - it is a tie between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor will be broadcast@@ ed on ten on Wednesday , 19 : 30 .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his NF@@ L career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the USA - and there were many other teams , who sent to their impressive open day of requests last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula , and it looks like a wise decision .
some Trainer would have banned the rest of the game to the Bank as he lost a com@@ motion , as it was the Aus@@ sie Rug@@ by @-@ Liga @-@ Conver@@ ts from his first P@@ unt return on Tuesday during the 20 @-@ 3 victory in Minnesota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula entrusted his husband and gave her next opportunity to a P@@ unt Return , and also in the current game after an injury of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continues to continue his true face in the changing cabin after the game .
instead , he encouraged them to grin@@ d his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the remainder of the team .
Tom@@ s@@ ula confir@@ ming Hay@@ ne publicly in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Sport@@ re@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was encouraged by speci@@ alt@@ e@@ teams @-@ coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who encouraged him to forget his pat@@ ched catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne is pat@@ ched on a P@@ unt , which was re @-@ produced in the first quarter of Minnesota Vik@@ ings
it was certainly not the start to make out the Hay@@ ne and its massive Australian tissue for his NF@@ L debut .
Hay@@ ne left the game board after the F@@ um@@ ble @-@ curse and talked later to the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he could do no wor@@ sen@@ ing start in his NF@@ L @-@ career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a thing which seems to be well , everyone takes care of the next game , and this is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne dist@@ anced the Schn@@ itzer with its Origin was then in 2007 when a pass in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Queens@@ land .
all in all , there was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

parti@@ ality and leader of government Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned at the beginning of the FW @-@ Autumn Au@@ ction in Great Wall@@ onia , when there is no new teacher for many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to preserve the schools before the collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so no further , we must go to the causes &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the Free @-@ sel@@ ector boss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last asylum seek@@ ers want to slide the Free elec@@ tors as quickly as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , Ai@@ wan@@ ger demanded the administration of officials responsible for asylum procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the FW @-@ chief critic@@ ised that several states are not consistently : &quot; we would have a nationwide common standards of federal states . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria is moving forward , others not . &quot;
&quot; we need to be more toler@@ able . &quot;

4 people killed after police officers have shot in Nepal on protest@@ ers
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal since the police were forced into a human amount , demonstr@@ ating against the proposed new constitution , an official on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday night in the Rup@@ an@@ expand region , 175 miles west from the capital city Kathmandu .
Bish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad Dh@@ ak@@ al , Chief Executive Officer , said that more than 1,000 protest@@ ers had gathered outside a police station , some of whom had stones and st@@ icky bombs .
Mr Dh@@ ak@@ al said he had used the police , and then f@@ lowed into the air before using rubber handles .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the infected rubber mig@@ rate , of which is known that they may kill themselves , but which can be used as a less fatal alternative , obviously a so high death rate produced .
the meditation was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nep@@ als southern levels , where members of the Eth@@ nic Group of Mad@@ reti@@ i will say that new provinces , which are formed within the proposed new Constitution , would reduce their policy influence .
there were protests in Western Nepal by the ethnic group of Th@@ arus that want to become their own state .
a minimum of 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent meditation since the 10th .
August killed when the four major political parties signed a agreement to divide the country in the provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversi@@ al topic in Nepal who has been ruled over the centuries .
working on a new constitution since 2008 is on its way , but the legisl@@ ature accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legisl@@ ature has voted for this week on certain cl@@ auses in the Constitutional Court in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new Constitution may come into effect on Sunday .

which investor is coming , isn &apos;t clear yet .
no contracts were closed accordingly .
the city of Em@@ den had a part of the plot that is located on the Ring@@ straße / corner large road , had already bought some months ago and the building @-@ owned building is removed .

and there are plans for a new agriturismo at the Small Sea near Em@@ den at the table .
the Inter@@ est@@ ingly , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ den company &quot; System building , &quot; presented his plans for the first time on Monday evening in the Urban Development Committee of the Em@@ den Council .
originally , this point had stood on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under pressure from the project critic and the F@@ DP Group , introducing the investors and management of secret recru@@ itment , Ralf Behr@@ is proce@@ eding from the system construction management to the offensive : &quot; we didn &apos;t have to answer any questions , &quot; he said before the members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to allow all rum@@ ours now to come on .
the project , which is about ten to twelve million euro , has been in discussion for months .
strong reactions under marine ho@@ ists who had come into the session , called the pictures and new details to the desired hotel building .
Roberto Schulz , Sea @-@ owner and member of the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ man , Pro H@@ ieve compl@@ ains : &quot; this will be a giant cl@@ ot@@ z that over@@ tops all other prayer . &quot;
in addition , he fears like some other project critic@@ isms that the traffic would rise strongly through the inten@@ tional size of the facility : &quot; there all buses come to do so . &quot; says Schulz
but what exactly on the good one hectare of the former restaurant is happening , however , is still open .
there is no operator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we have to present a con@@ clusive concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Behr@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this is still missing , the construction plans still have variable .

for slightly over@@ ty diabet@@ ics , weight loss surgery can be helpful .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for easily super@@ overweight people with type 2 diabetes m@@ aturing for a new study at least five years .
it &apos;s still too early to say , whether easily overcome people with diabetes , after weight loss surgery longer than those who received non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mortality data needs a long time to show something &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , a expert of weight loss surgery , which wrote an editorial to the new study in j@@ ama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss surgery or o@@ bes@@ ity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the physical ability to take food .
over the years o@@ bes@@ ity operations have proven to treat type 2 diabetes as efficiently , but most studies were conducted among people who are disease @-@ ob@@ ese with a Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ( BMI ) of 35 or above .
BMI , a certain degree of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BMI of 25 or above indicates that someone is overweight , and people with a BMI of over 30 are considered to be ob@@ ese .
you can calculate your BMI here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data that they have been in a study since 2007 and compare two types of o@@ bes@@ ity surgery - Mag@@ num@@ b@@ ypass and gast@@ ric cancer - with medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in humans which were slightly above important .
the average BMI under those who underwent surgery dropped from 31 to 24@@ ,5 % to the end of the fifth year in this study .
the BMI with those who are non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments were approximately equal to 29 .
among those who under@@ go a surgical procedure , the type of diabetes was completely dissolved in 36 % , and partly 28 % .
in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group the diabetes could only be achieved in comparison with diabetes by only one percent , and in some cases only around two percent .
in addition , the results of the experience of blood pressure , tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ de , and the &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol &quot; was generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , and found the authors .
the researchers also supervised the patient @-@ blood mirror of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c which reflects blood sugar levels in the course of time .
hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c is best held under 7 percent , write the researchers .
after the surgery the average hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but this better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; glyc@@ em@@ ic Control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - as you reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level - did not decrease the mortality in five years , so the leading researchers Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also toler@@ ates average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year the b@@ ypass surgery group had been lost more weight ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved bigger re@@ mun@@ itions in the BMI ( 7.4 vs. 5.1 % ) and hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded a complete overhau@@ l of the diabetes ( 4@@ 6.9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study shows the survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of severe people in Sweden , that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was subjected to ob@@ ese people who subjected to o@@ bes@@ ity surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group compared to conventional methods .
although the new study did not benefit the survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said that it is soo@@ thing for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it claims that this operation in this lower BMI group is lower , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight as soon as the patient lies with its BMI between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait for a long time until we make people to take this thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think once these genetic changes have been accounted for to have their bodies related to o@@ bes@@ ity and diabetes , a recur@@ ring is really hard . &quot;

even though the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to ap@@ preh@@ end the crisis , he emphas@@ ized that it was only temporary solution .
&quot; in order to take care of several thousand refugees , it is wonderful but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions such as a real peace and genuine development , mainly by education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; he stressed .
ultimately , we must remember how the killing in their countries is decreased .
we have to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; violence has never resolved to solve these problems , &quot; he added .
the Dalai Lama said the problem of violence and commented Dr. George Bus@@ h@@ s for action after the terrorist attack on September 11 and turned out that the violent reaction of the US attracted a chain of un@@ controlled events .
after September 11 I explained my side effects in a letter to President Bush , and I said to him , the way to the solution of this problem is non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know , his moti@@ fs were good , but he sat down violence , and this has experienced unexpected consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four@@ fold increase from taking @-@ in @-@ disinfection products by children in the last 4 years
po@@ ison control centers in the USA reports about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of twelve , which swal@@ low strongly alcoholic tum@@ ours , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord L@@ op@@ ez , director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , has reported cases of sales in children under 12 years , including tox@@ ins control centers , from 3,@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; kids are more frequent in these products , and unfortunately , a percentage of them go on to the emergency , &quot; said L@@ op@@ ez CN@@ N .
he said that some children suffer it to drink , while some of them do to im@@ press her friends or press a mut@@ ation in the social media .
how to show videos on YouTube , how young ger@@ m do only drink for a cheap experience .
yo@@ ungst@@ ers have supp@@ os@@ edly mixed fo@@ ils with soft mou@@ th@@ wash , in order to receive a tough@@ er drink .
younger children can be exported by attractive di@@ ps of disinfect@@ ant .
&quot; one child doesn &apos;t think that this is bad for it , &quot; said L@@ op@@ ez .
many of the attractive ( hand @-@ disinfect@@ ant ) are those who are com@@ po@@ ised .
there are disinfect@@ ant with straw@@ berry , grapes , and orange shower , which are very attractive for children .
wall @-@ disinfection devices contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially in infants can carry a few sy@@ ring@@ zer for alcohol po@@ is@@ oning .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; told Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the Gi@@ ft@@ emergency centre in the hospital at the University of Kansas , the transmitter Fox 4 in Kan@@ sa City .
so , you would not cause si@@ p@@ int whis@@ key , but people leave this hand disinfect@@ ant in reach of children , and if children come to it , then it is a quick way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl which recently had four sy@@ ring@@ zer from after straw@@ berry du@@ f@@ ten@@ disinfection . in the school , was brought to a notice of emergency treatment .
your blood @-@ alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold of which is drunk with an adult , said Dr. Chris R@@ it@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency medical doctor who treated it at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah flo@@ d her words and was not able to go to go in when they arrived in the emergency department .
doctors supervised her over night in a separate children &apos;s hospital at the signs of Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ ma , since the girl had fallen by the alcohol and welded its head , R@@ it@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was very fear@@ ful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ ahu &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
L@@ op@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers , non @-@ alcoholic products or disinfection installations to use and ham@@ mo@@ disinfection products outside the reach of the child .
in addition to alcohol po@@ is@@ oning , some disinfect@@ ants were associated with death cases .
in 2013 , two women were killed in Ontario women according to the swal@@ lowing of ham@@ mo@@ disinfection apparatus , which had a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
employees health authorities believe that the product contained me@@ thanol , a dead@@ ly solution , instead of ethylene at the rate of ethylene .
in January , three students of the fourth class in the state of New York decided to po@@ is@@ oned their &quot; brick &quot; teacher , having obtained anti@@ bacterial products around the class@@ room , &quot; says it is a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic against ham@@ mo@@ disinfection products and banned them from their room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police looked at the ver@@ ted plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sh@@ w@@ ät@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and stated inter@@ disciplinary action to the debt authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vill@@ ingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged

there is rum@@ ours of Dish@@ on@@ mon@@ y at Cel@@ tic Glasgow , which was refer@@ enced by Griff@@ i@@ ths . this insi@@ sted that he and his team mates are not under higher control , since they prepare for the con@@ front@@ ation with the Dutch tobacco guide .
I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it .
the lack of title competition in Scottish football bo@@ dying - de Bo@@ er
former Rang@@ ers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest to Cel@@ tic , because there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the Rang@@ ers .
de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland , they show no highlights of the Cel@@ tic Games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people don &apos;t just talk about the return of Rang@@ ers .
they speak about the Old Fir@@ m .
they speak about both teams and this is what they are interested .
there is a lot of voltage at the Old Fir@@ m games , and there are not only people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn around the things , swe@@ ars D@@ eil@@ a .
R@@ onn@@ y D@@ eil@@ a has accepted that Cel@@ tic needs to fight , but the Norwegian writer swore to turn these things .
after the defeat of Malmö and the subsequent eradi@@ cation of the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ men from Aberdeen , which now points out with five points and clearly reached the top of the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ eil@@ a said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cel@@ tic had already been bad times before , and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it is very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel the same - but we will go on .
we really need the Cel@@ tic support , because that players do better .
now , it is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton careful with January transfers
despite his comments prior to his comments on a few weeks ago , the rank @-@ boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton c@@ auti@@ ously considering the signing of new arrivals , it &apos;s advis@@ able that he does not want to inter@@ rupt the unit of the I@@ bro@@ x @-@ Ka@@ ders .
the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; the January @-@ Transfer window is very different from Summer window . &quot;
players who come in the summer have this pre@@ season period to integrate themselves , which you have seen with our own group in this season .
the crew is really good .
sometimes more damage has caused by reducing the necessary player to what you really need .
Cel@@ tic @-@ target person Mich@@ u with reference ID
S@@ wan@@ sea @-@ Stür@@ mer Mich@@ u , with Cel@@ tic during the transfer period in conversation , pointed out that he could withdraw itself when his contract expi@@ res when the Sw@@ ans expi@@ res .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a Derby , and it was the heat of the moment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the stor@@ ms , and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is certainly to say that I didn &apos;t return to Ty@@ n@@ berg when it &apos;s not for Cel@@ tic Glasgow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ In@@ nes said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team that has won everything , in poker games or lifestyle , which matches the games of this type as well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while it rises in the United Kingdom .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 during the period from May to July , while the number of people in the United Kingdom died as a whole in the same period by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million .
the Scottish unemployment rate of 5.9 percent was above that of the U@@ K@@ s accounted for 5.5 percent , as presented by the Office for National Statistics ( ONS ) .
in the meantime , employment was in Scotland to 12,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12,000 .
the Employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent in the quarter - an average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;
it &apos;s nearly a year ago that Scotland has taken the historical decision to stay part of the United Kingdom .
in these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements on the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline of unemployment .

why I will be his execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
somewhat later , except with a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
if it happens , and I hope that it does not happen that I will sit in a viewer at the death chamber at the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , if Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by po@@ ison sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death .
the invitation already took place in January of his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I voted .
when the day was closer , I began to fear myself .
so , why should I do it ?
I agree because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists can see the exec@@ utions in the United States , and there are often more applications to be available , there is a more powerful lot@@ tery instead of choosing to choose who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
who will be selected will keep it emotional .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will be sitting next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps of a friend , with whom I developed my own relationship over the course of the months with telephone and two and a half hours .
I like the guy .
we often laugh at many if we speak .
the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I simply have to try to remember all details .
he journalist , from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , accused me of giving up my im@@ part@@ ess on Twitter .
here is the lesson .
let the story of the prisoner , as he wants it , and you will receive access .
I compl@@ ained about it with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she dre@@ amed that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would have been better to form@@ ulate &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she still th@@ inks that it is wrong , what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I write to write , and I would not do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants to write an international re@@ porter to write there .
when he dies , he th@@ inks that the public relations work against the death penalty will help .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter by Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , is sitting next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of Pod@@ casts that I made .
I don &apos;t want to go down to all details here .
I cannot say that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would not ow@@ e him to be an un@@ favorable relationship .
but I think there is a strong lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is no enough evidence to just@@ ify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is false .
and from this perspective I will see him .
I can not claim to be obj@@ ec@@ tively .
there will be other re@@ por@@ ters to which you can turn .
what you &apos;ll receive from me is what it means to see a man an unnecessary death .
man after mo@@ ist police pursue care@@ ers to escape from the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman remains dry when he over@@ spoke the man of the C@@ anning River .
an attempt by a man of Perth to avoid the police , was un@@ successful when he found himself in the center and sum@@ p@@ ent water , just a few meters from a police officer , trying to convert it gently to convert to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was launched on Tuesday to a house @-@ breaking fall in the pel@@ vic .
when they discovered the susp@@ ects , they tried to escape their way towards C@@ anning River .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he arose , and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not coming , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ le@@ dine . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Peter Moo@@ dy claims that st@@ ew@@ ards tried to op@@ end him and threat@@ ens the racing sports
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that st@@ ew@@ ards from Racing Victoria went to install a sp@@ y on his st@@ ables in the last year and threatened to finish the race at once .
he applied to the st@@ ew@@ ards and the integ@@ rating department of Racing Victoria and claimed that she led a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Sc@@ rat@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai on Wednesday for a race day treatment , the last Stro@@ h@@ anger on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy , Fair@@ fax Media said that he is always attempts to do what is best for racing , and he found himself under difficult conditions , when it went to the positive co@@ b@@ alt T@@ up@@ fer@@ Sample in Li@@ dar@@ is , which he could not explain .
he had held for 18 months because of the sp@@ ying @-@ stran@@ ts and did not want to see it &quot; out as high @-@ bearing grapes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have a long time to eat , but sometimes you are fru@@ str@@ ated to come out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that there departed .
sometimes it re@@ acts , and one must live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said .
I &apos;m going to go home today and sleep well .
I would like to mind the main race , and I want to think my owners , that I try my best for them .
when you start to think , I do not do that , I should be no longer trainer .
I must then think about what I do with my license .
before , Moo@@ dy had managed the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the integrity department had attempted to op@@ press his barn .
&quot; eigh@@ teen months Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart , sitting in a room with a man - whom I will be asked - and gave him a job in my st@@ ables , to supply information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on Rac@@ ing.com .
they believe that I am a che@@ er .
if that is the case , they should definitely hold on their n@@ oses , because they have failed to deal with me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , eh@@ em . President of Route L , David Moo@@ dy , President of Route L and Bernard Sa@@ un@@ dry , current CEO of Route L , were deliber@@ ately aware of its time and still exist today .
should I bring it to my opinion , that it is personally done ?
did the Route L melt and makes people responsible for people outside of train@@ ers to do what is happening in the sector ?
am I bad for the sector ?
have I been so bad for the industry ?
perhaps people think there I &apos;m .
perhaps they have to take Me my license and cast me away , and I don &apos;t doubt that what I say to think about it now .
but I have now arrived at the point where it is no matter , and this makes me sad .
that makes me sad .
I will exercise the pressure on them and thre@@ aten it to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the train@@ ee levels of train@@ ers have constructed a long @-@ lasting co@@ b@@ alt @-@ study at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate Sc@@ rat@@ ching led to that he could throw off his license on the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the unbe@@ atable champion Black C@@ avi@@ ar , the race @-@ treatment @-@ treatment rule is ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , after a pack of mud and sound had been applied to the horse @-@ deb@@ ug@@ ging against the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to assume the full responsibility &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my employees has been applied ir@@ ron@@ e@@ ously on the ball .
it would have been yesterday evening .
it would have been like yesterday the whole day , what was so .
but it was so on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be faced with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the package on the racing day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules do not know about the horse .
&quot; we all want to see that we need rules but here it is too far , &quot; said Moo@@ dy .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy proposes to ring fighting against Ri@@ vals
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy did review criticism of his player as &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League favour@@ ites of the N@@ RL .
Sydney Roo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the sole arbit@@ rator drawn up the Storm players &quot; Ring@@ ing &quot; with his team during the high Storm winner in Sydney on Friday evening .
Brisbane Bron@@ co Trainer Wayne Bennett had a little dis@@ covering to the Storm Team , after his team had achieved the final victory against North Queens@@ land C@@ ow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; model example &quot; by the Rug@@ by League and said that the two from Queens@@ land did not be &quot; good &quot; in rings .
Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team and said they were only focused on their &quot; contact &quot; at the Tac@@ kling .
Bell@@ amy added that the cr@@ iti@@ que of two leading train@@ ers in his team agree with him because it is appropriate that they worry about to be defeated by the Storm Team .
&quot; the phenomenon occurring all again - I have not heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson on Ring@@ ve spoke when she talked to us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ amy said on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that we have changed nothing in our faul@@ ty system or the techniques in the whole year . but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kl@@ es with a real focus , and that &apos;s the turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent is now for three years , and he obviously has a great team to train . he is therefore probably not used to lose it , so it was a bit of shock for him .
it is already funny as it appears again to that season .
Bell@@ amy has launched Ben@@ net@@ ic Ide@@ as from &quot; exciting football &quot; and rec@@ alls his ment@@ or that Ben@@ net@@ ts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; slow &quot; football .
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
he finished his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting your play was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
I remember that in 2010 St George was critic@@ ised as a bor@@ ing team , and Wayne said that he will take care of a she@@ ath .
but now he has a team that can play and see it as exciting , in particular his young players at their speed .
that &apos;s the ball game that you want to play this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so they can play like this .
I have strengthened their confidence , because they are saying these things , because they are a bit concerned , to play against us .
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think about us when she went about the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game was the Storm against Roo@@ sters , higher result than the game Bron@@ co vs. cow@@ boys .
the game of Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more trials in our game , but is it an exciting game ?
or do breaks do and have no points some ten@@ sion@@ ing ?
it is the sched@@ ules for me .
if you mention it , it means that we will meet in another phase .
the Storm team has been free at this weekend since they have won the right to receive either North Queens@@ land Nu@@ ow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on next Saturday evening in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin with the next morning service .
re@@ cl@@ ed with $ 200,000 Guaranteed according to drug law
a man , possibly a li@@ fel@@ ong sentence is due to the possession of about 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , which have been sm@@ iled to Queens@@ land , was released against a damage deposit of $ 200,000 .
Marko Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested the last month after the German police came from V@@ anu@@ at@@ u in South America and put on in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed when he met his co @-@ def@@ endants during the morning and later at the Café Co@@ om@@ era road@@ house in the Café Co@@ om@@ era road@@ house , where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite a possibly life sentence for the attempted , a commercial quantity of co@@ ca@@ ine , argu@@ ed the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , argu@@ ing that there was no evidence that he attempted to possess the entire amount and that in the café could have been a harm@@ less reason .
the judge of the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was wor@@ ried about the escape of the threat of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
it has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he declared the Court on Wednesday .
in case of the criminal issue , he weighed the police on his position .
Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ics &apos;s mother and step@@ father had a security deposit of $ 200,000 deemed security in order to be able to release his release .
&quot; according to reading the mature explanations of the two people it is clear that the circulation of a safety of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; said Jud@@ gment .
but it will not be sufficient to release him , but he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released on b@@ ail damages , under the conditions that he announces his Australian and his Serbian Pass , when the police arrive daily and stays on a starting from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

lock soft to small border crossing to Germany
increasingly more refugees have taken up out of the control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many locks removed from fear of discovery and capture the people remin@@ is@@ cent of smaller border cross@@ ings
at the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police came out .
along the border controls Inn , Pass@@ au and R@@ ott@@ al @-@ Inn were taken up for more than 1,000 refugees .
they were on foot over bridges and dust tube onto the German side .
there they will be taken from police agencies in reception and forwarded to the registration .
according to German police station in comparison with the weekend in Wednesday , more refugees came again on Wednesday .
some 700 people have arrived in the state capital alone until 8.00 a.m. , one speaker said in the morning .
after the introduction of inspec@@ tions on the German @-@ Austrian border on Tuesday , 17@@ 59 , refugees had reached the town .

on Friday , the sun can be seen again .
the mass will make it : every two years show the car &apos;s car at the IAA .
the car in 2015 is mainly due to its compact car , which are currently working very well .
cars from the compact class are currently asked : some 28,@@ 1 percent of new registrations were accounted for by the Federal Office ( KBA ) in August on this segment only in August .
this is also reflected at the International Commercial Vehicle Show ( Audi@@ ence Days September 17 to 27 ) .
this year , many new compact models presented the fut@@ ur@@ istic design and luxury cars between all the fut@@ ur@@ istic concept cars and luxury cars .
one of the biggest premier@@ es for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , who will stand at dealers in the autumn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann on the exhibition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he belongs to the core of the brand .
thanks to this , the volume of volume is also well sold , the new Astra will also be much more expensive .
Opel is entering a start of the biggest compet@@ itor VW Golf in the view , which starts at € 17 650 .
the current Astra will be priced at Euro 16 990 .
the Astra is available with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the Hessen also offer further diesel and gasoline engines ranging from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which also includes three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines .
unlike the most important compet@@ itor VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra will initially only be fifth .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the station , which is also visible on the IAA .
and what about the Astra at the IAA remained new in addition to the Astra ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra compet@@ itor Mé@@ gan@@ e to the race .
Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively powered by a five @-@ door wagon in a conventional and a sporty GT version .
in the trade he returns to the beginning of next year , then also as com@@ bi .
Infin@@ iti : quite new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan Ab@@ bot wants to find its position in the strong @-@ growing segment with the new model .
this is the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines fully into the design line of the brand .
the basic model will receive a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
in the offer , a diesel engine with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp are also available .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which will celebrate its world premiere in Frankfurt .

DS 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed , the compact class of the compact class DS 4 blade is to be seen at the IAA .
outside , the designer of the noble Citroën @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ator placed especially on the front part : here the radiator gr@@ ille was newly drawn and the changed head@@ lights are equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ainment system has been moderni@@ zed , reducing the number of buttons by a touch screen and first ever integrated Ap@@ ples Car@@ Play .
on the IAA in the compact class , there is a range of over@@ working and new variants , like the ris@@ ky Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 308 GT@@ I .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are human
the Federal Constitutional Court has been given an ex @-@ prisoner of the Court of Justice for Te@@ gel , which was housed in a row in a small cell .
due to the violation of its human dig@@ nity , mates are entitled to compensation in financial compensation unless they are accommodated in small cells .
this decision has chosen the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision on Wednesday .
the person affected may also hope in money if they were imprisoned only a few days in the close quarters ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus a former in@@ mate with his constitutional complaint was successfully completed in Karlsruhe , where he was accommodated in a single cell with around five square metres of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was in spatial as well .
after that , the man , who according to his swal@@ lows now , was once again on the free foot , in a larger cell .
his term of liability because of the innocent detention conditions against the land Berlin had failed .
but the Constitutional Court took up the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of Jud@@ ges and referred the case to a renewed exam .
they see the man &apos;s human dig@@ nity .
Chamber Court now decides on the amount of compensation
even if legal reasons for the un@@ question@@ ing period only a few days of liability for compensation is to be a compensation , it was said .
otherwise , &quot; a bon@@ ding of the legal protection of personality is to be feared . &quot;
the chamber must now clari@@ fy the amount of money damage .
the constitutional law have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
so , in April , they were not imprisoned in a prisoner , because he was imprisoned in a prison cell naked .
human un@@ worthy is a decision from 2011 according to the majority of one cell without separate toilet .
in addition , on Wednesday , on Wednesday , the Berlin Constitu@@ ent Court , who had been a man of conscience in a parallel strike , had agreed on a de@@ cent accommodation in November 2009 .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff @-@ pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs withdrew from 15 to 21 hours daily between 15 and 21 hours , as in the Karlsruhe Institute .
in the last few weeks the pris@@ ons were also possible because of lack of head@@ lines .
det@@ ain@@ ees will therefore remain surrounded by 23 hours , with the aggressi@@ vity itself , even to slaughter animals , due to the cl@@ amped location .
according to the notification of the pyramid there are 21 positions in te@@ gel because of a new defect , 19 should not fall in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are able to do that . &quot;
the immig@@ ration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or has decided to accept them .
what comes to Germany ?
according to forecasts made by the German Federal Ministry for Germany , about 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers are coming to Germany in accordance with the statement of Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) in Germany in a position to welcome one million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) shown in view of the unusual challenge resolution : &quot; I say again and again : we can do this , and we can do it . &quot;
what comes to Germany , gives the following overview .
these are needed , according to a variety of forecasts ranging from 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Transport ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the pest@@ el Institute ) apartments annually - and for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as previously built ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
the lack of living room is dramatic but above all in an affordable rental accommodation : 60 000 to 80@@ 000 social apartments from the rental price per year , and in order to apply these particularly inexpensive apartments to apply refugees too .
Federal Minister for Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding from currently 518 million to one billion euros .
much too little is that of the Pest@@ el Institute : 80 000 social apartments would have to emer@@ ge annually , and this would have to invest a funding in the amount of 6.4 billion per year .
in addition , scientists and Federal Minister for housing in this housing will also have a further cost advantages for investing in housing .
according to estimates by the institute for labor market and professional research , 55 per cent of poultry farmers in Germany can be employed .
however , refugees in Germany would not be asked for their qualification to help them with their qualification , Claudia introduces Walter , Project Manager for Integration and Education in Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
for the integration of refugees , however , things are decisive if they find in Germany .
work is the key for social contacts , for the value of est@@ e@@ ology , but also for the self @-@ est@@ e@@ em of immig@@ rants , says migration researcher * Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
in Germany , there has been a political turn@@ around in Germany : the prohibition of employment for refugees in respect of work .
while there was a compulsory worker for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , just as the resi@@ den@@ gue , the asylum seek@@ ers is limited to a residence .
in society - also because of the recru@@ itment of professionals , significantly the visibility of visibility must under@@ go that refugees shou@@ ldn &apos;t have access to the labour market .
a large hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are missing German .
until now there is no sufficient offering on general and professional @-@ related language courses .
studies show that jobs are most frequently arranged through personal contacts .
therefore , the construction of networks is therefore directed by Thr@@ no@@ hardt of the Königs@@ stein to the working integration .
the Berlin School Administration has found that only few co@@ iled parents spend their children in the Kit@@ as , estimated to hold 10 to 15 percent : &quot; for the ent@@ ro@@ oting parents , it is only once more important to meet the family , &quot; says Il@@ yes Ko@@ alt@@ bar , spokes@@ person for youth and family in the Senate department .
nevertheless , in order to convince the family benefits of K@@ ita the administration of hand@@ bal@@ lot in different languages .
if the demand for gu@@ ardi@@ ans too strongly rise by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate will try to increase the training capacities by increasing education in the future .
students are prepared in the countries without German and English classes .
but they are not always taught by teachers trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also taught by teachers who have only qualification in German as a second language .
there is no lack to them says Be@@ ate St@@ air@@ at from the Berlin School Administration .
the German Student Union estimates that about 20 percent of all refugees live in Germany .
princip@@ ally , no federal country asylum seek@@ ers or sub@@ du@@ ed their studies - the only exception was so far in Berlin , inside Senator Frank ( CDU ) , however , has abandoned its position as well .
study consent for refugees to be facilit@@ ated at the higher education institution .
because refugees with a residence or dul@@ ci@@ us does not receive power after the asylum seek@@ ers , when they start their studies .
the latter is generally not a B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , since they are not covered by the banks of the b@@ af@@ e .
Ged@@ ul@@ led refugees had to have lived for four years in Germany to have B@@ af@@ ö@@ g @-@ entitled to be shortened from January 1 , 2016 to 15 months .
but this tax gap must also be closed , Steffen Kra@@ k , Berlin@@ s State Secretary for Science , and the German Karlsruhe student union .
the students should immediately get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
Islam will therefore play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many is the religion important part of its identity .
the state should have gradually respect the same rights as to Islam as they have the churches , and to further develop the existing State churches authority to a new state of religi@@ ons .
important would be the creation of a islam@@ ic char@@ itable association which car@@ es profession@@ ally for the new@@ com@@ ers .
the rights belong to the rights too .
thus , the representatives of Islam have to be clear and willing to work with the state in many areas to allow certain control possibilities to re@@ load the state in many areas .
this also belongs to the read@@ iness to initi@@ ate the regime against religious foundations .
the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ zy@@ ek , expressed concern on Thursday the concern , religious conflicts could also be registered to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to issue these conflicts in Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must immediately stay their right to stay here in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk , &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he suggested to transl@@ ate the Basic Law on Arabic .
integration will be much more than a theme from the whole society in the future .
in this way , the majority company has to change ownership , discrimination and rac@@ ism .
Germany though - as a result of European decisions - as a result of a tight decade , anti @-@ discrimination and General Gender Equality Act .
but it was very slow to learn how the NSU race series showed , in the police and authorities systematically igno@@ red the rac@@ ist motif .
the same odds for all : what mig@@ ran@@ ates and the stak@@ eholder groups are not long demand for international agreement such as anti @-@ terrorism , must be reality in the coming years , if the country remains peaceful and citizens must benefit from their new citizens - to the well of all .
General , Germany is generally not able to supply medical medi@@ cally , as a physician , medical scientist Frank Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what Man@@ - Power and Capacity comes , we can do it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the day mirror . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , extra money must be flowing into the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ gom@@ ery fulfil@@ s all conditions at the registration of health cards .
the agreed services could be anticipated later with the federal states .
and in the long term , it is highly frag@@ worthy that many people with the limited performance catalog will be admitted to the asylum seek@@ ers .
otherwise , doctors make the doctors especially to create the language barri@@ ers .
so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de demonstrated that migrants are getting informed about their in@@ firm@@ ities than other patients .
not only in clinics , also in physician offices would have to pay interpre@@ ting costs .
many refugees too have been helped with more general medical centers in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with a different diagnostic view .
there are considerably more in@@ treated people among young refugees , and there are HIV @-@ En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment in the young people .
but some other diseases of the disease out@@ comes from their training , but Mont@@ gom@@ ery points out .
&quot; paras@@ ite fall or tuber@@ culosis are not so difficult to recogn@@ ise . &quot; and what the medical profession is concerned , be caused by refugees .
Syrians became a highly developed educational system , and some refugees are even doctors .
to refuse exp@@ ul@@ ting , they would have to prove their qualification and bl@@ am@@ per@@ ate their tests yet .
at least half of the refugees coming to Germany are ill , according to estimates by the Federal psycho@@ therap@@ ist ( B@@ Pt@@ K ) mental ill : most suffer from a post@@ trau@@ matic de@@ duction or depression .
especially created in refugee children , Dietrich Mun@@ z , president of the B@@ Pt@@ K .
a recently published study by the Technical University of Munich is that each of the Syrian refugee camps had become trau@@ mat@@ ised in Germany .
those who suffer from post@@ trau@@ matic de@@ interference is suff@@ iciently suffering from the so @-@ called Flash@@ back with breath@@ ability , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart @-@ rab@@ bits and dead@@ lines .
further symptoms are mal@@ icious and concentration add@@ ressing , severe scre@@ ams and emotional .
in order to prevent the symptoms most chronic , it was necessary an early treatment , decl@@ aring Mun@@ z .
however , only four percent of psych@@ ologically ill refugees have obtained a psycho@@ therapy .
although the psych@@ ologically ill asylum seek@@ ers can put an application for psycho@@ therapy in the social offices , but the treatment lasts usually several months .
in addition , there would usually be non @-@ skilled workers or doctors who are not trained to mental illness , whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this lead to fault valu@@ ations , says Mun@@ z .

Sim@@ bab@@ w@@ es Robert Mug@@ abe beha@@ ves wrong speech in Parliament
Mr Mug@@ abe in Africa &apos;s oldest leader fell down the stairs in the beginning of the year .
it was wounded , but the tool spread rapidly over the social media .
the Parliament &apos;s opening was also alleged by the claim of M@@ EPs from the opposition that they would have been warned of anonymous death thre@@ aten , and they have been warned of support Mr Mug@@ abe with Bu@@ h@@ ke .
last month they brought him out , and during his speech to the State of the Nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man of the movement for Democratic Change ( movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) Inno@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven Opp@@ os@@ itions politicians have received SMS messages to their cell phone that they were before dis@@ rupt Mr. Mug@@ abe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said re@@ por@@ ters in Mug@@ ab@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they war@@ ns the members of the Parliament representing the immun@@ ity in parliament , and soon as they leave the parliament , its parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective .

H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard becomes up to 30.000 jobs
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to re@@ build 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the scope of restructuring and savings efforts under the company &apos;s services .
in this year , HP is split into two listed companies and split the computer and printers business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and its service operations .
the expected career reduction will lead to a load of more than 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP said in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will be a competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard @-@ Enterprise &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chairman and Chief Executive Officer , leading the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will focus smaller and stronger than it HP today , and we have a wide range of businesses that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than 50 billion US annual sales and will be focused on providing an integrated technology solutions for companies so far as a corporate statement .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard , whose Palo Alto garage man has called &quot; the birth@@ place of Sil@@ icon Valley . &quot;
hp has under@@ gone a massive restructuring process to cope with the return of traditional PCs on mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC producer and one of the largest U.S. high @-@ tech company , is the latest in this area that is based on the belief that tight focused companies provide better performance .
FC Arsenal @-@ Captain Mi@@ kel Art@@ eta says that team mates have to stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
W@@ enger stressed that it was only September , unless his rehabilitation after plan runs , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario isn &apos;t that Wil@@ sh@@ ere certainly wants to miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of his history , his participation in the next summer on the European Championship is still un@@ certain .
the great shame on this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had strongly terminated the last season in accordance with a separate kn@@ u@@ ck@@ le injury and then returned to its old swing during the pre@@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury is not threatened by the career , &quot; W@@ enger .
it is a bone , not a good healed .
this is no longer aff@@ air .
this was just an accident .
it did not stand in touch with its Kn@@ u@@ ck@@ les or with the injury he had previously .
it may be true from purely medical point of view , but as soon recognized , there is the associated danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it is also an un@@ pleasant pattern .
Prime Minister of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries declined 23 different ill@@ nesses of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Ar@@ sen@@ as 157 league player in the last five seasons .
the wider picture for Arsenal is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six out of eight play@@ times since 2007 / 08 .
W@@ enger accepts the potential of a devil , but Arsenal had believed that a improvement in the risk factor will last during last season .
&quot; sometimes , when you return from an injury , you have a varied time period , a time in which you need to strengthen your body and mar@@ tial force , &quot; said W@@ enger .
jack is young enough to overcome that .
I hope that his body stabil@@ ises , I &apos;m confident that he will do it and he will pass through a career of the way that he deser@@ ves .
Arsenal commen@@ ces his Champions League @-@ season on Wednesday evening at Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ lane in the coming Wednesday , and W@@ enger occupies one rotation within the team .
they have travelled to Croatia , that Math@@ ieu Deb@@ uch@@ y and Aaron Ram@@ sey travelled not to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ieu Deb@@ uch@@ y and Art@@ eta are to start .
W@@ enger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep balance and play the players who need to eng@@ age a small break break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although they are clear favour@@ ites made by group F , Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb belongs to the playing places with the largest open market effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games , after the &quot; indisp@@ ens@@ able &quot; campaign launched in the last season .
the stadium was struck in Tuesday following a earthquake which was measured on the Richter scale 3.2 .
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
in the opinion , Arsenal is that Arsenal moved the doctrine from last season with the Champions League @-@ surrender to Monaco , and remains committed by far hope to lead the association with his management to the society for his first European success .
&quot; this drive is immen@@ sely , &quot; said W@@ enger .
there have never been folded against ar@@ senal .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I have long enough in the shop to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .

the lack of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obviously , especially in respect to un@@ lock as the need for males , now has become more des@@ per@@ ate than ever before , as self @-@ morph@@ ing among young men on a 15 @-@ year warranty .
in 2013 , it was the main cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Campa@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ was ( CA@@ LM - Campa@@ ign against a her@@ ed@@ itary lives ) 2015 as the year of the man , with the aim of preparing the culture to seek help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of heart in the fight to master this challenge .
a current study of more than 2,000 high school students with de@@ press@@ ant symptoms found that , when the out@@ going suffered a suff@@ iciently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy atmosphere &quot; , its chances of sin@@ tering doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of intellectual problems thre@@ aten the risks of mental problems .
but of course , only once you have to have friends , that a friendship may work .
in the age of about social media led communication , with its main focus on substance , the in@@ medi@@ ation of the answer is often more important than an important contact .
our digital life have the need to be strong , fun and successful , doubled if indeed , in reality the isolation is dominated .
this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what Psych@@ ologists ex@@ tr@@ is@@ ic values are called , money , image , social status , all at cost of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner lon@@ ging for personal development and friendship which affects our spiritual health much more deep .
and how a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire developers fixed her , money can really not buy happiness .
the beautiful race in Friends was that this focus was on the head .
each character has not been defined by his work , but by his personality , the interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler frequent h@@ ugs , Mom@@ ents at the football club in cozy sh@@ ackl@@ es and the desire from Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can depend on any case even if they have often returned to explore completely their feelings .
as one employee of the phone past@@ oral care I declared to me : ... &quot; my hearing role for people who feel de@@ pressed and self @-@ wor@@ sen , has really shown me clearly as the smallest inter@@ actions of friends could make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us are often not able to talk with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the familiar act &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come therefore to quite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has a tremendous effect , as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Friends is one of the shows which comes to me in my mind when I try to offer long lasting growth of mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of male ti@@ red@@ ness .
so very my objective of out@@ sider status via the phone wants to help people in sight of des@@ per@@ ation also , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you attend this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ ship with the celebration of the day completely redesigned the setting , why do not take your friends to a drink in the central per@@ k .
or , even better when you see in Star@@ bu@@ cks anyone , give him a smile and tell him hello .
I never know what difference your friendship could do .
friends will be broadcast on com@@ edy Central from the beginning through the end - the total 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ ship Fest
di Maria says to help PS@@ G to cr@@ use Malmö
angel Di Mary celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hit on Malmö .
di Maria meets his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to go to Malmö .
here are the game report and the response to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani took action as Paris Saint @-@ Germain his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the Prince Park stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria reached less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League Deb@@ ü@@ ger as PS@@ G player , who brought the French master to the way , but thereafter it posted a number of occasions before finally achieved a head of a head in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Sch@@ acht@@ j@@ or Don@@ etsk also in the group A takes a strong start against the Swedish master because it is not only the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ laps , but an improvement on the way to a quarter @-@ final in each of the last three campaigns .
but while she got the points , there was no class game of Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Z@@ lat@@ an Ibra@@ him@@ ov@@ ics . he later became the game against his home town team and against the club that he started his lively care@@ ers in 1999 .
&quot; it is not easy to win home or Move to the Champions League . therefore , it is a good start to cause our enemies problems and feel relaxed , even though there are certain things that we have to answer in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; it is a good sign .
we wanted to win and we have won , although I regre@@ t@@ ted that we could not have one or two further gates . &quot;
Mr. him@@ ovic returned to Paris @-@ Team after a violation of three changes to the Paris team , which was able to hold a 2 : 2 un@@ decided on their own place to Bordeaux in the First League , but he was driven by Di Mary in the fourth minute .
the Argentin@@ ean imp@@ eller was referred to as the man whose PS@@ G was taken over to the next stage in Europe , when he entered from Manchester United States during the last month , before he finished in Marco T@@ r@@ att@@ is Pass behind the Malmö defense , before moving to Johan Wil@@ and in the long corner of the network .
however , if anyone believed that PS@@ G was a big win , it was disappointed .
Malmö , the Cel@@ tic in a Play @-@ off proposed to reach this level , stood by An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was excited a heavy opponent with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field .
but apart from a shot by Nikola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , the much of Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ he@@ avi@@ est took part in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered a little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G himself gave himself up on , with some patches with flaws and bad degrees , not least was patented by Cap@@ him@@ ovic , who was patented in the first half in the first half , after Cav@@ ani had installed him after the re@@ boot .
nevertheless , he proved much more skill when he brought his players to play , and it was a pass of Ibra@@ him@@ ovic , which Di Mary was transformed into a shooting , which was presented by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the pole .
shortly after the Cav@@ ani &apos;s second gate , finally , after the Cav@@ ani &apos;s , the second gate took off with his sixth start of the race , which gave him a left flan@@ k up with Max@@ well &apos;s left flan@@ k .
it finished all thought that Malmö in game cannot come back , and only an excellent input from Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , was able to keep the end result before re@@ amer E@@ br@@ qui@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi has stopped at the end of the game .
the trainer from Malmö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , announced later that PS@@ G played a class on his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year last year .
since then we played only in the Swedish League , which did not have the same level .
the qualification games are not sufficient . &quot;
hat from before Paris !
it was a great game of them !

&quot; I want to call people on thinking about it - who will always be the director - as they will be the figure of the Harmony , &quot; said Brown first .
the only black person , and it is a n@@ ut@@ te that is beaten up by her white pi@@ g .
the producer of the island of De@@ er White People stayed for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for the control rights to the film ; Dam@@ on said that their director &quot; will give us something that we don &apos;t want to . &quot;

so very suddenly . as I can imagine even as this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ered passed with The Hollywood Rep@@ orter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , even though he finished first at all , won &apos;t receive anything prize money .
according to the rules , money is the fastest person .

Detroit Tig@@ ers are over on Minnesota &apos;s Twin@@ s
MIN@@ NE@@ APO@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ the second half of the season was not very funny for the Detroit tiger .
in former times , they were one of the best teams at bas@@ eball , today the tig@@ ers stand on the last place in the American League of Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part on Tuesday perfectly against Minnesota &apos;s Twin@@ s with 5 @-@ 4 in target Field .
the Twin@@ s sent a chance to climb to the second American League of Wild@@ life @-@ Platz over a half of the Houston Ast@@ ros game .
for Detroit , if even for one evening , it was a return of the three letters F word that had been hard to deal with a big part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all victories have fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said tiger &apos;s manager Brad flo@@ m .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon held his early offensive support while Detroit released three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then once in the ninth place .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) dropped 6 times in the 1 / 3 shows in the n@@ nings and allowed three to us for three times .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to quit this year , &quot; Simon .
it &apos;s hard to throw in the bul@@ l@@ bars of each game , and therefore I will be concentrated in the game .
the designated tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z , when he had four hits from Seattle on July 6th .
&quot; he ble@@ w well , and he ble@@ w well . &quot; he said .
he looked good at the ( drums ) , looked clearly better out of the bul@@ l@@ do@@ z@@ ers , and he brought it directly into the game .
with three R@@ uns at the end of the seventh In@@ nings , the Twin@@ s had its best chance to come back into the game .
center F@@ iel@@ ding Byron Bu@@ x@@ ton completed the inning with a double on the left field .
the Right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks finished in a colorful , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before it was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ins Hard@@ y .
Hard@@ y out@@ run wall , the only man , con@@ fron@@ ted with which he was con@@ fron@@ ted before the Des@@ ired ro@@ ok@@ ie cutter of Miguel S@@ ano , who gained a Two @-@ Run took place in the right @-@ handed ring .
with a pair of runners and the finale to the second , the third b@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe has brought to a Double Play .
it was the major league the 27th time in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ hits beat a Double play
after Detroit added an Insurance run at the end of the ninth expected , the Wall managed a R@@ B@@ I double against the C@@ loser in Bruce Ron@@ don and posted a 5 @-@ 4 stand .
however , S@@ ano is working with three pit@@ ches for its fifth Save .
Detroit benef@@ ited from the start of the game by a still not movable Phil Hug@@ hes .
the tig@@ ers scored three yields in the first two inn@@ ings against the sp@@ y veter@@ ans , who had been kn@@ itted before the game of the injury list , after he missed out more than one month because of each back @-@ one month .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I had w@@ ished , &quot; said Hug@@ hes , &quot; but I felt happ@@ ily when I started and felt that I would create some quite good pit@@ ches in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the lead off the empty field , H@@ ush@@ es gave a single to Second B@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sey .
a Two @-@ Out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into the game , who managed a single &quot; up the middle &quot; during the first Run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z succeeded with his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the lap in the Scor@@ ing position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ ano followed with a single on the right , run another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , the threat of threat .
the tig@@ ers laid in the second , as one @-@ out double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a great blow , &quot; said Twin@@ s Manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he did not sm@@ ite them well , but he has got the right spot .
Hug@@ hes was located in a pitch @-@ count , but did not scored points in the third inning , before he was replaced by the Rel@@ i@@ ever rectangle A.@@ J.@@ A@@ etter .
at Hug@@ hes it came to three hits for six hits and a walk with four Stri@@ ke@@ outs .
note : tiger R@@ HP An@@ i@@ bal San@@ chez was out due to a violation of the puppies .
it was examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who under@@ took the shoulder of San@@ chez in 2007 .
San@@ chez , in the middle of August on the occasion of the case of injury due to shoulder straps , is scheduled to be activated on Wednesday .
with S@@ án@@ chez from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is deleted from the injuries list to start the Twin@@ s .

no diet fruit - Mang@@ os contain much sugar
Mang@@ os are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
but he who wants to take heed to its stream@@ lined line , the same often will not do anything .
because Mang@@ os contain relatively much sugar - mainly sac@@ char@@ ose .
these exotic fruit could still be healthy : in them , B vitamins and vitamins E and C. above all contained Mang@@ os but requires a lot of vitamin A and its pre @-@ press beta @-@ Kar@@ ot@@ in .
whoever e@@ ats the fruit , does vision , immune system , and met@@ abolic processes in the body .
when buying , Mang@@ os should not be too soft or to be comfortable .
the formwork color alone does not say anything about it , like the fruit is ripe - so can also taste green Mang@@ os and delicious .
you should store in room temperature and consume within few days .
then they taste pure or in sweet foods .
but a man@@ go there are also warm dishes a special note .

Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther Square
almost 500 years after the Reformation , a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz will now exist in Rome .
in the presence of city president Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino has been christ@@ ened on Wednesday a far nam@@ eless place in the park at the Opp@@ io Hill on the name of the German reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is now honoured as a German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park lies right in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the community of the Protestant Churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , priest of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome , remin@@ ded him on Wednesday that the Protest@@ ants were living in the town of the Pop@@ es over centuries as minority often only living in their faith .
with the space I become visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) as a young August@@ ine fri@@ ars at the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 reached a few months in Rome .
he received the city back then deser@@ ted for a sin .

hammer artists invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) Dor@@ n@@ enk@@ rone is one of the major works created by Ot@@ mar Alt for his bi@@ ble .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost updated the introduction and Bible texts updated .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which has now been published with magnificent pictures .
at the beginning was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , who has formulated his whole personal interpre@@ tations of believ@@ ing stories on paper and canvas in 150 moti@@ fs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and f@@ anci@@ ful forms has won the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but everything is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; fun &quot; images . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : to suit the relevant issues , this can quite work quite dark .
for three years , Ot@@ mar Alt is working on his &quot; Bible project that he has made a sub@@ jective and sub@@ jective selection from the many different themes of the book &apos; Book of books . &quot;
originated are cycles that are dedicated to themes such as way of cross , pl@@ agues , commandments or pat@@ ern@@ ity .
the same applies to several partners : this is the same applies to the Luther Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its focus on art books .
and there is especially the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who placed themselves on the basis of painting with the respective passages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Ot@@ mar Former Bible verses and transl@@ ates into current connections &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are as verb@@ al mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
it is nestled between the original bi@@ of@@ uel of Martin Luther and a passage from the artist who form@@ ulates his very personal thoughts about the particular situation .
the jew@@ ellery watch@@ strap has golden le@@ ases .
the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of in@@ tim@@ acy .
in all , emotions had all been a trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in 1940 in Wer@@ n@@ ig@@ er@@ ode and grew up in Berlin . he comes from a family who belonged to the exac@@ ting Protestant powers of Herr@@ n@@ hu@@ ter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the up@@ lifting happened even with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to res@@ ume it , in order to bear me again with the Lord &apos;s Father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second approach is to help art in faster time to grow again : &quot; the perception of imag@@ ery is seen today by Rek@@ lame , and that is loud .
symbol@@ ism is afflicted .
artists have a lot of desire and del@@ ights , things to show .
pictures have always some secret service and are not decorative .
&quot; in this regard I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt wants to leave the viewer in the images . &quot; let us act , discover and feel what strength they have : &quot; the image is looking for its counter@@ part . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost starts on Tuesday at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Kunst : &quot; I like it with his own pictures . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; old did not know about how to complete the Bible but also for him major and mysterious issues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was no co @-@ operation at eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here are the images that explains the lyrics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this text is written . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Hans M@@ öhler of Luther @-@ Verlag , this facility is an invitation to deep@@ en his life in deep@@ en and freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Images speak for M@@ öhler for M@@ öhler both ( biblical ) Language of love as well as responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas pictures - is presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be opened at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation on November 15th .
start of construction for the BM@@ X railway
plans made , place found , firm commissioned , ground @-@ gym for a circuit : one year later was almost everything ready - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X @-@ Bahn had already reached the end again .

so , hill sh@@ out up , new place - now with formal planning and request for building permit .
the approval will go down in October , the First Municipal Coun@@ cill@@ or Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bock could now communicate in the nur@@ ser@@ y and youth committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this year is more visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should be then without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further mem@@ o@@ int &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the work at the former indoor pool &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fied commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B expands its commitment to refugees to 2019 , and the Bundesliga sets a clear sign on the weekend .
the football respon@@ ds to the up@@ lifting situation in Germany and sec@@ ures politics with the tac@@ kling the underlying problems .
&quot; I hold it for the biggest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no one in principle , that doesn &apos;t go to me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must be interested in every single , this subject in the handle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B Director Wolfgang Bl@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin on 23 September , he wants to intensi@@ fy the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; I am the law office on Wednesday and meet there the State Minister , Wi@@ j@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the Chancellor . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic is certainly a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the soccer could help and get completely new .
the decisive turn@@ outs must be the policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football Association therefore has extended its refugee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Stiftung , we have ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; explained ren@@ s@@ bach at the edge of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
also some states support this program .
already this weekend , the 36 Pro@@ fi@@ ver@@ a show a clear sign when it &apos;s on the left tri@@ cot instead of the usual Spon@@ sor@@ en@@ logos ( Hermes ) will help the im@@ print &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; .
&quot; we also want to make it clear that everyone should help , wherever and how they can only , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen Sport@@ son Rud@@ i Völ@@ ler the &quot; Image &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and featured the project as &quot; self @-@ intelli@@ gi@@ bility . &quot;
&quot; the refugee drama created everyone , nobody can see . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are football @-@ gi@@ sts , no , we have to use our beam power , our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees that already have suffered so incredible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha Manager Michael Pre@@ etz &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a prominent character of the league . &quot;
on Friday , the national team of women invite 100 refugees to Halle / Saale to the European team quali@@ fier .
ren@@ s@@ bach gave the support of refugees as a &quot; a large community of German football . &quot;
that all 36 licens@@ ing could have started their own projects in their locations , be great .
likewise great is that small and smallest clubs are active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we spent that we live in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is of enormous importance , &quot; he said .
in this and the next year , the association is presenting 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees in cooperation with the DF@@ B selection and the German government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corruption discovered the whole amount for 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; reported kidney bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost bl@@ az@@ ed , was so powerful that dra@@ g@@ ged to the road - this is telling us last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also quotes the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ IW@@ O &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SAP @-@ Mit@@ be@@ fo@@ unders H@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could not follow its work .
&quot; at the beginning of October , we arrive before the Supervisory Board sitting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Roth .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old managers will be able to work and are jo@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; South German newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thurs@@ days issue ) , he will come back to Germany and lead to the software company in October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am full for SAP there , full of my job . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , I stood at all time in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and the chairman Has@@ so @-@ Plat@@ ner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer of summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to go to public with an such personal story to the public , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can happen that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s important to re@@ sign up again , if you like it . &quot;

at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund all hopes raised to a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us in the first group game of the Europa League final .
the national player will also meet the table leader of the soccer Bundesliga in du@@ el with the G@@ FK Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.00 clock / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can &apos;t go back to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el said on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundesliga match against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the Bv@@ C @-@ Coach said : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
in view of the high stress of his professionals , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its stem position to the Re@@ us position .
so he announced a change on the door@@ ke@@ epers .
therefore Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is taking place in place of tri@@ b@@ art@@ ender Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he trained at an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the world champion .
if Wei@@ den@@ ds in the future is used in all Europa @-@ League @-@ games , Tu@@ ch@@ el has left open .
he will also contest the second game with a high probability .
the expl@@ aining statement of fellow players Re@@ us , that the final entry for the Bv@@ B in the Europe League has to be that , mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l has to be re@@ compens@@ ed for : &quot; Marco is not so wrong . &quot;

Robot@@ er@@ au@@ tos : government wants a pione@@ ering role in Germany
Germany is to be the Federal Government of the vehicles of the Autos Techn@@ ological Gu@@ re@@ on@@ ites after the will of the German government .
the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the house of Transport minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which provides investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ brin@@ dt said on Wednesday in Frankfurt at the edge of the ven@@ ice IAA of a &quot; new Mobil@@ ization Age . &quot;
the automated and networked driving will raise the traffic security and ensure less mines , Do@@ brin@@ dt said .
he plans to discuss the subject also with his counter@@ part in the G7 states , who also come together with representatives of the industry .
the strategy paper of the Austrian Ministry of Transport teaches the importance of mobile broad@@ band extension and a lot of travel to digital radio stations .
the test new technology is currently generating a test route on motorway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so with the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional detention risk &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the federal government plans to inspect the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and where necessary to adjust to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Germany , Germany plans to consider that the maximum allow@@ able maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars will be raised from 10 to 130 km / h .
in addition , the Federal Government will also be used for a change in the Vienna Convention which has so far been seen as drivers .
when automated driving takes over , the car takes over the lead , the driver will travel more and more to passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that process the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving will be technically possible by 2020 .
nevertheless , vehicles on public roads are still expecting to expect until 2020 . &quot;
value added in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions in Germany estimate the authors of the study to around 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the trucks can carry more safety and efficiency in traffic @-@ traffic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the S@@ ör@@ en Bart@@ ol analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the question of liability for accidents and the security of personal data of the drivers must be clari@@ fied in clearly .
but the German sel@@ f@@ driving cars don &apos;t see more sk@@ ep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
one on Wednesday at the AA road@@ survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the D@@ EK@@ RA study comes to the result that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous cars are expected to pass over the next 10 years , 32 percent are expected to do at all in 20 years .
in France , 21 percent of those surveyed by 2025 are on autonomous cars , 33 percent in the USA .
the drivers in Germany are not ready to rely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
only seven per cent would agree to the collection of the Digital Library of B@@ IT@@ KO@@ M which would give control during the entire trip on all roads .
on the highway that could introduce a 15 percent continuous traffic in the flowing traffic , at St@@ au 45 percent .
good each V@@ ed would leave the car under no circumstances .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the guys experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are strong enough , even without Timo the title , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said German coach Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ ner during the EM &apos;s teaching in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ oll was located at this time on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsor@@ ing hand in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected to be back on Friday .

Gaul@@ tier feels to become an en@@ f@@ ant for an en@@ f@@ ant .
it &apos;s a mixture of very large Mo@@ den@@ schau and a qu@@ ake piece of qu@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul Gaul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich on Wednesday .
the highlights : display man@@ ne@@ qu@@ in mol@@ ds , which seem to be human in particular thanks to video proj@@ ections .
they carry the spectacular cre@@ ations of the French designers , amongst others with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits to the big star of fashion scene - and there@@ with , he put on men in flo@@ ats .
&quot; I can no longer say that I am the en@@ f@@ ant of the Haute C@@ out@@ ure because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier it was easy , so it &apos;s really &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gaul@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from the 18th of September to the Kunsth@@ alle of the Hyp@@ o Cultural Foundation , it is a fortune that has changed his original position to a look at a show over his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; unless he had been on it , for : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me there was a bit like death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection was previously made during the Canadian Montreal and Paris station in Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is much more than just beautiful ra@@ iment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it leads to tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into this man &apos;s scar@@ cely evident work , which has written the fashion history without ever having completed a training .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not built , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ed complete art work , for which much effort was operated : to increase the d@@ olls , become an example of a styl@@ ist involved .
14 tons of materials have m@@ apped the gir@@ ders according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
shortly before the launch of the Okto@@ ber@@ fest we had a special sh@@ utter : a leather p@@ less out@@ fit with a cord .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he was always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are wound up as men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , said Gaul@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Gaul@@ ti@@ ers old Teddy is also in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , p@@ liable video effects of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good pup@@ il and bad in football ) , having put on his Teddy B@@ HS and clothes , Gaul@@ tier said .
with one doll to play , his parents could not have allowed him .
the dra@@ fting of fashion is applied later by itself .
he st@@ ole fashion journ@@ als and saw the designs of other designers such as the Gaul@@ tier in Munich .
I later bought it , however .
for his first own mo@@ vers , he did not pay the models .
they got nothing , but they were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewel@@ s instead of Gard@@ ine - Pl@@ au@@ ted tip than fashion nut
previously , it started to make the long embroi@@ der@@ y machines in and around the forest , so that they can do so .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips developed in large amounts for customers , for example to bl@@ ank@@ ets and curtains .
today , that alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , as managing director of the contrac@@ ting seats .
instead the fashion is important .
at the beginning of the Pl@@ au@@ ener , fashion gave a larger role in fashion , was pushed back by the home textiles industry - and is now re@@ discovered as niche .
Rein@@ hardt lists several examples : top in jewelry , for accessories such as bags and regional tra@@ des .
at all , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , linked to a distinctive pec@@ uli@@ arity , is an increasing contrac@@ ting potential .
if anyone has no niche in the textile industry in Germany , it is no longer a market .

EU wants to double the mercury limit in pir@@ b@@ fish
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large space @-@ fishing and consumers thus reaching a significantly higher dose of the nerve .
the consumer organization F@@ ood@@ watch , who is a corresponding working document in the EU , critic@@ ized the plans : &quot; risks and side effects were missing with full force of sw@@ ings and infants , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt from F@@ ood@@ watch .
Wolf@@ sch@@ midt puts to increase the limits of nerve gi@@ f for large fish at the end of the food chain like about Hai@@ - or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish from &quot; economic reasons &quot; of one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram of fish .
large smoking @-@ fish are already too strong with mercury , that , on the basis of still existing limits , approximately 50 per cent of the catch must not be sold .
according to dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.5 percent would be available .
in return for this attrac@@ ting , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten limit values with other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram .
F@@ ood@@ watch called these as &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller pe@@ fish , like some car@@ p mostly as low as low as low , that they already comply with the planned maximum values already today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lowering of the cl@@ utch is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de di@@ stra@@ ction man@@ oeu@@ vre that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal @-@ rich man , which is concerned about the food chain , especially in the cat@@ fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore war@@ ns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ations of the nerv@@ ous system can cause &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cause &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Ministry of Environment explained on its homepage with regard to the current maximum values , however , that a &quot; health haz@@ ard of the population &quot; would not be expected .
mercury could get to the environment mainly through coal combustion .
the German coal plants run according to a written information from the Federal Ministry of Environment to the Green Bundestag , Ann@@ alena Ba@@ er@@ bo@@ ck ordered more than six tons of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total assets em@@ itted in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish is around in River Elbe , Rhine and the Danube . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Der Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had been cited in March from the paper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the war@@ nings of mercury in fish already told the most common health risk in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
