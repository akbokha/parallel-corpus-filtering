&quot; the organization , the community and the states work together , as far as any contractual party is concerned to facilitate the implementation of the measures envis@@ aged in this Convention ; they avoid unnecessary double @-@ work in the field of backup measures . &quot;
&quot; the backup measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be done so that they represent a ) no disability present for economic and technological development in the community or for international co @-@ operation in the field of peaceful nuclear plants , including the international exchange of core material ; &quot;
&quot; B ) does not constitute an in@@ consequ@@ ential intervention into the peaceful nuclear plants in the community , particularly in the operation of the plants ; &quot;
C ) with the in@@ spec@@ tions of a contro@@ versi@@ al operation in harmony as it is necessary for the economic and ris@@ kl@@ ess implementation of nuclear activities .
&quot; a ) The organization meets all arrangements to protect business , and industrial goods , as well as other confidential information , of which they have gained knowledge in the implementation of this convention . &quot;
&quot; II ) summar@@ ised information about core material , the backup measures subject to this Convention is to be affected by the Council and consent of the directly affected states or the community , as far as each of the two parties is affected . &quot;
&quot; a ) At the implementation of backup actions after this Convention , the technological development is carried out in the field of backup measures , and it will all efforts made to ensure optimal cost effects and applying the principle of effective backup of the flow of core material that is subject to this agreement and other technical processes at certain strategic points , as far as the current or future technology this will be possible . &quot;
B ) For warranty of optimal cost effects are applied for example by the following techniques : I ) spatial F@@ ing@@ r@@ enz@@ ung as a means to define the material @-@ zones for the account@@ ability ;
&quot; III ) conc@@ ise the follow @-@ up procedures for the phases of fuel circular flows , which could be made , processing , processing , use and storage of core material , out of which without further nuclear weapons and other core processes , provided that this Agreement does not hin@@ der the implementation of this convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) For effective implementation of the Security measures to this Convention provides the community of organisation in accordance with this Convention Information about core material , the backup measures , and about the features of the systems that are related to the implementation of securing measures . &quot;
B ) The organization requires only the minimum level of information and data that is compatible with the implementation of its tasks on this Convention .
&quot; II ) Information about plants will be limited to the minimum level , which is subject to the use of backup measures in relation to core material that is subject to securing measures according to this Convention . &quot;
&quot; ( C ) At the jud@@ ging of the Community , the organization is ready to consider the community as particularly vulnerable to consider the community in the premises of the community . &quot;
&quot; we do not need to become a materi@@ ally applicable , provided that they will remain available for further examination by the organization in the premises of the community without further accessible . &quot;
( a ) i ) The organization retri@@ eves the approval of the Community and the states to c@@ iting in@@ spec@@ tions for the States .
&quot; II ) raises the community either against a proposed nam@@ ing or anything at any point against a result , thus the organization of the community and the states against one or more alternative approaches . &quot;
&quot; III ) If the re@@ peti@@ tive of the Community , the nam@@ ing of in@@ spec@@ tions of the organization , which is defined by this convention , the Council is called the ordination of the organization - in the following as &quot; the General Director , &quot; with the aim of meeting the appropriate measure . &quot;
B ) The Community and the affected states are taking the necessary steps to ensure that the in@@ spec@@ tions of the organization can actually be executed according to their agreement .
C ) The visits and activities of the in@@ spec@@ ulators of the organization are thus decorated that i ) the possible har@@ ass@@ ment and disorder for the community and the states and for the in@@ spec@@ tions of the peaceful nuclear plants as low as possible ;
II ) The protection of industrial nations and other the in@@ spec@@ tions of the organization to be aware of the confidential information is ensured .
&quot; each State is facing the organization , including its assets , means and assets , as well as compared to their in@@ spec@@ tions and other officials , the responsibilities of the agreement on the prer@@ og@@ ative and liber@@ alisation of the International At@@ omen@@ on organization . &quot;
&quot; the backup actions after this Convention are termin@@ ated in terms of core material , if the community and the organization may notice that the material is used or processed in a way that it is for a nu@@ cl@@ e@@ ars activity , which is no longer usable or virtually in@@ im@@ itable . &quot;
&quot; the Community noti@@ fications of the organization according to the provisions of this Convention is the transfer of core material from the states , which is subject to the management measures according to this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the backup actions after this Convention are termin@@ ated in terms of core material , as soon as the recipient state , as is envis@@ aged in this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the organization carries documents , from which any disclosure and if necessary , the re@@ use of the backup measures goes on the further kernel material . &quot;
&quot; should core material , the backup measures to this Convention is subject to non @-@ nuclear activities , such as the production of al@@ loys or ceramics , used , so agreed the community with the organization of such use of material , under which circumstances the backup measures can be termin@@ ated in relation to this material . &quot;
II ) That the material &apos;s material during the duration of the non @-@ application of securing actions after this Convention is not used for the production of nuclear weapons and other core bodies .
&quot; B ) The organization and the Community meet a regulation , that the backup measures envis@@ aged in this Agreement shall not be used as long as the core material used in such activity . &quot;
&quot; in the regulation as far as possible , how long and under which circumstances these backup measures will not be applied . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the backup measures will again be applied once again , as soon as the core material will be carried out again in a peaceful nuclear action . &quot;
the organisation is held over the total and composition of this in the respective country or the states concerned and on any distribution of such material from this state or these states .
&quot; this explains its consent as quickly as possible ; it extends only to matters such as time @-@ time and proc@@ essions for reporting , however , does not include a summary , or among the secrecy of the military activity , and also refers not to the following use of the core material . &quot;
&quot; the organization , the community and the states bear the costs involved in each of them in carrying out their obligations arising from that Convention . &quot;
&quot; the community , the states or individuals who are subject to their territory , however , the extraordinary cost as a result of a special investigation of organization , thus ref@@ unded by the organization these costs , provided that they have explained in advance . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the organisation carries the costs of all additional measurements and sampling possible by the in@@ spec@@ tions of the organization . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the states are certain that the liability insurance for nu@@ cl@@ e@@ are damage , including insurance or other financial security , according to their laws and other financial security , can be used for the purpose of implementing this convention in the same way as on the nationality of the states . &quot;
&quot; any claim that the community or the state against the organization or the organization towards the community or a state due to damages , resulting from a nuclear incident occurring - as@@ sert that are regulated in accordance with international law , is governed in accordance with international law . &quot;
&quot; if the Council has been determined by the Director of the General Secretary @-@ General Information , that the organisation has not been able to verify it by post @-@ testing , that no core material that has been eff@@ ected after this Convention and may take part in Article XII and other core @-@ related reports , and may also take the other measures envis@@ aged there . &quot;
&quot; in such steps the council , in which mass has been att@@ ained by the applied security measures , and provides the community or the state - as far as each of the two parties is concerned - each issue in order to give the advice the necessary security . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for organizing the organization , the community or of a State consultations on issues that arise from the interpretation or application of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the states are entitled to seek , that matters that arise from the interpretation or application of this Convention , by the Council . &quot;
the council invites the community and the affected state to participate in the discussion of such questions by the council .
&quot; with the exception of any dispute arising from the Council to Article 19 or by the Council , disputes arising out of the interpretation or application of this Convention and which may not be included in the negotiation process or by another of the organization , the Community and the States association agreement , which consists of five arbit@@ rators . &quot;
&quot; the community and the states are ren@@ ame two arbit@@ rators , the organisation also bur@@ ns two arbit@@ rators , and the four so @-@ called Ar@@ bit@@ ors elect a fifth , which leads the chairman . &quot;
&quot; the community and the states or organization of binding three days after the request for an arbit@@ ration are not only two arbit@@ rators , thus the community or organisation of the President of the International Court of Judgment . &quot;
the same procedure is applicable if binary three days after the appointment or appointment of the fourth bit@@ er of the 5th arbit@@ rators was not yet selected .
&quot; a majority of the arbit@@ ration of the arbit@@ ral tribun@@ al shall be protected , and all decisions require the approval of at least three arbit@@ rators . &quot;
&quot; the decisions of the arbit@@ ration are binding for the organization , the Community and the countries concerned . &quot;
&quot; a ) This Convention shall be held responsible for non @-@ prolifer@@ ation @-@ states , the contracting party of the contract and members of the Community shall be in force , i ) if the relevant state of the organization noti@@ fies that its procedures are completed for the entry into force of the Convention . &quot;
II ) if the community of organisation noti@@ fies that they are able to apply their backup measures in relation to this state for the purposes of this convention .
a ) The Organisation , the Community and the States consult each other on the search of any of the contract parties on a change in the Convention . &quot;
&quot; B ) All changes require the consent of the organization , the Community and the States . &quot;
C ) The General Director has taught all Member States of the organization immediately from any change in the Convention .

B ) This Convention remains as long as the European party &apos;s party .
the term &quot; agreement used in this agreement &quot; means the agreement and the protocol .
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine under the implementation of the provisions of the section I on securing measures as required .
the aim of the procedures established in this Convention is the timely discovery of the gradient significant quantities of peaceful nuclear plants for the production of nuclear weapons and other core practices for non @-@ known purposes as well as the det@@ er@@ rent of such a desc@@ ending by the risk of early discovery .
&quot; for the realisation of the in article 28 fixed targets , the material accounting will be used as a backup of fundamental importance , verbal and monitoring as important complem@@ entary measures . &quot;
the technical conclusion of the tests performed by the organization is performed by an explanation in which for any material balance zone which is listed for a specified period of time under indication of the accuracy of the accuracy .
&quot; when performing their test tests , the organisation makes for an article 3 full use of the community . &quot;
the accounting and control system of the Community for core material according to this Convention is based on an outline in the material of material zones .
&quot; in applying their backup measures the community of de procedures and measures will make use of the following way , and as far as required , as required , as they are in the complem@@ entary down@@ war@@ ations and are required : &quot;
&quot; a ) a measuring system for the detection of quantities of hal@@ ogen@@ ated , flo@@ cked , lost , lost , lost , or in other ways out of the continu@@ ance of remote material and the inventory ; &quot;
B ) the evaluation of re@@ produ@@ ci@@ bility and the accuracy of the measurements and the assessment of the measuring security ;
C ) Procedure to determine the evaluation and evaluation of differences in the measurements of sender or recei@@ vers ;
e ) Procedure for the evaluation of assu@@ res not adequ@@ acy stocks and non @-@ measured losses ;
&quot; F ) a protocol - and reporting system , which indicates the core material and the changes of this stocks , including one - and outputs of the material balance zone ; &quot;
g ) Pre@@ revers@@ als to ensure that the accounting procedures and agreements are correctly carried out ;
h ) Procedure for the re@@ imb@@ urs@@ ement of reports to the organization in accordance with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
&quot; after this Convention , the backup measures extend not to material in mining or for the processing of the processing . &quot;
&quot; B ) is Ur@@ an - or th@@ ori@@ ental material that has not reached under letter C ) , which is not yet achieved in the states , so shares the community of organization the quantity and composition of the material as if it is not introduced to specific non @-@ nu@@ cl@@ e@@ are purposes ; &quot;
&quot; C ) leaves core material that is suitable for composition and purity for fuel production or the procedure phase , which is manufactured or process material or else , in a later stage of the core @-@ burning kernel material into the states , so it is subject to the other in this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The provisions set out in this Convention are termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions stipulated in Article 11 . are the community , however , that the recovery of core material , the backup measures is not possible or desirable , so consult the organization and the community each other about the use of appropriate backup measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The backup measures envis@@ aged in this Convention are termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions stipulated in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community are cons@@ enting that this core material is practically not refundable . &quot;
upon request of the Community the organization releases the following core material from the precau@@ tions following this Convention :
a ) special sp@@ in@@ able material when used in grams or smaller quantities as a sensor in instruments ;
&quot; B ) nuclear material , if it is used with non @-@ nuclear actions after Article 13 , if such a core material is reco@@ vering . &quot;
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with a is@@ ot@@ open@@ con@@ cent@@ ation of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 238 that is more than 80 % .
&quot; upon request the community liber@@ ates nuclear material that would otherwise be subject to secure actions after this Convention , provided that these backup measures , provided that the entire , due to this article in the states liber@@ ated core material quantity at no time is more than &quot;
a ) a total of a kil@@ ograms of particular material that can consist of one or more of the following materials :
&quot; II ) Ur@@ an with a enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) , and on , rede@@ emed by the multip@@ lication of its weight , &quot;
III ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ing that lies under 0.7 ( 20 % ) and above Natur@@ uran expects multip@@ lication of his weight with the fifth square of enrich@@ ing ;
B ) a total of ten met@@ ric tons of natural uran and a conf@@ lic@@ ated urine with an enrich@@ ment of more than 0.@@ 005 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty met@@ ric tons lined with an enrich@@ ment of 0.@@ 005 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
&quot; should be fre@@ ed core material along with core material , which is subject to the backup actions after this Convention , processed or stored , so will be taken for re@@ use of the backup measures on the material . &quot;
&quot; the community meets with the organization of supplements which is required in the scope , which is required for the successful and effective encour@@ agement of the tasks of the organization after this Convention , in the individual , as described in the agreement defined in the Convention . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the supplem@@ entation can be modified or modified without amendment of this convention between the organization and the community . &quot;
&quot; the supplem@@ ental inter@@ rup@@ tions are entering into force simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force . the organization , the Community and the states are taking into force all efforts , to enter these agreements within nin@@ ety days ; an extension of this period requires an extension between the organization , the community and the states . &quot;
&quot; the organisation represents a summar@@ ized assessment of the entire , environmental measures of this Convention on the United States , regardless of its origin , regardless of its origin and results on the following reports and results of their check@@ ups . &quot;
&quot; between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) and the International Development Organization ( Organisation ) &quot;
&quot; in ER@@ WA@@ Y NA@@ CH@@ STE@@ H@@ EN@@ DER reasons - a ) The EEC has decided to contribute to the European Economic Co @-@ operation program , to help the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is hin@@ dered by general res@@ our@@ ation problems . &quot;
&quot; C ) It is the objective of the EEC and Member States , that the whole of the Member States entered into force , and as far as possible within two years after the entry into force of the agreement , and the organization will be achieved , so that this goal is achieved . &quot;
D ) The EEC and the organization have consult@@ ed each other on the proposed implementation and administration of this agreement and the central connections to ensure a broad and balanced geographic distribution within the framework of this agreement .
&quot; for this purpose the organisation of the EEC has presented a table , which is clearly stated in which agreement is intended to apply the criteria established in this agreement - &quot;
&quot; the organization sets out a special account under the name &quot; &quot; special &quot; &quot; account &quot; , &quot; which is managed by the Member States pursuant to this agreement on the special reaction account ; this account is referred to as administr@@ ators in this agreement , and only to the agreement established in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement . &quot;
the special shareholder account is guided separately and separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
&quot; the contributions are as follows : a ) The payment shall be paid in the form of cash or un@@ preced@@ ent deb@@ tor , which are to pay at the desire in the currency of the organisation of the organisation as managing director of the organisation as managing director of the organisation in the relevant country . &quot;
&quot; B ) The payment shall be made in two install@@ ments , namely i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . its contribution within 30 days of entry into force of the agreement or to another between the EEC and the administrative agreed at the time ; &quot;
II ) the second in the amount of the balance to 1 . January 1979 or another time that agreed between the EEC and the car@@ et@@ akers with regard to the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) E@@ ach Member State may afford to make payments before the above dates .
&quot; the car@@ et@@ aker takes part in accordance with the usual procedures of the organization of dis@@ proportion@@ ate accordion to the cash or the school@@ ing , to cover the issues for the special reaction loan , and to equi@@ voc@@ ate the special action account in a reasonable manner . &quot;
&quot; in the gran@@ ting of this loan , the st@@ ew@@ ards can be guided in accordance with the terms of the EEC by following factors : &quot;
III ) The scope of the international economic factors have contributed to the current and fores@@ ee@@ able economic problems of the country ;
VI ) the composition and the tendency of the debt level of the country and its further credit entrance capacity at Dar@@ leh@@ ens@@ ource on Dar@@ leh@@ ens@@ ation ; and
VII ) The size in which the problems of the concerned countries can regulate through contributions from other sources .
&quot; every special reaction loan serves to finance a clear and rapidly paid development programme or pre @-@ paid development programme or not , according to the procedures and practices , which is approved for the promotion of organization of funded development loans , approved and managed by letter ( b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement as the purpose of addi@@ ction . &quot;
&quot; the means of the special shareholders must not be used instead of a decent means of the International Bank for Recon@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the organization , which have been approved by the directors of the Bank or the organization on the day of entry into force . &quot;
&quot; apart from section 4 are subject to special response to the same payment conditions , which apply for the organization granted by the organization ; they are therefore payable at ten free years in 50 years . &quot;
the loan agreement will be granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and is refundable in these currencies .
&quot; amounts to the payment of this di@@ dial , are immediately available to the organisation that re@@ tains it . &quot;
&quot; every special response loan is given by a separate loan agreement between the beneficiaries , and the st@@ ew@@ ards , in which , in particular the origin of the means is stated . &quot;
&quot; the revenue from each special reaction loan can be used for edi@@ tions in the currency of the beneficiaries , or for goods or services , which are produced by the organization ; ii ) in developing countries , the members of the organization are defined and the agreed upon which the st@@ ew@@ ards have specified at the time of the loan granted to the time of the loan granted . &quot;

the car@@ et@@ aker teaches up to the complete publication of all special response loan granted by the EEC concerning the audit by the directors in preparation and by the directors used by the directors and programmes .
&quot; during the time of the payout of the special response loan , the govern@@ ors has taught the EEC as a year on the development of the speci@@ alization loan and the event@@ ual spending . &quot;
the managing director transm@@ its from the EEC as soon as possible after completion of the financial year of the organization with an exhaus@@ tive invo@@ icing of the organization with an opinion of the external machines of the organization on this account .
after full payment of the special reaction loan from the EEC as soon as possible a detailed report on the project funded by the special action @-@ onto @-@ funded projects and programs .
&quot; the car@@ et@@ aker creates and performs suitable records and billing , from which the contributions received on the special reaction account that entered into account balance and paid out of the account amounts and the withdraw@@ als to the member states are visible . &quot;
the EEC and the car@@ et@@ aker work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
&quot; to do this , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the st@@ ew@@ ards up to the full issue of the special transaction accounts , the advancement of the programme of the special transaction accounts , the advancement of the programme with special response @-@ funded programs or projects and on all other questions , which affect the provisions of this Agreement . &quot;

&quot; and DI@@ E Swiss E@@ id@@ gen@@ ossen@@ schaft , listed below , is called &quot; &quot; Switzerland &quot; , &quot; represented by the Swiss Bundes@@ rat , listed below &quot; Bundes@@ rat , &quot; &quot;
&quot; this program includes the creation of a large pilot plant , the project J@@ ET ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation of a common company after chapter V of the Euratom treaty - is listed below &quot; &quot; Common Company J@@ ET &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Switzerland has been dealing with research in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and the plastic map@@ hy@@ si@@ c and is well acquainted with the particular area .
&quot; since the practical use of the controlled kernel fusion is still extensive works , it is in the interest of the contract parties to avoid un@@ iting efforts , to avoid unnecessary super@@ vis@@ ors and to gain their respective research , which has achieved greater pri@@ ori@@ ental degree due to the energy crisis . &quot;
&quot; this agreement will enable every contracting party to work in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and the plastic map@@ hy@@ si@@ k from the required benefits to avoid unnecessary barriers , and accordingly the common objective of this research work , i.e. the cost @-@ effective electri@@ fication generation by using the controlled kernel sound extraction , faster to achieve . &quot;
&quot; to achieve the goal of the present agreement , the contractual parties associated with their respective in Annex I and II of this agreement , &quot; &quot; Euratom program &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Swiss program &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; in the opening of the loans , as well as with its possible extension the BI@@ Z would charge a credit opening . &quot;

in the form of a brief@@ ing between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine Republic concerning the trade with Ham@@ mel and L@@ amm@@ ans
&quot; I congratulate myself , on the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to define rules on imports of Ham@@ mel , Lamb , and goat meat from Argentina into the European Economic Community in connection with the use of common market organisation for sheep - and goat meat through the community . during the course of these negotiations , the two parties are shown as follows : &quot;
- fresh or frozen ham@@ mel - lam@@ b - and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ;
&quot; as part of this agreement , the export possibilities for Ham@@ mel - , lam@@ b - and goat meat from Argentina according to the community on the following annual amount is set : 20 000 tons , expressed in swal@@ low weight ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; to ensure a proper functioning of the agreement , to ensure Argentina , through suitable procedures that the actually generated annual amount does not exceed the agreed quantity , and executed according to the conventional supply forms ( frozen or cool@@ ed ) . &quot;
&quot; should change the supply form as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties agreed to each other prior to the introduction of such change in the number 10 mentioned committee to find an adequate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the communion takes the protective clause in claim to carry out , that in this agreement , access to Argentina &apos;s access to the community market is not touched . &quot;
&quot; in the event that initi@@ ates from Argentina into one year the agreed amounts , reserves the right to dep@@ loy the right from Argentina for the rest of the year . &quot;
the community comm@@ its itself to restrict the exhaus@@ tion on immigrants from this Agreement on a sc@@ ary sentence of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ o@@ rem .
&quot; when entering new Member States , the community in consultation with Argentina will change the number 2 fixed quantity according to the extent of Argentin@@ ean trade with any new member state . &quot;
the obj@@ ections for this new Member States shall be set in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; this is supported by number 5 mentioned Ho@@ ech@@ st@@ ment of the exhaus@@ tion .
the total number 2 above the total amount will be determined by the day of accession to the Community to 23 000 tons of batt@@ leg@@ ged body .
the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development that could affect the marketing of Argent@@ ine Ham@@ mel - and fl@@ amm@@ atic on the common market within the agreed quantities .
&quot; in particular , the community moves , thus the paragraph of inter@@ ven@@ ing states of frozen meat due to the execution of the regulation of the paragraph of Argentin@@ ean Ham@@ mel , and L@@ amm@@ als not under@@ mines . &quot;
