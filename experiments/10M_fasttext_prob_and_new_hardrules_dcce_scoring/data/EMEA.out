this document is a summary of the European Public Ap@@ pear@@ ance Report ( EP@@ AR ) which has been explained as the Committee for Human@@ arz@@ tend ( CH@@ MP ) which has carried out studies in order to make recommendations concerning the use of the drug .
&quot; if you need more information about your disease or treatment , please read the pack type ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or consult your doctor or a pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you want more information regarding the recommendations of CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , than 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg melt ( tablets that take up in the mouth ) , as a solution for inser@@ ting ( 7.5 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; wir@@ res thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing of things that are not present ) , distr@@ ust and ins@@ ets ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a mental illness , in which the patients man@@ ic Ep@@ iso@@ den ( periods ) altern@@ ately with periods of normal mood . &quot;
A@@ bili@@ fy is used for the treatment of severe to severe man@@ o@@ episodes and prevention of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed past medicine in the past .
injection solution is used for rapid control of un@@ disturbed un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders if the or@@ ale intake of the drug is not possible .
&quot; in both diseases , the solution to take , or the mel@@ ting tab@@ let@@ tes in patients may be applied to those the swal@@ low of tablets difficulties . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are being able to take different medicines , the same as A@@ bili@@ fy , the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy needs to be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; this affects the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itters , i.e. chemical substances that enable communication of nerve cells . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l probably works mainly as a &quot; parti@@ eller Ag@@ on@@ ist &quot; for the recept@@ ors of neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itters D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also Ser@@ ot@@ onin ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l like 5 @-@ Hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and D@@ op@@ amine , but in less than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itters has an effect to activate the recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; since D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin is a role to play Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , causing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and it will occur . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy , to prevent the re @-@ occur symptoms , was investigated in three studies of up to one year . &quot;
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies at 8@@ 05 patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or similar diseases which sl@@ ed at st@@ amp@@ ed un@@ rest over a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy over twelve weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo , to prevent recovery in 160 patients where the man@@ ic symptoms were already stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study on 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that sh@@ ou@@ ted by Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ic ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
&quot; in all studies , the change in symptoms experienced by patients based on a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who spoke on treatment . &quot;
the company also led studies to investigate how the body relie@@ ve the mel@@ ting tab@@ let@@ tes and the solution to initi@@ ate ( recorded ) .
&quot; in the two studies with the injection solution , patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy in doses from 5.5 mg , 75 mg or 15 mg , a significant stronger reduction in symptoms ha@@ un@@ ted un@@ rest than the patients who received a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
in the application the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder decreased A@@ bili@@ fy in four of the five short @-@ term studies man@@ ic symptoms effective than plac@@ ebo .
A@@ bili@@ fy prevented by up to 74 weeks more effective than plac@@ ebo the re @-@ occur of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was additionally administered to an existing treatment .
A@@ bili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses have also slightly more effective than plac@@ ebo the symptoms st@@ amp@@ ed un@@ rest and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side @-@ effects of A@@ bili@@ fy for dispos@@ able ( observed during 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extr@@ ap@@ yr@@ am@@ id@@ ale disorders ( continuous movement ) , ax@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ) , v@@ ass@@ p@@ ation ( con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleeping disorders ) and anxiety . &quot;
the Committee for Human@@ arz@@ tend ( CH@@ MP ) contributed to the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ bili@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and medium @-@ heavy to severe man@@ ic episodes in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l assu@@ mp@@ tions in relation to the risks .
&quot; in addition , the committee came up to the result that the benefits of injection solution in the rapid control of gest@@ ures un@@ rest and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes at Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if a oral therapy is not suitable to wei@@ gh the risks . &quot;
June 2004 presented the European Commission to the Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . a permit for the transport of A@@ bili@@ fy in the entire European Union .
AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y is for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of the Bi@@ polar I@@ - disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes on treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l An@@ se ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a discount d@@ dose of 15 mg / day once daily independent of meals .
an increased effectiveness in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
&quot; the recommended starting dose for AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combined therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and Bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; with regard to the larger sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initi@@ ate dose should be considered if clinical factors to justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ in@@ duc@@ tor is set off from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the appearance of su@@ icide &apos;s behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders , and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after the change of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder , there was no increasing number of su@@ icide risks with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to other anti@@ psych@@ otic medicines . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be used with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardi@@ ac diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dinal disease or isch@@ ic her@@ edit@@ ary diseases ) , cer@@ eal prevention , treatment with ble@@ eding medicines ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ak@@ zel@@ er@@ ated and Mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) .
&quot; 3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , one year or less di@@ gesti@@ ble , there were occa@@ sional reports over during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; if at one with AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y treated patients signs and symptoms of a late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esth@@ esia , should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment . &quot;
&quot; when a patient proo@@ fs and symptoms that pointed to a m@@ ns , or imp@@ ed@@ ingly high f@@ ever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ otic medication , including AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y , must be abandoned . &quot;
&quot; therefore Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be used in patients with var@@ ic@@ op@@ ies in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese or in states , which are applied with caution with caution . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in patients with psych@@ oses that are associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , an increased ster@@ ili@@ zer compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; however , there was in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to unwanted effects inci@@ dental events with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treated patients . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with K@@ eto@@ azi@@ ce or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em Kom@@ a or death , was reported in patients who were treated with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y . &quot;
there are no precise risk estimates for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia related events with AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents treated for the direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; Poly@@ di@@ p@@ sie , Poly@@ ur@@ ie , Poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored on a regular basis regarding a deterioration of gl@@ uc@@ ose values . &quot;
&quot; a weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ ined patients and in patients with bi@@ polar Man@@ ie , using anti@@ psych@@ otic medicines , which is known as a side @-@ effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle , and could lead to severe complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ zo@@ l to the central nervous system , caution is advisable when Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ zo@@ l is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective medicines such as se@@ dation ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 Ant@@ agonist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a magnet acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ zo@@ l , whereby this effect is not relevant as a clin@@ ically not relevant . &quot;
in a clinical trial with healthy doctoral students increased a highly effective CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) the AU@@ C by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
&quot; it is expected that other highly effective inhi@@ bit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , like flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , similar effects have and therefore should be made similar dos@@ is@@ sions . &quot;
with CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) Met@@ abol@@ ism can result the joint application with highly effective inhi@@ bit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma @-@ centr@@ ations from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l resulting in comparison to CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive Met@@ abol@@ ism .
&quot; if you consider the common genes of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or other highly effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors with AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y , the potential use of potential risks to the patient should prevail . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhi@@ bit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ol and HIV @-@ Prot@@ e@@ as@@ on@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore should be done similar dos@@ is@@ sions . &quot;
after placing the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors the dosage of AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y should be lifted to the Dos@@ ish@@ ops before the beginning of the companion therapy .
Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y can be administered with a moderate increase in the Ari@@ pi@@ pel@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentr@@ ations .
in clinical trials shown doses from 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l per day does not have significant effect on the Met@@ abol@@ ism of the substr@@ ates of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ morph@@ an / 3 @-@ methodology ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( Om@@ ep@@ ra@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ ugh p@@ hic ) . &quot;
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or pregnant during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
&quot; due to the insufficient data situation for the safety of people and due to those in reproduction studies , this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential benefits are made clearly the potential risk for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , in other anti@@ psych@@ otic medicines , patients must be war@@ ned that dangerous machines , including power vehicles , to use until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has no negative influence on them . &quot;
the following side effects occurred more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) on than under plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of the side effects is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of over 52 weeks occurred in patients infected with Ari@@ pi@@ pel@@ zo@@ l , a total of lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ ins@@ on@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ is@@ ie , D@@ yst@@ onie and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients who were treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 5@@ 7,@@ 3 % ) . &quot;
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study for over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 13,@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study for over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients infected with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ zap@@ per therapy . &quot;
man@@ ic episodes at Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks was the incidence of EPS 23.@@ 5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pel@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 53.@@ 3 % in patients under Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol treatment .
&quot; in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26,@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under li@@ thium treatment . &quot;
in the long time period of over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pel@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for with plac@@ ebo patients treated patients .
a comparison between the patient @-@ groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and plac@@ ebo where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters played y@@ iel@@ ded out of any medi@@ cally significant differences .
&quot; increases the CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ ine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporarily and as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of the patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , compared to 2,@@ 0 % of the patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; among the side effects that can occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , the Mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ l@@ ep@@ tic syndrome , Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and Kr@@ amp@@ fan@@ ine , unwanted effects and increased mort@@ ality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
clinical trials and since the launch were un@@ int@@ enti@@ onal or int@@ enti@@ onal transform@@ ations with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l alone in adult patients with estimated cans of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death penalty .
&quot; although there are no information about the effectiveness of a her@@ edit@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of over@@ dos@@ ing with Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ zo@@ l ; it is however unlikely that Hä@@ modified aly@@ sis in the treatment of over@@ dos@@ ing benefits , since Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has a high plasma cutting . &quot;
it is assumed that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and Bi@@ polar @-@ I dis@@ ruption over the combination of a particip@@ atory effect on D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and Ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ ors will be convey@@ ed .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed in vit@@ ro a high aff@@ inity to the D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 recept@@ or and 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ or and 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ or and 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ or and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - for alpha @-@ 1 rep@@ in@@ ders and for hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ Reci@@ pe .

in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1.@@ 228 z@@ op@@ hr@@ ined patients with positive or negative symp@@ tom showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to plac@@ ebo a statisti@@ cally significant stronger improvement of mental symptoms .
&quot; in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled study was in week 52 of the proportion of Respon@@ ses , who held a response to study medi@@ ated in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values from the mess@@ engers , which were defined as secondary education , including PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - depres@@ sions scale , showed a significant stronger improvement than in Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study on 26 weeks of stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia showed a significantly higher reduction in the back rate , which was at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l group and 57 % below plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a O@@ lan@@ zap@@ per @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ study conducted at schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia over 26 weeks , the 314 patients embr@@ aced and in which the primary studies &quot; weight loss ( N = 18 or 13 % of the worth@@ less patient elev@@ ators ) compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg at an average weight of approx . &quot;
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l a compared to plac@@ ebo over 3 weeks .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l against plac@@ ebo no excessive effectiveness .
&quot; in two Plac@@ ebo@@ arding and actively controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed an compared to plac@@ ebo @-@ leg@@ ged effectiveness in week 3 and a sustained effect , which was comparable with the li@@ thium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l also proved a compar@@ ative share of patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ie on such as li@@ thium or hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , which were partially over 2 weeks not on li@@ thi@@ um@@ - or Val@@ pro@@ at @-@ mon@@ otherapy with therapeutic effects in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with li@@ thium or Val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ time expansion phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients , with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to plac@@ ebo superior to plac@@ ebo superior in terms of prevention of a bi@@ polar return , mainly in prevention of a return in the man@@ ie . &quot;
&quot; based on in vit@@ ro studies , the enzy@@ mes CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 for the Deh@@ y@@ dri@@ ing and Hydro@@ xy@@ ection of Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ zo@@ l is responsible , which is cat@@ aly@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
the mean Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al period is roughly 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l with exten@@ sible met@@ ering met@@ ering over CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and at approximate 146 hours at &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) Met@@ abol@@ is@@ ier@@ ers on CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
at Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l there is no differences in pharmac@@ ogen@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy tastes , as well as a pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tic examination of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia have no gender @-@ dependent effects .
a pop@@ e @-@ specific evaluation of Phar@@ mak@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics has no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences in ethnic affili@@ ation or the impact of smoking on the phar@@ yn@@ ge@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
the pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and de@@ hydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l were similar in patients with severe kidney failure .
&quot; a single dose study for promot@@ er@@ radi@@ ger Leb@@ erz@@ ir@@ r@@ p@@ ants ( Child @-@ P@@ ugh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the imp@@ air@@ ment of the liver function to the Phar@@ mak@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ sta@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but the study embr@@ aced only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their met@@ ab@@ normal capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety sp@@ har@@ ology , tox@@ icity in re@@ peti@@ tive gift , re@@ tox@@ icity , gen@@ oto@@ x@@ icity and for can@@ cer@@ ous potential , the pre@@ clinical data did not recognise any particular haz@@ ards to men . &quot;
&quot; tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed at doses or exposure to people , which clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to people , so they have limited limited or no meaning for clinical use . &quot;
the effects comprised of dos@@ ages a dos@@ ing @-@ dependent adren@@ al infections in rats for 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to the 3 to 10@@ increments of the Middle Ste@@ ady @-@ State @-@ Ex@@ position ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended Maximum Ste@@ ady @-@ State @-@ Ex@@ position ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maxim@@ al dose of people ) .
&quot; in addition , a Chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was established as a consequence of the fal@@ seh@@ ood of sul@@ ph@@ ate con@@ jug@@ ate from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1- 3@@ s of the Middle Ste@@ ady @-@ State @-@ Ex@@ position ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - up to 8@@ 1@@ in the recommended Maximum number of people based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , in the human G@@ alle with the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found concentr@@ ations of the sul@@ ph@@ ate con@@ jug@@ ate , which were found in the study on 39 weeks in the G@@ alle of monkeys , and lie far under the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vit@@ ro sol@@ ub@@ ility . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits these effects were observed after doses , which resulted in addition to Ex@@ positions of 3- and 11@@ ples of the Middle Ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose , observed . &quot;

&quot; the effectiveness of abra@@ si@@ ane was examined in a major study , attended by 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters had previously received a thr@@ thr@@ ac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine . &quot;
the effect of abra@@ x@@ ane ( in all@@ some gift or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ab@@ ide drug with ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce the side effects ) .
&quot; overall , in the main study the 72 ( 31 % ) of the 229 with abra@@ x@@ ane treated patients treated on the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 Pati@@ ents , the conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el enth@@ used drugs . &quot;
&quot; if only patients were treated with metastatic breast cancer for the first time , there were no difference between drugs and survival for the first time due to the deterioration of the disease and survival . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , during patients had received different treatments their metastatic breast cancer in terms of these indicators , that abra@@ si@@ ane was more effective than conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el sof@@ tening drugs . &quot;
&quot; it must also not be applied to patients who are breast@@ feeding , or before the treatment of low ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ phil@@ ations in the blood . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Human@@ arz@@ tend ( CH@@ MP ) presented that abra@@ si@@ ane has not suggests more effective than conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicines , and that it must not be given to other medicines to reduce side effects . &quot;
January 2008 delivered the European Commission of the Company abra@@ sive Bios@@ c@@ ience Limited A permit for the transport of abra@@ si@@ ane in the entire European Union .

in patients with severe Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie ( Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ phil@@ ology &lt; 0,50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sens@@ ory Neurop@@ athy during abra@@ sive therapy should be reduced the dose into the following series on 220 mg / m2 .
&quot; in sens@@ ory Neurop@@ athy degree 3 is the treatment to down@@ break down , until a recovery at level 1 or 2 is reached , and in all subsequent cycles a dose must be reduced the dose . &quot;
there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with mild to moderate imp@@ air@@ ment of liver function ( see Section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
there were no studies done with patients with com@@ promised kidney function and there is currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with imp@@ air@@ ment of kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
abra@@ si@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to non @-@ suff@@ iciency of the data for in@@ conceivable and effectiveness .
abra@@ si@@ ane is a Alb@@ um@@ in @-@ built nan@@ op@@ ar@@ em@@ ulation of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el which could be essentially different pharmac@@ ological characteristics as other formulations of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
&quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the drug should immediately dism@@ is@@ sed and symp@@ tom@@ atic treatment should not be treated again with p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; with the patients no renewed abra@@ sive treatment cycles were initiated , until the Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ phil@@ ology has risen again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and has risen again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l . &quot;
patients with severe liver dys@@ functions ( B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / ALT &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; while a clear with abra@@ sive tox@@ icity has not been proven , cardiovascular inci@@ dents are not unusual , especially in patients with past an@@ thr@@ ac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart disease . &quot;
&quot; if in case of patients after the gift of abra@@ sive w@@ asting , v@@ om@@ iting and diar@@ rhe@@ a , they can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ e@@ tika and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation means . &quot;
&quot; abra@@ sive should not be used in pregnant or women in child@@ bearing age , which no effective contrac@@ eption would be applied , except for the treatment of mother with p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is un@@ avoi@@ dable . &quot;
women in child@@ bearing age should apply during and up to 1 month after the treatment with abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients treated with abra@@ sive is recommended during and up to six months after treatment no child to bear .
male patients should be advised prior to the treatment of a sperm activation since the therapy with abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible in@@ fertility .
abra@@ si@@ ane can cause side effects like tired@@ ness ( very frequent ) and Sch@@ win@@ del ( frequently ) that can affect the transport system and the ability to serve machines .
&quot; below are the most common and most important inci@@ dents of side effects that occurred in 229 patients with metastatic Mam@@ mak@@ es@@ cin@@ oma study , which were treated in the pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III study once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 abra@@ x@@ ane . &quot;
Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie was the most noticeable important hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ( at 79 % of patients ) and was quick rever@@ sible and dos@@ is@@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ie was reported at 71 % of patients .
An@@ emia ( HB &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed at 46 % of patients with abra@@ sive patients and was severe in three cases ( HB &lt; 8 g / dl ) .

Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is a anti @-@ tim@@ icro@@ bi@@ ble ingredient that promotes the en@@ vi@@ zation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli from the tube @-@ indi@@ ans and stabili@@ ze the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli through in@@ hibition of their des@@ ol@@ y@@ mer@@ ization .
&quot; this stabil@@ isation leads to a in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mi@@ kr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital Inter@@ phase and the mit@@ ment cell functions . &quot;
&quot; it is known that Alb@@ ums is convey@@ ed into the Trans@@ cy@@ c@@ osis of Plas@@ mak@@ om@@ pon@@ ents in the end@@ ot@@ hel@@ m cells , and within the framework of in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have been proven that the presence of Alb@@ ums in the transport of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is promoted by the end@@ ot@@ hel@@ m cells . &quot;
it is assumed that this improved trans@@ end@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ ale transport is convey@@ ed by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ Alb@@ umin@@ rez@@ ept@@ or and due to the alb@@ ot@@ tom@@ an protein SP@@ ARC ( ha@@ un@@ ted protein R@@ ich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) an Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the field of tum@@ or occurs .
the use of abra@@ si@@ ane for metastatic Mam@@ mak@@ ar@@ cin@@ oma is treated with data from 106 patients in two single @-@ part in@@ bl@@ inded studies and of 4@@ 54 patients who were treated in a random@@ ised phase III compar@@ ative study .
&quot; in one study , 43 patients treated with metastatic Mam@@ mak@@ es@@ cin@@ oma with abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an inf@@ usion over 30 minutes by a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
in the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 is used as inf@@ usion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic Mam@@ mak@@ es@@ cin@@ oma .
&quot; this multi@@ cent@@ ric study was carried out in patients with metastatic Mam@@ mak@@ es@@ cin@@ oma , which received every 3 weeks a mon@@ otherapy with Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , either in the form of solvent @-@ quality p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as 30 @-@ minute Inf@@ usion without pre@@ fabri@@ cation ( N = 229 ) . &quot;
&quot; when recording into the study , 64 % of patients had a term general state ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al Met@@ ast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 met@@ ast@@ as@@ est@@ als . &quot;
&quot; 14 % of patients had not received any chemotherapy , 27 % only had a adjuv@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of met@@ ast@@ o@@ asi@@ fication and 19 % due to met@@ ast@@ o@@ asi@@ fication and adjuv@@ ant treatment . &quot;

&quot; it is used in patients with normal blood values , in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion complications may occur if the procedure is not possible in connection with a blood circulation , and if a blood loss is expected from 900 to 1 800 ml . &quot;
treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be led under the supervision of a doctor who owns the experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated .
&quot; in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a self @-@ blood circulation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is to inj@@ amed into a v@@ ene . &quot;
injection can also be carried out by the patient or his assistant person if they have provided an appropriate guide .
&quot; in patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients infected with chemotherapy , the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ aries should always lie in the recommended area ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ it@@ iter with adults or between 9,@@ 5 and 11 g / dl with children ) . &quot;
&quot; the iron values of all patients are in front of the treatment to ensure that no iron angel consists , and iron @-@ complem@@ entary should be administered throughout the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients having received an chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , a an@@ emia may be caused by an er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ dium lack , or therefore the body is not adequ@@ ately addressed to the physical er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used in operations to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a blood loss .
it is produced by a cell into which a gene ( DNA ) was brought to the formation of ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with administration as an injection in a V@@ ene in the framework of a major study involving 479 patients , which caused by ren@@ al problems caused by ren@@ al problems , with the reference mechanism . &quot;
all of the patients participating in this study was at least eight weeks of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o placed in a v@@ ene inj@@ ected before they were either mounted on Ab@@ y@@ amed or to remain E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
main indicators for the effectiveness was the change in hem@@ og@@ glo@@ bin@@ ations between the beginning of the study and the development period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also laid out the results of a study in which the effects of inj@@ ected de@@ fl@@ amed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o were examined in 114 cancer patients who received an chemotherapy .
&quot; in the study involving patients who suffered at one by ren@@ al problems caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ders of patients were provided on de@@ fl@@ amed , in the same dimensions just as with those patients who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; compared to these patients showed that E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o received , an increase of 0,@@ 0@@ 63 g / dl of the output value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common side @-@ effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is a rise in blood pressure , the occasionally to symp@@ tom of a spongiform encephalopath@@ y ( deer problems ) like sudden , st@@ ems mig@@ ra@@ yed he@@ ada@@ che and turbul@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed must not be used in patients , who possibly over@@ hy@@ pers@@ ensi@@ tive ( allergic ) against ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or one of the other components . &quot;
&quot; se@@ di@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems , since further studies are required to ensure that there are no allergic reactions . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Human@@ arz@@ tend ( CH@@ MP ) contributed to the conclusion that for de@@ fl@@ amed according to the provisions of the European Union &apos;s detection , the drug has been a comparable quality , safety and active profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;

controlled clinical studies do not have significant benefits that is attribut@@ able to the gift of ep@@ ox@@ es when the hem@@ og@@ glo@@ bin@@ ical concentration over the importance of controlling the accumulation of symptoms and the prevention of hem@@ ati@@ f@@ usions is increased .
the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ders should amount to approximately 1 g / dl ( 6@@ m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1,25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in hyper@@ tension .
in patients with chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically evi@@ d@@ enter cor@@ on@@ ary heart failure or reser@@ vo@@ irs should not exceed 4.2 recommended upper limit of the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin target concentration .
&quot; following the period of this knowledge , by the treatment of an@@ emia associated with ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with kidney failure , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , the progression of kidney failure are not accelerated . &quot;
in case of tum@@ or patients under chemotherapy should be considered for assessing the therapy of ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ G@@ abe and the er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin @-@ response will be taken into account ( patients who may possibly be trans@@ duc@@ ted ) .

&quot; the decision for applying re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on the risk @-@ risk @-@ degra@@ dation , taking part in the participation of each patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are intended for a greater electrical orthop@@ edic intervention , if possible , before the beginning of the ep@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy the cause of an@@ emia examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; patients who under@@ go a greater electric orthop@@ edic intervention , they should have adequate thy@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis proph@@ yla@@ xis , since they have an increased risk for thro@@ mb@@ otic and v@@ ascular diseases , especially in the underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it cannot be excluded that treatment with ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an output mo@@ ist bin@@ ders of &gt; 13 g / dl an increased risk of post@@ operative thro@@ mb@@ otic / v@@ ascular events can consist . &quot;
in several controlled studies were not proven for ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine that they will improve in tum@@ or patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic an@@ emia that dimin@@ ish the risk or dimin@@ ishing the risk of tum@@ or progression .

the overall survive in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis and related complications in combination with re@@ combin@@ ant human Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin treated patients and controls satisfactory .
&quot; there is an increased risk for thro@@ des@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ic events in tum@@ or pati@@ al , which are treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ ic er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin , and a negative impact on the overall survive can not be excluded . &quot;
&quot; it is not clear how far these results are applied to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin at tum@@ our patients with the goal , transferring a hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ess under 13 g / dl , because too few patients were included with these characteristics in the verified data . &quot;

one 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ G@@ abe and the desired effect should be taken into consideration for the assessment of the effectiveness of Ab@@ y@@ amed .
200 your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood colour ( hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin ) and adjust your de@@ fl@@ amed dose accordingly to keep the risk of a blood cycle ( thro@@ mb@@ al event ) as possible .
&quot; this risk should be weigh@@ ed across from treatment with ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa derived benefits very carefully weigh@@ ed , especially if you have an increased risk for thro@@ mb@@ otic vas@@ cul@@ ary events occur ( e.g. a deep Ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ osis or lung @-@ bo@@ y ) . &quot;
&quot; in case you are cancer patient , consider that ab@@ er@@ amed function as a growth factor for blood cells and under certain circumstances can influence the tum@@ or negative . &quot;
if you imp@@ ose a greater orthop@@ edic surgery should be examined before treatment starts with Ab@@ se@@ amed the cause of your an@@ emia and treated accordingly .
&quot; if your values of the red blood cells ( hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin ) are too high , you should not get se@@ di@@ amed because an increased risk for blood flow after the surgery exists . &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking any other medicines / apply respectively recently taken / used even if it is not a prescription medicine .
&quot; if you take Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in ( means of repression of the immune system ) during your therapy with Ab@@ y@@ amed , your doctor will appropriate certain blood investigations in order to measure the blood levels of Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in . &quot;

A@@ cl@@ asta is used to treat the following diseases : • oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease which makes the bones spr@@ ö@@ de ) both in women after the men@@ op@@ ause and in men .
&quot; it is applied in patients with high frac@@ ture risk ( bon@@ ing out@@ breaks ) , including in patients who suffered a little s@@ trau@@ mati@@ cal hip , like when they fall suffered ; • Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et des Kno@@ b , a disease that changed the normal course of the bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et should take at least 500 mg calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients suffering from hip to a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or@@ ally or by injection in a muscle . &quot;
&quot; the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means against infl@@ amm@@ ation ) just after the use of A@@ cl@@ asta , which can reduce in the three days of inf@@ usion symptoms , such as f@@ ever , muscle aches , gri@@ p@@ pe@@ similar symptoms , joints and he@@ ada@@ che . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , A@@ cl@@ asta may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease . &quot;
&quot; since the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ asta the same is as in zom@@ eta , a part of the data material for Zom@@ eta was attracted to the review of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; at the first study nearly 8 000 older women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and it was examined the number of spine and hips over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; the second study comprising 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , who recently suffered a hip re@@ frac@@ ture ; it became the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years . &quot;
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , A@@ cl@@ asta was tested in two studies in total 357 patients and compared six months with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ at ) . &quot;
&quot; principal indicators of the effic@@ acy was whether the sal@@ ary of al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ ate are in Ser@@ um ( an enzy@@ me , the bone substance ) in the blood again or by at least 75 % compared to the initial value . &quot;
&quot; in the study with older women , the risk of vert@@ eb@@ ops was reduced from patients under A@@ cl@@ asta ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) over a period of three years compared to the patients under plac@@ ebo by 70 % . &quot;
&quot; compared to all patients under A@@ cl@@ asta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) with those under plac@@ ebo , the risk of hips was reduced by 41 % . &quot;
in the study with men and women with gir@@ ak@@ age had 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ asta a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of A@@ cl@@ asta will occur within the first three days of inf@@ usion and are less common in re@@ peti@@ tive inf@@ usions .
A@@ cl@@ asta must not be used in patients who possibly hy@@ pers@@ ensi@@ tive ( allergic ) against Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ ates or one of the other components .
&quot; as with all Bis@@ phosph@@ ates are subject to patients at A@@ cl@@ asta the risk of kidney , reactions to the inf@@ usion of inf@@ usion and O@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( Ab@@ die of Kno@@ chen@@ tissue ) in the ja@@ ws . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ asta provides information material for doctors prepared to apply the A@@ cl@@ asta for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , which contains information such as the medication is applied , as well as similar material for patients where the side @-@ effects of the drug are explained and advised when they should turn to the doctor . &quot;

for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men is recommended by in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous Inf@@ usion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ asta a year .
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip , the administration of the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta two or more weeks after operative care is recommended ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , A@@ cl@@ asta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et . &quot;
after a treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et with A@@ cl@@ asta a long re@@ agents period was observed in patients who have addressed the therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable when patients with Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et provides sufficient supply of calcium to ensure that twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently lear@@ ns low @-@ traum@@ atic hip , a initi@@ al@@ d@@ dose from 5@@ 0,000 to 12@@ 5.000 , i.e. or@@ anges or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first A@@ cl@@ asta inf@@ usion . &quot;

patients with kidney disturb@@ ance ( see Section 4.4 ) In case of patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended as limited clinical experiences for this patient group .
&quot; older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dosage adjustment is not necessary , since the bio@@ availability , distribution and Eli@@ min@@ ation in older patients is similar to the younger . &quot;
&quot; children and adolesc@@ ents A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended for use in children and adolesc@@ ents under 18 years of age , since data on in@@ conceivable and effectiveness are lacking . &quot;
A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) is not recommended for these patient &apos;s population only limited clinical experiences .
an existing Hy@@ po@@ cal@@ z@@ emia is before the beginning of therapy with A@@ cl@@ asta due to sufficient intake of calcium and vitamin D ( see Section 4.3 ) .
&quot; due to the quick inser@@ tion of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on the bone structure can develop a temporary , with@@ held symp@@ tom@@ atic an@@ po@@ cal@@ an@@ emia whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable when patients with Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et provides sufficient supply of calcium to ensure that twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; cancer disease , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor mouth @-@ hygiene , should be treated to an application of bis@@ phosph@@ ates a dental treatment with appropriate pre@@ ame@@ ful dental treatment . &quot;
&quot; for patients who need dental gri@@ ps , there are no data available if the inter@@ ruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ ates reduces the risk to O@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen in the tempor@@ al area . &quot;
clinical evaluation by the treating doctor should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
&quot; the frequency of symptoms which occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ asta , may be reduced by gift of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the use of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of severe inci@@ dents , cases of Pre @-@ hop@@ ed was in patients who received A@@ cl@@ asta , increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received plac@@ ebo ( 0.7 % ) ( 22 from 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) . &quot;
in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , HO@@ RI@@ Z@@ ON - Recur@@ ve Fr@@ ac@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) was the overall pre@@ valence of atri@@ cal between A@@ cl@@ asta ( 2.7 % ) and plac@@ ebo ( 2.3 % ) .

ren@@ al infections of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was associated with kidney function ( i.e. an increase of the kidney function ( i.e. an increase in the Ser@@ um @-@ Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as a ren@@ al kidney failure .
the change in the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( yearly before the administration ) and the appearance of kidney failure and a restricted ren@@ al function were in a clinical trial in oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years comparable between the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase in the ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of gift was observed in 1.8 % of patients with A@@ cl@@ asta patients compared with 0.7 % of the patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; based on evaluating the laboratory @-@ based calcium values , the temporary as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values indicated below the normal oscill@@ ation en@@ rich ( less than scrat@@ m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , with 2,@@ 3 % of the patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta in the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et studies treated patients . &quot;
&quot; all patients received adequate amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study on post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study for avoiding clinical frac@@ tures after a gir@@ ak@@ age and into the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et studies ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study for avoiding clinical frac@@ tures after a recent gir@@ ak@@ age , the vitamin D mirror were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , but the majority of patients received an initiation of vitamin D before the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions After the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical trial has been reported on local reactions to inf@@ usion , such as red@@ ness , sw@@ elling and / or pain , reports ( 0.7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; O@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses in the tempor@@ al area of occasionally , especially in cancer patients , about O@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen ( primary in the tempor@@ al area ) reports the with Bis@@ phosph@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid . &quot;
many of these patients had signs of local infections including O@@ ste@@ om@@ yel@@ i@@ tis and most of the reports refers to cancer patients according to tooth extraction or other dental tools .

A@@ cl@@ asta patients treated patients aged 75 and over had a 60 % reduced risk for vert@@ eb@@ ri@@ ans compared to plac@@ ebo patients ( p &lt; 0.@@ 0001 ) .
&quot; effects on Hip frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ asta proved a constant effect on three years , which resulted in a maximum of 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk for hips . &quot;
&quot; effect on the bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ asta increased the bone density on the Len@@ den@@ vert@@ eb@@ ur@@ ic acid , hat@@ s and on dist@@ al radius compared to the plac@@ ebo treatment significantly at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;

B @-@ CT@@ X was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
&quot; the vitamin D mirror were not tested in routine , but the majority of patients received a beginnings of vitamin D ( 5@@ 0,000 to 12@@ 5.000 , oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular ) 2 weeks before inf@@ usion . &quot;
the overall mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group of A@@ cl@@ asta treated group , compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the plac@@ ebo group . &quot;

the A@@ cl@@ asta treatment led over 24 months in comparison to plac@@ ebo treatment to an increase in the BM@@ D around 5.5 % in the total power and by 4.4 % at the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ as .
clinical effectiveness in men In the HO@@ RI@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study were random@@ ized 5@@ 08 men random@@ ized and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months .
&quot; the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the frequency of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in A@@ cl@@ asta @-@ treated men compared to 8,@@ 7 % in plac@@ ebo . &quot;

11 The effectiveness of an inf@@ usion of 5 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in comparison with the intake of 30 mg of Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at once daily during 2 months was proven in two hex@@ ag@@ onal studies .
&quot; in the combined results , after 6 months a similar decrease in the pain of pain and pain @-@ controlled compared to the initial value for A@@ cl@@ asta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at was observed . &quot;
patients who were classified as Respon@@ ses at the end of the sixth study ( on therapy addressed ) were entered into a follow @-@ up phase .

&quot; unique and multi @-@ fold 5 and 15 minutes continuous inf@@ usions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid at 64 patients took the following pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tic data that proved to be dos@@ ed independently . &quot;
&quot; after that , the Plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ egel took rapidly from &lt; 10 % of the maximum value to 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long lasting phase very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value . &quot;

&quot; Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a representative of a sub@@ woofer class that is called Bis@@ phosph@@ orous , and is used to treat the oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , the oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et of Kno@@ ck . &quot;
&quot; removable blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ rogen , which are formed from and@@ rogen , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass , which is observed in men . &quot;
&quot; at the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , the bone structure is constructed too fast , and new bone material is un@@ arranged , which weak@@ en the bone material weaker than normal . &quot;
A@@ cl@@ asta works by norm@@ alizes the bone structure with a normal bone formation and thus gives the bone again strength .
&quot; if you have to under@@ go in dental treatment or have to under@@ go a dental surgery , inform your doctor that you will be treated with A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;

a summary of the EP@@ AR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Ap@@ pear@@ ance Report ( EP@@ AR ) which has been analysed how the Committee for Human@@ arz@@ tend ( CH@@ MP ) has been judged to make recommendations concerning the use of the drug .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type @-@ 2 @-@ diabetes ( also known as not ins@@ ulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be applied alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) where Met@@ form@@ in ( ein di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ medi@@ otherapy ) are not displayed together with another di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ medi@@ otherapy ( dual therapy ) .
&quot; it can be applied in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , which cannot be satisfactory with met@@ form@@ ally alone in the highest dosage dose . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ye or ins@@ ulin , the previous dosage of the sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ans or ins@@ ulin can be kept in patients with Hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( minimum blood sugar ) ; here the dose of the sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ans or ins@@ ulin would be reduced . &quot;
&quot; this means that the physical ins@@ ulin can be better toler@@ ated and decl@@ ining the blood sugar , which makes type @-@ 2 @-@ diabetes better . &quot;
&quot; with more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of Ac@@ tos in Tri@@ ple@@ therapy were examined ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ p , in addition they received up to 3.5 years either accounts or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ ly hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bal , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) measured , which shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
&quot; accounts led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which suggests that the blood sugars are reduced in use of doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ a@@ therapy study , the effect of an additional gift from Ac@@ tos to existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ p in a reduction of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.94 % , while the additional gift of plac@@ ebo led to a reduction of 0.7 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study , in which the combination of accounts and ins@@ ulin was examined in 289 patients , patients , the accounts in addition to ins@@ ulin , compared with 0.7 % after 6 months compared to 0.7 % compared to patients who took in addition plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects related to Ac@@ tos were visual dis@@ rup@@ tions , infections of the upper air@@ ways ( heating ) , weight gain and hy@@ po@@ esth@@ esia ( decreased sensitivity to stim@@ uli ) . &quot;
&quot; accounts may not be used in patients , who might be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) compared to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , still in patients with liver problems , heart failure or di@@ abe@@ tic K@@ eto@@ azi@@ ce ( high ket@@ ones - aci@@ d@@ spar - in the blood ) . &quot;
&quot; it has been decided that acet@@ one should serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients , where met@@ form@@ in is not shown . &quot;
October 2000 presented the European Commission to the Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited A permit for inclusion of accounts in the entire European Union .
&quot; tablets are white to white , round , v@@ ault and wear on one side the mark@@ ings &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other hand the in@@ scription &quot; AC@@ TOS . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is also shown for the combination of ins@@ ulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar has been inadequate with ins@@ ulin and where met@@ form@@ ations is in@@ appropriate , due to con@@ train@@ dic@@ ations or intoler@@ ance is in@@ appropriate ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; for use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , therefore the application is not recommended in this age group . &quot;
&quot; in patients infected with the presence at least one risk factor ( e.g. past her@@ al@@ ges@@ tion or symp@@ tom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should begin treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of a heart failure , weight gain or oils , especially those with reduced car@@ dinal reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of a heart failure , weight gain and oils , when pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is applied in combination with ins@@ ulin . &quot;
a cardiovascular Out@@ come study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mak@@ rov@@ as@@ cul@@ ary disease was performed .
&quot; in this study , an increase in reports of heart failure , which did not lead to an increase in mort@@ ality in the study . &quot;
&quot; in patients with increased risk minim@@ ization ( ALT &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of the standard area ) or with other signs of liver disease may not be used for pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on . &quot;
&quot; when the ALT @-@ mirror up to the 3 @-@ fold of the upper limit of the standard area are increased , the liver pol@@ ymers are as soon as possible to control . &quot;
&quot; if a patient is developed to point on a hep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , secret , appeti@@ te , fatigue , appeti@@ te and / or dar@@ ker Har@@ n , are the liver enzy@@ mes . &quot;
&quot; the decision , whether the treatment of patients with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on will continue , should be directed until the occurrence of the laboratory parameters of the clinical assessment . &quot;
clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has been proven to be dos@@ ed @-@ dependent weight that can be lo@@ wer@@ ed from obesity and in some cases associated with a hydr@@ ation .
as a result of a her@@ modi@@ al in therapy with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on a small reduction in the middle hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ders ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and the hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.4 % ) .
similar changes have been observed in compar@@ ative controlled studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under Met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ ging by 3 @-@ 4 % ) and a lower scale also in patients under Sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ nitrogen and ins@@ ulin ( relative reduction of hem@@ ost@@ al by 1 @-@ 2 % ) and the hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased ins@@ ulin sensitivity , in patients , the pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on as oral or triple @-@ combination therapy with a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff or as a dual @-@ combination therapy with ins@@ ulin , the risk of dos@@ ing @-@ dependent Hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; following the market launch was reported under the treatment with thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ons , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , on a appearance or a deterioration of di@@ abe@@ tic bro@@ ul@@ ence with a reduction in visual ac@@ u@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; it is un@@ clear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and the appearance of mac@@ ul@@ arities , but susp@@ ected doctors should report about disturb@@ ances about disturb@@ ances of visual ac@@ u@@ ity ; a suitable oph@@ thal@@ mic effect should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of reports of unwanted events regarding bone br@@ aces from random@@ ised , controlled , double fl@@ ashes clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients were treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one . &quot;
the re@@ mun@@ eration frac@@ ture amoun@@ ted to 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years with the pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated women and 1.@@ 1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years with women who were treated with compar@@ ative medicine .
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a study conducted over 3.5 years to investigation of cardiovascular events , compared with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated patients with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0,5 frac@@ tures per 100 patients were treated with patients . &quot;
&quot; patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or this one enters , the treatment is cancelled ( see Section 4.6 ) . &quot;
&quot; studies on the analysis of interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on the pharmaceutical companies or pharmaceutical dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; interactions with drugs , which are metabo@@ li@@ zed by these enzy@@ mes , e.g. or@@ ale contrast , calcium @-@ can@@ al@@ blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduction are not to be expected . &quot;
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with gem@@ fi@@ bro@@ zil ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in order of the 3 @-@ fold .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C8 @-@ in@@ duc@@ tor ) resulted in a lowering of the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
&quot; this is attributed to that under treatment of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , dimin@@ ished in the pregnancy , and increased ins@@ ulin resistance of the mother &apos;s animal and thereby reduces the availability of met@@ ab@@ lic substr@@ ates for the fet@@ al growth . &quot;
&quot; very often &gt; 1 / 10 ; common &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , case : Unknown ( from present data is not estimated ) . &quot;
&quot; these lead to a temporary change in the turn , and the conn@@ ective tissues of the lens , as they also be observed with other hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic agents . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , ALT @-@ asc@@ ents took place over the tri@@ ples of the upper limit of the norm@@ alities as well as on plac@@ ebo , yet rar@@ er than in comparison groups among met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ s@@ stoff . &quot;
in a out@@ come study in patients with an existing advanced mak@@ rov@@ as@@ cul@@ ary disease was the frequency of severe her@@ cin@@ eration efficiency by 1.6 % higher than under plac@@ ebo when pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on b@@ z@@ w .
&quot; since the launch of the launch , rare over her@@ al@@ suff@@ iciency is reported more frequently if pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was used in combination with ins@@ ulin or in patients with heart failure in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; it became a summary analysis of reports of unwanted events regarding bone bree@@ zes , controlled , double fl@@ ashes , clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated groups and over 7,@@ 400 patients in patients with compar@@ ative medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the over a period of 3.5 years of ongoing pro@@ active study , frac@@ tures presented at 44 / 870 ( 5.2 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients who were treated with compar@@ ative medicine . &quot;
&quot; in taking the maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days occurred no symptoms . &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on seems to have an activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator Activ@@ ated Rec@@ ept@@ or @-@ g ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ g ) ) which leads to an increased ins@@ ulin sensitivity of liver and sk@@ elet@@ on muscle cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduces the Glu@@ cos@@ e@@ production in the liver and the periph@@ eral gl@@ cos@@ ity recycling in case of ins@@ ulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d as mon@@ otherapy has been continued over two years to investigate the period until termination of the therapeutic effects ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &gt; 8,@@ 0 % after the first 6 treatments available ) .
&quot; at the time after two years after the beginning of therapy , a blood sugar has been defined ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8,@@ 0 % ) by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on at 69 % of patients treated ( compared to 50 % of patients under Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ eb@@ ok@@ on@@ controlled study over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was random@@ ly adjusted in spite of three im@@ on@@ ous Optim@@ ization phase with ins@@ ulin inadequate , to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduced the middle H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c - value by 0,45 % , compared to the patients who continue to ins@@ ulin ; a reduction of ins@@ ulin delivery in which with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated group was observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies over one year , under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on con@@ den@@ sing a statisti@@ cally significant dism@@ is@@ cation of the album in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Qu@@ ot@@ ien@@ cies compared to the output values . &quot;
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was checked in a small group on 18 weeks of the examination of type @-@ 2 di@@ abe@@ tics .
&quot; in most clinical studies were observed in comparison to plac@@ ebo a reduction of the overall plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids , and a rise of HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as slightly , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ D@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials over a period of up to two years reduced Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , compared to plac@@ ebo , met@@ form@@ in or Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d the total plas@@ mas@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol levels . &quot;
&quot; compared to plac@@ ebo , under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on no statisti@@ cally significant increase in the L@@ DL cholesterol levels were observed during Met@@ form@@ in and Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d dimin@@ ished values . &quot;
&quot; in a study on 20 weeks reduced Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , not only the so@@ ber tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as the hep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a kar@@ di@@ ov@@ as@@ cul@@ ary Out@@ come study , 5@@ 238 patients were random@@ ized with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mak@@ rov@@ as@@ cul@@ osis therapy in groups of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing anti@@ di@@ abe@@ tic therapy either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; after oral application , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is quickly res@@ or@@ ated , with peak con@@ cent@@ ric pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on normally reaches 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; based on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV applied to the effectiveness in approximately triple the effectiveness of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , while the relative effic@@ acy of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; Inter@@ action studies could be proven that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on the pharmaceutical companies or pharmaceutical dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Gem@@ fi@@ bro@@ zil ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C8 / in@@ duc@@ tor ) or lowers the plasma concentration of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( see Section 4.5 ) .
according to oral application of radio@@ active mark@@ tes pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in humans the mark@@ er was found mainly in the f@@ ences ( 55 % ) and to a lower extent in the har@@ n ( 45 % ) .
the middle plasma @-@ Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al period from un@@ changing pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one amounts to the humans 5 @-@ 6 hours and all of the entire active metabolism is between 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma concentr@@ ations of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and its met@@ abo@@ lic are lower than in patients with reduced kidney function than with healthy volunteers , whereby the rates of the oral clear@@ ing of the native substance resem@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; in tox@@ ic@@ ological studies occurred in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys coinci@@ ded after repeated administration of Plas@@ ma@@ stered administration , an@@ emia and rever@@ sible ec@@ cent@@ ric heart hyper@@ trop@@ hies . &quot;
this is attributed to that under treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on which is dimin@@ ished in the gesture of hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ emia and increased ins@@ ulin resistance from the mat@@ ernity and thereby reduces the availability of met@@ ab@@ lic substr@@ ates for the fet@@ al growth .
in long term studies ( up to 2 years ) were in@@ duced by the rat of increased incidence of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( for male and female rats ) and tum@@ ors ( with male rats ) of the ur@@ ges epi@@ th@@ el@@ ium .

&quot; in another study on two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ on were examined with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies over one year , under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on con@@ den@@ sing a statisti@@ cally significant dism@@ is@@ cation of the album in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Qu@@ ot@@ ien@@ cies compared to the output values . &quot;

&quot; Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ an was produced in a total of 294 patients with type 1 @-@ diabetes , in which the pan@@ cre@@ as does not produce ins@@ ulin , and type @-@ 2 @-@ diabetes , where the body is unable to use the ins@@ ulin effectively . &quot;
in the study after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ ent hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin ) measured ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) which shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ an led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mir@@ rors that pointed out that the blood sugar levels were similarly strong as with another human @-@ ins@@ ulin .
Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ an@@ ane should not be used in patients who possibly hy@@ pers@@ ensi@@ tive ( allergic ) to human ins@@ ulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components react .
&quot; in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ an may be adjusted when it is administered together with a number of other medicines which can affect the blood sugar ( the full list is the package Document ) . &quot;
the Committee for Human@@ arz@@ tend ( CH@@ MP ) contributed to the conclusion that the benefits of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ an increase in the treatment of diabetes against the risks .
October 2002 presented the European Commission to the Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S written approval for In@@ tr@@ aph@@ an in the entire European Union .
&quot; advanced ins@@ ulin products are usually used once or twice daily , if a fast initi@@ ale effect will be desired along with a longer lasting effect . &quot;

patients whose blood sugar has significantly improved for example by a intensified ins@@ ulin therapy for example , the an@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia is changing symptoms and should be advised accordingly .
&quot; any change in terms of strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , ins@@ ulin type ( fast work , biological ins@@ ulin , long @-@ ins@@ ulin , ins@@ ulin or ins@@ ulin DNS compared to ins@@ ulin resistance ) can cause a change in dosage . &quot;
&quot; if the change to Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ an is required for the patient a dosage adjustment , this can be necessary for the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after conversion . &quot;
&quot; some patients , in which hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions came after a change of animal temper@@ ate ins@@ ulin , reported that the early War@@ n@@ symp@@ tom symptoms were less pronounced or different than with their previous ins@@ ulin . &quot;
&quot; travelling that over several times , the patient should be pointed to the Council of his doctor , as such trips may lead to that ins@@ ulin and meals must be applied or taken . &quot;
the doctor must therefore take into account possible interactions in the therapy and may ask for his patients according to others by them .

&quot; in case of the ur@@ f@@ ting level in two to four weeks , it is still up to 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ it@@ res , the dose can be increased once daily 120 mg once daily . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment months , more and more periods of treatment can occur ; therefore , the patient is recommended for at least during the first six months under treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic yet another medicine for prevention of g@@ inal inci@@ dents . &quot;
&quot; the drug is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ@@ tran@@ splan@@ tion , since these groups was not examined . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , at the 1 0@@ 72 patients , the effectiveness of three aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) with the one plac@@ ebo ( proj@@ medi@@ kam@@ ents ) and from Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( a different drug for treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ik@@ emia ) . &quot;
the second study were compared two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) one year compared to 762 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of once a day 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
&quot; principal indicators of the effic@@ acy was the number of patients , their ur@@ inary level in the blood during the last three measurements under 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients who attended Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of patients who participated once daily 120 mg in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , this was in 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in none of the 134 patients under plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed during 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are he@@ ada@@ che , diar@@ rhe@@ a , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nau@@ sea , rash and normal liver values . &quot;
&quot; in particular in patients with cardi@@ ac diseases , there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Human@@ arz@@ tend ( CH@@ MP ) contributed to the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ inary tract in the blood , but also a higher risk of side effects associated with the heart and blood vessels . &quot;

clinical study results The effectiveness of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C was described in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and fact study as below ) which were performed with 1.8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ik@@ emia and tox@@ ins .
the primary effic@@ acy point was in each study of the proportion of patients in which the last three month of specific Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ ering level &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) were .
plac@@ ebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 269 ) or Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 134 ) for patients with a ser@@ um@@ ination in@@ scription at the beginning of the course of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.@@ 0 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX study showed significant both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventional cans of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the fact @-@ study showed significant both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to treatment with the usual dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

lowering of the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ ness of &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the arz@@ t@@ uch in week 2 and kept permanently over the entire treatment .
509 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with Ser@@ um@@ cre@@ at@@ in@@ rated &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily . &quot;
primary End@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney @-@ functional The AP@@ EX study evaluated the effectiveness of 40 patients with kidney function .
with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C the primary objective point at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) .
there was no clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to the percentage of the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ mac@@ ros with Pro@@ b@@ anden regardless of their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in group with normal kidney function and 55 % in group with severe kidney function ) .
primary End@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ s@@ no@@ concentration ≥ 10 mg / dl About 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and fact study ) had a Ser@@ um@@ har@@ vesting concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
the data collected in two years of open extension phase the phase 3 showed that the permanent lowering of the incidence of g@@ inal injury was revealed in &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) a decrease in the incidence of g@@ inal injury that is less than 3 % of the patients needed in the months 16 @-@ 24 treatment ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients needed no treatment against a g@@ ich@@ ub ) .
&quot; this was associated with a reduction in the cabinet size , which had a complete dis@@ appearance of the gas@@ ket up to month 24 as a result of 54 % of patients . &quot;
increased T@@ SH@@ - Values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ s / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.@@ 0 % ) and also in patients who received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.5 % ) in the open long @-@ time renewal studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .
with healthy proo@@ fre@@ ets increased the maximum plasma concentr@@ ations ( C@@ max ) and the area under the plasma @-@ cent@@ ric time @-@ curve ( AU@@ C ) from Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at after administration easier and multi@@ pl@@ ers of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional .

&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE will be used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( one disease , in which the bones are cre@@ ak@@ y ) in women after men@@ op@@ ause , with which a risk for a low vitamin D mirror exists . &quot;
&quot; patient needs to take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including Ant@@ azi@@ da , calcium and vitamin C ) . &quot;
&quot; to avoid a irrit@@ ation of the es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient may take up until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D@@ 3 already separated from each other in pharmaceuticals , which are approved in the European Union , the company laid data from previous studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also led a study with 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis to identify the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in relation to increasing the vitamin D of mir@@ rors .
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment the proportion of patients with low vitamin D mirror in patients were treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , low ( 11 % ) than those who participated exclusively Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the company also put data before that , present in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , al@@ end@@ ron@@ at dose exactly the dose which is required for preventing a bone loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed during 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are he@@ ada@@ ches , pain of the muscul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal body , diar@@ rhe@@ a ( diges@@ tive dis@@ rup@@ tions ) , si@@ diar@@ rhe@@ a ( diges@@ tive dis@@ rup@@ tions ) , si@@ diar@@ rhe@@ a ( bl@@ anks ) , si@@ diar@@ rhe@@ a ( sli@@ pping ) , fl@@ acci@@ dentally ab@@ dom@@ en ( brus@@ hed belly ) as well as suction cups . &quot;
&quot; in patients with any hy@@ pers@@ ensi@@ tivity , vitamin D@@ 3 or one of the other components may not be applied AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE . &quot;
&quot; it may not be applied in diseases of the es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with Hy@@ po@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( lower calcium levels ) or in patients who can not stand at least 30 minutes . &quot;
&quot; Janu@@ ary@@ 2007 , the European Commission concluded the company Mer@@ ck Sharp &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd . a permit for the transfer of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; capsule @-@ shaped , white to broken white tablets , marked with the envel@@ ope of a bone on one side and &quot; &quot; 710 &quot; on the other side . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first food , drink or dispos@@ ing of pharmaceuticals ( including Ant@@ azi@@ da , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day . &quot;
the following hints are precisely to follow to reduce the risk to all@@ oph@@ age@@ al irrit@@ ation and related side effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed after the advent of the day just with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patients should not stop the tablet in the mouth . • The patients should not take place prior to the first food intake of the day which should take place 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
&quot; B. pep@@ tic Ul@@ kus , active gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal ble@@ eding or surgical interventions in the upper gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal tract , except P@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y , only under special caution ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; Ö@@ soph@@ age@@ ale reactions , such as Ö@@ soph@@ agi@@ tis , ös@@ oph@@ age@@ al ar@@ zer@@ a and ös@@ oph@@ age@@ al ero@@ sion , rarely reported by ös@@ oph@@ age@@ al St@@ ric@@ tures , were reported in patients under the intake of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( partly were these severe and required a hospital assignment ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor should therefore examine attentive to all signs and symptoms , which should be pointed to potential offensive reactions such as dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ie , pain in swal@@ low or retro@@ ster@@ n@@ asty sor@@ row or new or himself w@@ lim@@ mer@@ ging of so@@ d@@ burn the medicine and get medical advice ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 The risk of severe th@@ oph@@ age@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take properly , and / or after the appearance of symptoms which refer to an ös@@ oph@@ age@@ al irrit@@ ation . &quot;
it is very important that all dos@@ ing instructions will be passed on to the patients and be understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .
&quot; while in large out clinical studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ age no increased risk was determined , rarely ( according to market introduction ) Mag@@ - and Du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ zer@@ a , including some heavy and with complications , reports ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; O@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose of the p@@ ile , commonly related to a dental extraction and / or a local infection ( including O@@ ste@@ om@@ yel@@ i@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose treatment ime predomin@@ antly in@@ trav@@ en@@ ously administered Bis@@ phosph@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; there are no data available to indicate whether the ab@@ uses of a Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ at@@ therapy in patients who need a coll@@ ar surgical procedure , dimin@@ ished the risk of an O@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ ass by the p@@ ile . &quot;
the clinical evaluation by the treating doctor is binding for the treatment planning for each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be reli@@ ed that they should take the tablet next morning after the om@@ iting of a dose AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE before they noticed their failure .
&quot; you should not take two tablets on the same day , but take the intake of one tablet per week as originally planned for the week@@ day day . &quot;
&quot; other disorders that affect the mineral change ( such as vitamin D @-@ lack and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ edi@@ sm ) , should be treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE before the beginning of the therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at foods and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acid as and some oral medicine may imp@@ air the Res@@ or@@ ption of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at when they are taken at the same time . &quot;
&quot; therefore , patients need to wait after taking Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at least 30 minutes before they take other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific Inter@@ action studies have not been carried out , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ age was taken together with a variety of usually prescribed medicines without that clin@@ ically relevant interactions occurred . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for the use of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not intended to apply either during pregnancy or imp@@ ending women .
&quot; animal studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ age leave no reference to direct ou@@ trag@@ eous effects in terms of pregnancy , the embryonic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development . &quot;
&quot; O@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose of the j@@ aw was reported in patients under Bis@@ phosph@@ ates ; most of the reports have been reported by cancer patients , but also in case of oste@@ opor@@ osis . &quot;
nevertheless the Ser@@ um @-@ Cal@@ cium at &lt; 8.@@ 0 mg / dl ( 2.8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the Ser@@ um@@ - phosph@@ ate to ≤ 2 0 mg / dl ( 0.9 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency .
&quot; Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at as a result of a oral over@@ dose , hy@@ po@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , mort@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia and side effects in the upper gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal tract such as stomach vers@@ y , so@@ d@@ burn , Ö@@ soph@@ agi@@ tis , gast@@ ri@@ tis or Ul@@ zer@@ a occur . &quot;

the effects of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at on bone mass and frac@@ turing women were examined in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) and in the frac@@ ture Inter@@ ven@@ ing study ( F@@ IT : N = 6.@@ 459 ) .

in the two @-@ year extension of these studies kept the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D of vert@@ eb@@ ral column and tro@@ ch@@ anter further ; also the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur@@ ist and the entire body was maintained .
fit consisted of two pl@@ az@@ eb@@ ok@@ on@@ controlled studies where Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at daily ( 5 mg daily over 2 years and then 10 mg daily continued either via 1 or 2 years ) :
&quot; in this study reduced the daily gift of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at the appearance of at least a new sp@@ inal cord by 47 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 7,@@ 9 % compared to plac@@ ebo 15,@@ 0 % ) . &quot;

&quot; in oste@@ opor@@ osis , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first food or drinking of the day . &quot;
&quot; in healthy eating , the gift of oral Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily over five days ) no clin@@ ically significant change in the oral bio@@ availability of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) . &quot;

&quot; Adv@@ ag@@ raf is administered adult patients , those who plan a kid@@ neys or liver tran@@ splan@@ ts to prevent a rep@@ ul@@ sion of the tran@@ splan@@ ts by the immune system . &quot;
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gr@@ aft are already deploy@@ ed in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously performed studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gr@@ aft and data published in the published literature . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the results of a clinical study were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with ren@@ al transpl@@ antation , whereby the application of Adv@@ ag@@ raf is compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gr@@ aft or Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; principal indic@@ ator of the effectiveness was the number of patients where the transpl@@ ant@@ age was dischar@@ ged after a treatment duration of one year ( by example , how often a renewed organ@@ tran@@ splan@@ tion or a resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , further studies of 119 patients were conducted with ren@@ al transpl@@ antation and 129 patients with liver transpl@@ ant and examined as Adv@@ ag@@ raf in comparison to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gr@@ ank from the body . &quot;

&quot; in patients with any hy@@ pers@@ ensi@@ tivity ( allergy ) against Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ id antibiotics ( such as er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or one of the other components may not be applied . &quot;
patients and doctors must be careful when others ( especially some herbal ) medicines will be taken simultaneously with Adv@@ ag@@ raf since the Adv@@ ag@@ raf @-@ dose or the dose of the same medication may be adjusted accordingly .

&quot; only doctors , who are familiar with the immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transpl@@ ant patients should do this drug or make changes in the immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m , this can lead to tran@@ splan@@ ts or to an increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or over@@ od@@ ly supp@@ ression . &quot;
patients should always keep the same Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; conver@@ sions of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under the eng@@ aging control of one in the transpl@@ ant medical physician ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; in a result of conversion to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and corresponding dosage adjustment must be carried out to ensure that the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m remains . &quot;
the dosage of Adv@@ ag@@ raf should be primarily based on the clinical assessment of cont@@ ention and compatibility in the individual case and on blood levels ( see below )
&quot; after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f on Adv@@ ag@@ raf , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m @-@ Tal@@ ar should be controlled before the conversion and over two weeks after conversion . &quot;
&quot; Day 4 was the system@@ ic exposure , measured as a valley level , with both formulations both in kidney and living @-@ tran@@ splan@@ ts . &quot;
careful and re@@ peti@@ tive controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m talents are recommended during the first two weeks after transpl@@ ant under Adv@@ ag@@ raf to ensure adequate substance @-@ exposure to the immediate post@@ ure phase .
since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m is a substance with low clear@@ ance can take an adaptation of the Adv@@ ag@@ raf @-@ Dos@@ is@@ schem@@ as several days until the Ste@@ ady State is achieved .
in case the condition of the patient in the first post@@ operative phase does not allow any oral intake of drugs may be in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml con@@ cent@@ arte for the production of an inf@@ usion solution ) with a dose of ca .
&quot; the duration of the application to supp@@ ression of tran@@ splan@@ ts must be maintained the immune supp@@ ression ; therefore , therefore , therefore , can not be specified for a maximum duration of the oral therapy . &quot;
dos@@ ing Recommen@@ dations - kidney transpl@@ antation of the tran@@ splan@@ ts The or@@ ale Adv@@ ag@@ raf @-@ therapy should start with 0.20 - promised mg / kg / day as a once daily gift in the morning .
further dosage adjustment can be necessary later since the pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m can change in the course of stabil@@ isation of the patient after the transpl@@ antation .
dos@@ ing Recommen@@ dations - liver transpl@@ ant proph@@ yla@@ xis of the transpl@@ ant therapy was supposed to start with 0.10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
&quot; dos@@ ing Recommen@@ dations - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ raf must be a tran@@ splan@@ ts of pro@@ gra@@ f capsules at a once daily intake of Adv@@ ag@@ raf , so this conversion in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the entire daily dose . &quot;
kidney and liver transpl@@ ant after a change@@ over from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants on Adv@@ ag@@ raf once daily needs the treatment with each in ren@@ al and liver transpl@@ ant recommended oral initi@@ als for the proph@@ yla@@ xis of the transpl@@ antation .
&quot; heart transpl@@ ant At adult patients who will be converted to Adv@@ ag@@ raf is a oral initi@@ ate dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day daily once in the morning . &quot;
&quot; other tran@@ splan@@ ts expressed no clinical experience with Adv@@ ag@@ raf in pul@@ mon@@ ary , pan@@ cre@@ - and dar@@ tran@@ splan@@ ts patients in a oral initi@@ ating op@@ osis of 0,@@ 2 mg / kg / day and at intest@@ inal initi@@ ators of 0.7 mg / kg / day . &quot;
dosage adjustment in special patients @-@ groups patients with reduced liver function to maintain blood flow in the related area can be required in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions of a dose of dose .
patients with reduced kidney function Da the kidney function has no influence on the pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be assumed that a dosage adjustment is not required .
&quot; due to the ne@@ y@@ oto@@ x@@ ic Pot@@ enti@@ as of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m , however , a careful monitoring of ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of the ser@@ um@@ ination levels , is recommended for calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ incl@@ ance and supervision of the fur @-@ volume ) . &quot;
change@@ over from Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ ag@@ raf When the conversion from a Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in@@ - to a Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m @-@ based therapy is advisable ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on the talents in full @-@ fl@@ ut The dose should be primarily based on the clinical assessment of cont@@ ention and compatibility in the individual case under the aid of full @-@ sy@@ ru@@ ut Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m @-@ talents controls .
&quot; it is recommended for frequent controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m talent , during the first two weeks after transpl@@ antation , followed by periodi@@ c checks during treatment therapy . &quot;
&quot; blood @-@ talents of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m should also change after change@@ over from Pro@@ gra@@ f on Adv@@ ag@@ raf , Dos@@ is@@ adap@@ tion , changes of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or during simultaneous application of substances which could alter the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ full ble@@ centr@@ ation ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since Adv@@ ag@@ raf is a medicine with a low clear@@ ance , adjustments the dose may need several days until the Ste@@ ady State is entered . &quot;
&quot; the data in clinical studies will conclude that a successful treatment is possible in most cases , when the scroll in the blood 20 n@@ g / ml will not exceed . &quot;
in clinical practice the talents of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus generally lie in full bl@@ age in the first time after liver transpl@@ ant generally in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and with - and warm @-@ made patients with 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
&quot; during the subsequent examination therapy of Leb@@ anese , kidney and heart transpl@@ ant were generally used in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; this has led to serious unwanted events , including tran@@ splan@@ ts or other side effects which can occur in a result of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m Under@@ - or over@@ exposure . &quot;
patients should always keep the same Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; conver@@ sions of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under the eng@@ aging control of one in the transpl@@ ant medical physician ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; 5 For treatment of adult patients with tran@@ splan@@ ts , which proved to be compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants as therapy , there is no clinical data for the ret@@ arded formulation Adv@@ ag@@ raf . &quot;
for proph@@ yla@@ xis of tran@@ splan@@ ts at adult heart transpl@@ ant and tran@@ splan@@ ts at Kind@@ es@@ alter are still no clinical data for the ret@@ arded formulation Adv@@ ag@@ raf .
&quot; due to possible interactions that can lead to a reduction of the tac@@ tical levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m , the intake of herbal supplements ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) contain , or other plant reproductive medicine during a treatment with Adv@@ ag@@ raf ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with Di@@ ar@@ rh@@ ö is a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - concentr@@ ations in the blood , since the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m blood levels can be subject to significant fluctu@@ ations under such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f had seen as a cardi@@ omy@@ opath@@ y Kam@@ mer@@ ie or sept@@ um hyper@@ trop@@ hia , which can therefore also happen under Adv@@ ag@@ raf . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders , are an already existing heart suffering , a treatment of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver dys@@ functions , infections , fluid . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , the exposure of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to possible risks of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin l@@ esi@@ ons by suitable clothes or using a solar battery using a high level factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients who take Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m , symptoms for P@@ RES like he@@ ada@@ che , altered consciousness levels , cr@@ amps and se@@ ers should show a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g . &quot;

simultaneous application of medicines or herbal medicinal products known as Hem@@ mer or in@@ duc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect or reduce the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m or reduce the blood values of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m .
&quot; it is therefore recommended to change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - blood levels with simultaneous gift of substances , which can change the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and to set the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m dosage ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;
a strongly pronounced interaction was performed with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ic as K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol , Flu@@ con@@ az@@ ol , I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ol and the icon@@ ic @-@ antibiotic er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV @-@ Prot@@ e@@ as@@ former numbers ( z ) .
&quot; pharmac@@ ogen@@ ok@@ ine@@ studies studies , that the increase in blood levels mainly consists of increased bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m , caused by the in@@ hibition of the gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal contam@@ ination . &quot;
high @-@ do@@ z@@ ated Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on is used as it can increase or reduce concentration of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m in the blood .
the effect of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ Hem@@ mer ; therefore the simultaneous application of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m with drugs known by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 metabo@@ li@@ zed .
since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m desc@@ end the clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contr@@ az@@ tiv@@ a and thus can increase hormones in making decisions about recep@@ tive measures is particularly careful .
the results of animal are shown that Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m will potentially reduce the clear@@ ance of Pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ on and extend their half @-@ time .
&quot; the results of a small number of investigations on transpl@@ ant patients provide no indication that under Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m , compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , an increased risk of unwanted events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; in uter@@ o Ex@@ position , a surveillance of new@@ bor@@ ns is recommended on possible effects of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m ( in particular with regard to its effect on the kid@@ neys ) . &quot;

Adv@@ ate is used to treat and prevention of blood vessels in patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( one by the lack of factor VIII related , cultivated blood @-@ related disorder ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application are focuss@@ ed whether Adv@@ ate is applied to the treatment of hem@@ or@@ ations or prevention of hem@@ or@@ ations in surgical procedure .
patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A suffer from a factor VIII lack of blood issues such as ble@@ eding issues such as ble@@ eding in joints , muscles or internal organs . &quot;
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extr@@ acted from human plasma but according to a method designed as &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; :
&quot; it is produced by a cell that was produced by a cell into which a gene ( DNA ) was brought to the formation of the human life factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ate is a different in the European Union named Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , similarly , it is different , however , so that the drug contains no proteins of human or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies of patients with heavy up to moderate h@@ amm@@ op@@ hili@@ a A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was examined by means of prevention of blood vessels as well as in surgical procedures . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , the effectiveness of Adv@@ ance was evaluated in the prevention of blood tests in 86 % of 510 new blood @-@ sep@@ tics with &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; or with &quot; &quot; good &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed during 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are Sch@@ win@@ del , he@@ ada@@ ches , Py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( f@@ ever ) and the formation of antibodies to factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ate may not be used in patients who possibly hy@@ pers@@ ensi@@ tive ( allergic ) against the human sm@@ elling factor VIII , mouse or Ham@@ ster@@ ile or one of the other components . &quot;
March 2004 : the European Commission concluded the company Ba@@ x@@ ter AG for approval of Adv@@ ance in the entire European Union .
dosage Dos@@ age and duration of the sub@@ stitution treatment are based on the sever@@ ity of the factor VIII @-@ defect according to the place and the extent of blood flow and the clinical condition of the patient .
at the following hem@@ orrho@@ ag@@ an events the factor VIII activity in the appropriate period does not include the specified plasma level ( in % of the standard or in that / dl ) .

injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours for patients under 6 years ) repeat until the danger for the patient is above .
&quot; during treatment course , it is recommended to control the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections , proper determination of the factor VIII plasma levels . &quot;
&quot; individual patients may differ in their reaction to factor VIII , different in vi@@ vo Recovery and have different half @-@ value times . &quot;
3 proph@@ yla@@ xis For long @-@ term proph@@ yla@@ xis of blood vessels in patients with severe h@@ amm@@ op@@ hili@@ a A are to be doses of between 20 and 40 that can be given by factor VIII per kg body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected factor VIII can not be reached or if the blood circulation is not controlled with a reasonable dosage , a test must be carried out , in order to rep@@ licate a in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high incidence is possible , it is possible that the factor VIII treatment is not effective so that other therapeutic measures have to be er@@ ge@@ sted . &quot;
&quot; the administration speed should be paid after the satisfaction of the patient , with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alised antibodies against factor VIII is a known comp@@ lication in the treatment of patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A .
these inhi@@ bit@@ ors are always opposed to the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ative activity of factor VIII by Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lo@@ bul@@ ins that are in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml Plasma with modified Beth@@ es@@ da As@@ say quanti@@ fied .

&quot; due to the rare occurrence of the hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A in women , the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and breast@@ feeding has no experiences . &quot;
&quot; the A@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors present in the largest number of patients were inhi@@ bit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) who have used all in previously untreated patients who have a higher risk for education of inhi@@ bit@@ ors , he@@ ada@@ ches ( 5 patients ) , f@@ ever and Sch@@ win@@ del ( each 3 patients ) . &quot;

&quot; based on the data available , the CH@@ MP has continued the value @-@ risk weighing more than positive , but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored by the following reasons : &quot;
&quot; therefore , CH@@ MP on the basis of the safety pro@@ fil@@ s of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which is necessary to make a filing of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , decided that the filing should apply for another renewal procedure in 5 years . &quot;
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ec@@ ular Limited to the Committee of Human@@ arz@@ tend ( CH@@ MP ) officially recognised that the company particip@@ ates its application for approval by Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
&quot; however , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft parts ( tissues that connects the other structures in the body , surrounds and bases ) of it . &quot;
&quot; this is a type of virus that has changed , that it can wear a gene into the body of the body . &quot;
&quot; in the virus in Adv@@ exin it is a &quot; &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; &quot; that has been so changed that there cannot produce copies of itself and thus do not trigger infections in humans . &quot;
Adv@@ exin could have bol@@ ted directly into the tum@@ ors and allow the can@@ cer@@ ous cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein , which is made from which no def@@ ective in the human body existing p@@ 53 gene is formed , usually contributes to the restoration of corrupt DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered . &quot;
&quot; at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , with which the p@@ 53 gene is def@@ ective , the p@@ 53 protein is not correct , and the can@@ cers can continue to grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company put data from a study conducted with a patient by Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the field of sub @-@ construction , into the bones and in the brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP , the answers of the company had checked the questions on the questions were still unknown . &quot;
&quot; based on consideration of initial documents , CH@@ MP on Day 120 creates a list of questions that will be sent to the company . &quot;
according to the CH@@ MP not sufficiently proven that the injection of Adv@@ exin in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ore benefits for patients .
&quot; the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration , as well as the security of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company had not sufficiently proven that Adv@@ exin can be made in a reliable way and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
the company was not aware of the CH@@ MP not of whether the withdrawal of consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical studies or &quot; comp@@ assi@@ c use &quot; programmes with Adv@@ exin .
&quot; changed drug application , means that the tablets are so combined that one of the effective ingredients is immediately released and the other will be released over a few hours . &quot;
Aer@@ in@@ aze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( ha@@ y ha@@ y ) by an allergy to p@@ ollen ( infl@@ amm@@ ation of the n@@ as@@ al paths ) in patients with n@@ as@@ al skin @-@ sw@@ elling ( pet@@ ri@@ pe nose ) .
&quot; for adults and adolesc@@ ents from 12 years , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ aze is twice a tablet every day with a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and ended once the symptoms , above all the sw@@ elling of the n@@ as@@ end@@ omet@@ rium ( pet@@ ri@@ fied nose ) , reproduced . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be trac@@ ed to the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
&quot; the major contribut@@ or of the dimensions were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the ha@@ y , which were reported by the patient before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment . &quot;
&quot; during the study patients have spent their symptoms all 12 hours in a diary , and evaluated with a default sk@@ ala , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; in consideration of all ha@@ y @-@ cut symptoms , except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose reported the patients who attended the aer@@ op@@ sis , compared to 35.@@ 9 % in patients , the pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the sw@@ elling of the n@@ as@@ al skin was seen , the patients showed an all@@ evi@@ ation of symptoms around 3@@ 7,@@ 4 % compared to 26,@@ 7 % in patients , the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ aze ( observed during 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are T@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ ine ( cardi@@ ac ) , phar@@ yn@@ ge@@ ological hyper@@ activity , fatigue , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ enz ( s@@ ali@@ ity ) , ins@@ om@@ nia and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ aze may be in patients who possibly hy@@ pers@@ ensi@@ tive ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine or one of the other components , against in@@ ep@@ hr@@ ine active ingredients or Lor@@ at@@ adin ( a different medicines for treating allergies ) are not applied . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ aze should also not be applied in patients who suffer from a bott@@ len@@ kel@@ glau@@ coma ) , cardi@@ ac or ar@@ tery disease ( hyper@@ tension ) , cardi@@ ac disease or a hem@@ orrho@@ id stroke ( hyper@@ tension caused by the thy@@ roid ) or have a risk for a hem@@ at@@ ric stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission adopted the SP SP Europe a permit for the transfer of Aer@@ in@@ aze in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however , is in the whole to swal@@ low ( d. h. without distor@@ ting or ch@@ ew@@ ing ) . &quot;
&quot; the Aer@@ in@@ aze should be applied for in@@ conceivable and effectiveness due to the mis@@ conception and effectiveness ( see Section 5.1 ) not for children under 12 years of age . &quot;
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after finishing the symptoms .
&quot; it is recommended to limit the use of time on 10 days , since long @-@ term application use the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine to time . &quot;
after decrease the sw@@ elling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper breathing due to treatment in demand with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin as mon@@ otherapy .
&quot; since Aer@@ in@@ aze pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine contains , the medicine is also con@@ train@@ dic@@ ated in patients infected with a mon@@ o@@ amin@@ oxida@@ se ( MA@@ O ) inhi@@ bit@@ or or within the 2 weeks after the termination of such therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ e@@ tical activity with combined application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , with other vas@@ o@@ on@@ stri@@ pe , Per@@ go@@ lid , y@@ ur@@ id , mac@@ yl@@ ep@@ hr@@ ine , phen@@ yl@@ ep@@ hr@@ ine , eph@@ edr@@ ine , Ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ olin , Nap@@ haz@@ olin etc . ) . &quot;
&quot; the safety and effic@@ acy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient , and the data are not sufficient to notify the recommendations for dosage . &quot;
the safety and effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ aze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver functioning and the data are not sufficient to notify the dosage .
patients must be notified that treatment in occurrence of hyper@@ tension or a t@@ ach@@ y@@ fish or of pal@@ ates , cardi@@ ac disease or any other neuro@@ logical symp@@ tom ( such as he@@ ada@@ che or a strengthening of he@@ ada@@ ches ) must be set off .
&quot; in the treatment of following patients &quot; patients &quot; patients &quot; patients &quot; patients with cardi@@ ac disease • patients with cardi@@ ac disease • patients with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ din@@ ary in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , b@@ lowing @-@ construction or bronze @-@ enthusiasm in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ aze can reduce at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological testing , since Anti@@ hist@@ amine ika may prevent positive reactions to indicators for home actions or reduce it to their extent . &quot;
&quot; in the framework of clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , in which Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol in addition they were observed , however no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes of the Plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin were observed . &quot;
&quot; with the results of the psychological tests , there were no significant differences between the dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ine and those with plac@@ ebo @-@ treated patients regardless of whether disaster has been taken alone or with alcohol . &quot;
&quot; the enzy@@ mes for the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is still not identified , so that interactions with other medicines will not be excluded completely . &quot;
&quot; Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin inhi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ studies have shown that the drug is not inhi@@ bited and neither a substr@@ ate nor an in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ kop@@ ter . &quot;
the in@@ conceivable use of the application of Aer@@ in@@ aze during pregnancy is not guaranteed to take experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies . however no increase in frequency ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of normal population .
since re@@ production studies on animals are not always transferred to the people and due to the vas@@ o@@ stri@@ dium properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine should not be applied for aer@@ in@@ aze in pregnancy .
&quot; however , the patients should also be clear@@ ed that it may occur in very rare instances that may lead to a draw@@ backs of transport , or the ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary between a Z@@ NS depression ( Se@@ dation , Ap@@ no@@ e , decreased mental attention , Zy@@ an@@ osis , Kom@@ a , heart @-@ circul@@ atory ) and a Z@@ NS stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , trees , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ ins . &quot;

&quot; a Z@@ NS stimulation is particularly likely in children , just like A@@ trop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( mou@@ dry , p@@ up@@ y rigid and - di@@ lat@@ ation , housing , hyper@@ therm@@ ia and gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include both the release of the release of pro@@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory c@@ to@@ c@@ ine such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human Ma@@ st@@ cells / Bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the in@@ scription of the expression of the eag@@ er@@ sion@@ sm@@ ol@@ ek@@ ü@@ ls P @-@ Sel@@ ect@@ tin on end@@ ot@@ hel@@ cells . &quot;
&quot; in a single @-@ dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement sizes , including the strengthening of subjective bats or the tasks that are connected to the fingers . &quot;
in controlled clinical trials included in the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily no increased incidence of bats compared to plac@@ ebo .
&quot; the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in the recommended dosage can provide further sympath@@ om@@ im@@ e@@ tic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ fish or manifestations of a Z@@ NS arousal . &quot;
&quot; there were 1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis , with 4@@ 14 patients aer@@ in@@ aze tablets were received . &quot;
&quot; in both studies the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ aze tablets , determined by the total co@@ res for Symp@@ tom@@ atic ( except for n@@ as@@ al skin @-@ sw@@ elling ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ aze tablets with regard to the sw@@ elling effect determined by the n@@ as@@ al skin @-@ sw@@ elling was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin through the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or eth@@ ni@@ cer belonging .
as part of a single dose to Phar@@ mak@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ aze is des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin within 30 minutes after administration in plasma cutting .
&quot; after the per@@ or@@ ical application of Aer@@ og@@ aze in healthy actors over 14 days , the flow @-@ weight of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , 3 @-@ Hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine on day 10 reaches . &quot;
&quot; within the framework of a pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ professional student , which was performed with the formulation as a tablet to healthy adult promot@@ ers , was found that four promot@@ er@@ anden des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was poor@@ ly exchanged . &quot;
a components inter@@ acting shows that the exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine according to the sole genes of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine is equivalent to the exposure to G@@ abe of a Aer@@ in@@ aze tablet .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety sp@@ har@@ ology , for tox@@ icity in re@@ peti@@ tive gift , to gen@@ oto@@ x@@ icity and to re @-@ production , the pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin can not recognise any particular haz@@ ards to men . &quot;
the combination had no greater tox@@ icity than their individual components and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine .
in re@@ produ@@ ci@@ x@@ ik@@ ological studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adin / Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was used in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and on rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day non @-@ at@@ ogen@@ ous .

A@@ eri@@ us was tested in eight studies with about 4 800 adults and young people with allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( including four studies in seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis and two studies on patients who had also as@@ thma ) .
&quot; the effectiveness was measured by changing the change in symptoms ( itch , number and size of squares , imp@@ air@@ ment of sleep and the performance in the day ) before and after six @-@ week treatment . &quot;
&quot; there were further studies were submitted to prove that the bodies use the sy@@ ru@@ p , the solution for inser@@ ting and the mel@@ ting tab@@ let@@ tes in the same way evalu@@ ates like the tablets and the application in children is harmless . &quot;
&quot; in allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us became an average decrease of symp@@ tom ( symp@@ tom score ) by 25 to 26 % , compared to the acceptance of 12 to 26 % in patients who received a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies in Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the acceptance of symptoms after six @-@ term treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared with 40 and 33 % compared to plac@@ ebo @-@ treated patients . &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who possibly hy@@ pers@@ ensi@@ tive ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , Lor@@ at@@ adin or one of the other components . &quot;
&quot; January 2001 , the European Commission concluded the company SP Europe a permit for inclusion of A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to all@@ evi@@ ate the symptoms of allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and pers@@ ist allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see under Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there are limited experience of clinical studies on the effectiveness in the use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin with young people from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of inter@@ rup@@ ting allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be completed according to the previous hospital disease and may be resum@@ ed after the crash of symptoms and re @-@ re @-@ occur once again .
&quot; in the pers@@ ist allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( appearance of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) , patients may be recommended for continuous treatment during the aller@@ ia period . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions have been observed in the framework of clinical studies with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin tablets not found where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol additionally administered ( see under Section 5.1 ) .
in a clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological study has not been reinforced during con@@ current intake of alcohol and alcohol the performance of alcohol not reinforced ( see under section 5.1 ) .
&quot; however , the patients should also be clear@@ ed that it may occur in very rare instances that may lead to an imp@@ air@@ ment of transport , or the ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials in various indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , were reported in the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most commonly used side effects that was reported more frequently than in plac@@ ebo were tired@@ ness ( 1.2 % ) , mouth @-@ drying ( 0,@@ 8 % ) and he@@ ada@@ ches ( 0.7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial with 5@@ 78 you@@ thful patients from 12 to 17 years was the most common side @-@ effect he@@ ada@@ che , these were treated at 5.5 % of patients who were treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and were treated at 6.5 % of patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ class study , where up to 45 mg des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nin@@ et@@ een clinical dose ) were observed , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; this includes both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory c@@ to@@ c@@ ine such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human Ma@@ st@@ cells / Bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the in@@ scription of the expression of the eag@@ er@@ sion@@ sm@@ ol@@ ek@@ ü@@ ls P @-@ Sel@@ ect@@ tin to end@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ dal cells . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical trial with multi@@ disciplinary , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of up to 20 mg every day , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardi@@ ac effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in the dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ un@@ fold of clinical dose ) was administered for over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in single dos@@ ing study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement sizes , including the strengthening of subjective bats or the tasks that are connected to the fingers . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the all@@ evi@@ ation of symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , Nasen@@ secre@@ tion and Ju@@ ck@@ irrit@@ ation of the nose , Ju@@ ck@@ irrit@@ ation and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as itch on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis can be divided into dependence on the duration of symptoms , alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis and pers@@ isti@@ ble allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis is defined as a occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
pers@@ isti@@ ble allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis is defined as a occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks .
&quot; as with the total amount of life of the questionn@@ aire regarding the quality of life of Rhino @-@ sub@@ vi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively was caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis . &quot;
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tik@@ aria has been dep@@ uty for other forms of jud@@ g@@ aria since the underlying path@@ physiological ology is consistent with the ether in the different forms and chronic patients can become easier pro@@ spec@@ tive .
&quot; since the hist@@ ological conception is a key factor in all ancient idi@@ opath@@ ic diseases , is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is also reflected in the chron@@ ically idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tik@@ aria as well as in other forms of urine . this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first tin interval . &quot;
&quot; as in other studies with Anti@@ hist@@ amine ika in chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the minority of patients who do not rec@@ tified on anti@@ hist@@ amine ika , from the study . &quot;
an improvement of the itch to more than 50 % was observed at 55 % of the patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin patients compared to 19 % of the patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the disorder of sleep and of the wax substantially , as determined by a 4 @-@ score scale to the assessment of this variable . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tics study , in which the patients &quot; demo@@ graphic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis - population comparable to 4 % of patients achieved a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
there are no cl@@ ue for a clin@@ ically relevant c@@ ulation after once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
&quot; however , the enzy@@ mes for the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is still not identified , so that interactions with other medicines will not be excluded completely . &quot;
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin inhi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo not CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ studies have shown that the drug is not inhi@@ bited and neither a substr@@ ate nor an in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ kop@@ ter .

the clinical studies performed with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ at@@ adin performed during a compar@@ ative degree of exposure of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , no qualitative or quantitative differences with regard to the tox@@ icity pro@@ fil@@ s of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and by Lor@@ at@@ adin .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in re@@ peti@@ tive gift , gen@@ oto@@ x@@ icity and for re@@ production , the pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin can not recognise any particular haz@@ ards to men . &quot;

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independent of meals to all@@ evi@@ ate the symptoms of allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and pers@@ ist allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see under Section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ be doctor should be aware that most cases of r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis can be caused by an infection ( see under section 4.4 ) and that no data are necessary to support the treatment of inf@@ ectious r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis with A@@ ster@@ us .
&quot; apart from the exclusion of upper respir@@ atory infections or anatom@@ ical an@@ om@@ alies , during the diagnosis the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese , physical investigations and appropriate lab and skin exam@@ inations should play a role . &quot;
around 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabo@@ li@@ ze Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin can be restricted and experience a higher output load ( see under Section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ up in children between 2 and 11 years , the metabo@@ li@@ zed metabo@@ li@@ zed , is identical to those with children who are normal metabo@@ li@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; this medicine includes Sac@@ char@@ ose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients should not take suffer@@ ings with her@@ edit@@ ary problems of a fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , gl@@ uc@@ ose @-@ absorption or a Sac@@ char@@ ase @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suff@@ iciency of this medicine . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ depen@@ dencies were not found within the framework of clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets not observed when er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol additionally administered ( see under Section 5.1 ) .
in a clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological study has not been reinforced during con@@ gest@@ ing tablets and alcohol the performance of alcohol not reinforced ( see under section 5.1 ) .
the total sti@@ ff@@ ness of the side @-@ side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group as in the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; clinical trials with adults and young people in various indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , were reported in the recommended dose 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ class study on adults and young people , during which up to 45 mg des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nin@@ et@@ een clinical dose ) were observed , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; children aged between 1 and 11 years old , who received an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy in question , received a daily Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ind@@ osis of 1,25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2,5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) . &quot;
&quot; because the course of allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis / chron@@ ically idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tik@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin with adults and children are similar , the active data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin can be extr@@ acted by adults on the population &apos;s population . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical trial with multi@@ disciplinary adults and adolesc@@ ents , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of up to 20 mg used daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardi@@ ac effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study on adults and young people , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ un@@ fold of clinical dose ) was applied for over ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval . &quot;
in controlled clinical trials included in the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and teenagers no increased incidence of bats compared to plac@@ ebo .
with a single @-@ daily dose of 7.5 mg led A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and young people in clinical studies to no imp@@ air@@ ment of the Psych@@ ot@@ echnology .
&quot; in clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , it was neither an increase of alcohol neither to a strengthening of alcohol in@@ duced performance , nor to increase in bats . &quot;
&quot; in adult and adol@@ es@@ cent patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in the all@@ evi@@ ation of symptoms such as kid@@ neys , n@@ as@@ al secre@@ tion and irrit@@ ation of the eyes as well as itch on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; like using the total co@@ res of the questionn@@ aire regarding the quality of life of Rhino @-@ sub@@ vi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively was caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first tin interval . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this limited metabo@@ li@@ ant phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ ca@@ sians ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
&quot; similar pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ oc@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with the si@@ re @-@ formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis , which is limited to li@@ ze . &quot;
the burden ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was about 3 to 6 hours higher and the C@@ max approximately 3 to 4@@ times higher with a tempor@@ al half @-@ time period of about 120 hours .
&quot; there are no limit points for a clin@@ ically relevant active ingredient , after once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and young people . &quot;
&quot; 12 In various single dose studies showed that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin were compared with pedi@@ at@@ ric patients with the recommended doses were compared to those of adults , the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin @-@ sy@@ up in a dosage of 5 mg . &quot;
&quot; however , the enzy@@ mes for the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is still not identified , so that interactions with other medicines will not be excluded completely . &quot;

&quot; immediately before the application , the bli@@ ster must carefully be opened and the dosage of the ly@@ op@@ hil@@ ate should be taken from , without damage them . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found within the framework of clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets not found where Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol additionally were used ( see under Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; clinical trials in various indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , were reported in the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , than in patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ class study , used up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nin@@ et@@ een clinical dose ) were observed , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; in two single @-@ dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate was well toler@@ ated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical exam@@ inations , vitality and EC@@ G data data . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical trial with multi@@ disciplinary , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , in a dosage of up to 20 mg used daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardi@@ ac effect was described . &quot;

&quot; in an additional study , in an additional study were observed in a single dose of 2.5 mg des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine solution for taking no side effects in patients aged between 6 and 11 years . &quot;
with the recommended dosage the plasma concentr@@ ations were comparable by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( see under Section 5.2 ) in the child &apos;s and adult population .
in controlled clinical trials included in the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and teenagers no increased incidence of bats compared to plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis can vary depending on the duration of symptoms , alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis and &quot;
&quot; like using the total co@@ res of the questionn@@ aire regarding the quality of life of Rhino @-@ sub@@ vi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively was caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this limited metabo@@ li@@ ant phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ ca@@ sians ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
&quot; since A@@ eri@@ us solution for taking the same concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin contains , there was no bio @-@ qui@@ val@@ ency which is required and it is expected that they correspond to the sy@@ ru@@ p and the tablets . &quot;
&quot; in various retail studies , AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin showed that recommended patients with the recommended doses were compared to those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin @-@ sy@@ up in a dosage of 5 mg . &quot;

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. to the Committee of Human@@ arz@@ tend ( CH@@ MP ) officially released that the company takes its application for approval of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to prevent the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 In@@ flu@@ enza in adults and elderly people .
&quot; A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be caused by adults and elderly people to protect flu , caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus . &quot;
&quot; this is a special kind of vaccine which could cause any tribe of the Gri@@ p@@ pe@@ virus , which might cause a future pan@@ demic . &quot;
&quot; Gri@@ pp@@ ep@@ an@@ dem@@ ie breaks off when a new tribe of the Gri@@ p@@ pe@@ virus emerg@@ es , which can easily be spread from man to man because men still have no immun@@ ity ( no protection ) against it . &quot;
&quot; after administration of the vaccine the immune system recogni@@ zes the parts of the Gri@@ p@@ pe@@ virus as &quot; &quot; physically &quot; &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the immune system will be able to form a contact with a Gri@@ p@@ pe@@ virus of this pedi@@ gree . &quot;
&quot; afterwards , the membrane envel@@ ope of the virus with the &quot; surface @-@ anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which recogni@@ zes the human body as a body @-@ alien ) separated and used as an integral part of the vaccine . &quot;
&quot; an inspection of some of the study centres showed that the study was not conducted according to the &quot; &quot; good clinical practice &quot; &quot; ( G@@ CP ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the extent of the clinical data base for assessing the security of the vaccine does not come out to meet the requirements of the guidelines of the E@@ MEA area for pre @-@ pan@@ demic vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; should you take part in a clinical trial and need further information about your treatment , please contact your individual doctor . &quot;
&quot; if you want more information regarding the recommendations of CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in combination with other anti@@ vir@@ al medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are caused by human immun@@ ology virus from type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which is caused by the acquired immun@@ ology De@@ fic@@ iency Syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who can &apos;t swal@@ low the capsules , it stands as a solution for dispos@@ able yet , but these can not be taken along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the safety of this combination has not been studied . &quot;
&quot; A@@ ins@@ ase should only be ordered if the doctor has checked , which anti @-@ vir@@ al medicines has been taken before , and the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood has judged that the virus is addressed to the drug . &quot;
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which together with twice daily 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ vir@@ al medicines . &quot;
in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a weight of less than 50 kg the recommended dose of ast@@ ase according to body weight .
A@@ gener@@ ase reduces the HIV amount in blood in combination with other anti@@ vir@@ al medicines and keeps them at a low level .
&quot; AIDS not to cure AIDS , however , may delay the damage of the immune system and thus delay the development of AIDS associated infections and diseases . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was treated in combination with other anti@@ vir@@ al medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , examined in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults , which previously had not been treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ al numbers . &quot;
&quot; this compared with low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced medicinal drugs , was compared with 206 adults , formerly compared with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ former numbers . &quot;
main indicators for the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with non @-@ evident concentr@@ ations of HIV in the blood ( Vir@@ us@@ last ) or the change in the virus last after treatment .
&quot; in the studies with patients who had previously had no prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ iah , although after 48 weeks , more patients had a Vir@@ us@@ last under 400 copies / ml than under plac@@ ebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children decreased A@@ gener@@ ase also the Vir@@ us@@ last , but were treated by the children who were formerly treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ al numbers , only very few on the treatment . &quot;
in the study involving adults who were treated earlier with prot@@ e@@ as@@ al Num@@ bers who were treated with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced drug A@@ gener@@ ase the Vir@@ us@@ last after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ iah :
&quot; in patients with HIV , that was against four other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ iah resistance , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste of Vir@@ us@@ last after four weeks than with the patients who participated in their previous protests : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are he@@ ada@@ che , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , Flat@@ ul@@ ence ( bl@@ ur@@ ation ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , v@@ om@@ iting , rash and Ill@@ nesses ( fatigue ) . &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients that may be hy@@ pers@@ ensi@@ tive ( allergic ) against Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r or one of the other components .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase may also not be used in patients whose cur@@ is@@ kr@@ aut ( a herbal remedy for treating depression ) or drugs , which are exactly as ag@@ gener@@ ase and are in high concentr@@ ations in the blood health harmful . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines against HIV exists in patients , the A@@ gener@@ ase , the risk of Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of the body fat ) , a oste@@ ac@@ tic syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of disease infection ) or an immun@@ re@@ activation syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of an infection which are caused by the moving immune system ) . &quot;
the Committee for Human@@ arz@@ tend ( CH@@ MP ) contributed to the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines used to treat HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken along with the pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee believed that the benefits of ast@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously been detected no prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ iah . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; as at the time of approval for scientific reasons only limited information . &quot;
October 2000 presented the European Commission to the Gla@@ xo Group Limited as a permit for the transport of ins@@ ase in the entire European Union .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1- infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ former adults and children from 4 years onwards . &quot;
&quot; usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules to be administered for pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tic Boo@@ bs together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the use of Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r should take place under consideration of the individual vir@@ al resistance pattern and the pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the bio@@ availability of am@@ it@@ avi@@ r , as a solution to take is 14 % less than a capsule ; therefore , ins@@ ase capsules and solution to take on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for ast@@ ase capsules is 600 mg am@@ or@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines .
&quot; 2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules without the ampli@@ fication of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ stery ) are applied , higher doses must be applied to A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for ast@@ ase capsules is 20 mg am@@ it@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines that should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; Pharmac@@ ology , effectiveness and safety of gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ e@@ as@@ al numbers were not examined in children . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the mis@@ conception and effectiveness ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with heavy liver dys@@ functions to 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application is to be done with caution in patients with mild or moderate hep@@ atitis , in patients with severe liver functioning , it is con@@ train@@ dic@@ ally ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase is not at the same time with drugs that possess a small therapeutic width and also display substr@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzy@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal supplements which are Johann@@ is@@ kr@@ aut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) may not be applied due to the risk of reduced plasma concentr@@ ations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r during the intake of Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be pointed out that ast@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opport@@ un@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy including the treatment of gener@@ ase prevents not the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contam@@ ination with blood .
&quot; usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are to be applied together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients who suffer from chronic hep@@ atitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al Com@@ mod@@ ulation therapy have increased risk for severe liver impacts with potentially fatal consequences .
for the event of simultaneous anti@@ vir@@ al treatment of hep@@ atitis B or C please read the relevant information of these medicines .
patients with existing reduced liver function including a chronic @-@ active hep@@ atitis show an increased frequency of liver dys@@ functions under a anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
&quot; the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ ason or other gl@@ uc@@ co@@ or@@ tic ampli@@ fiers , which is not recommended over CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , it is not recommended that the potential benefits of treating the risk of system@@ ic Cor@@ si@@ ost@@ ero@@ i@@ der Eff@@ ects , including Mor@@ bus Cus@@ du@@ es and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function predomin@@ ates ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ er Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ ult@@ atin greatly depend on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . it is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ y and Sim@@ ult@@ atin because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sen .
&quot; 4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , Phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Standards Association ) , are methods to determine the drug con@@ dens@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in patients who take these medicines at the same time , A@@ ins@@ ase may be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of metabo@@ lic interactions with Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormonal contrasts can be changed , however the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on an op@@ aque symptoms , especially if there is also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the possible risk of tox@@ icity , due to the high prop@@ yl@@ engl@@ y@@ col@@ oni@@ al@@ ts of the A@@ ins@@ ase solution to ins@@ ect is con@@ train@@ dic@@ ated in children under a age of four years and should be applied with caution at certain other patients . &quot;
&quot; A@@ ins@@ ase should be set on length 5 , if a rash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms , or the vei@@ ls are involved ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients who received an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy , including prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ iah , reported via the appearance of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia or an exposure of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . &quot;
many of the patients had other diseases related to their therapy medicines which were associated with the development of a diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or a hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ emia .
&quot; B. higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment and related metabo@@ lic disorders . &quot;

&quot; although a multi@@ fact@@ orial ether is accepted ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , heavy immun@@ os@@ cope , higher Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ) , cases were reported by O@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose especially in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 substr@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with drugs that possess a small therapeutic width and also display substr@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzy@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
&quot; CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substr@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be distributed along with drugs , their active ingredients are mostly linked via CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , and are connected to the increased plasma levels with he@@ aters and / or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects . &quot;
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to an vi@@ logical verse and lead to a resistance development . &quot;
&quot; with the attempt to exp@@ elled the lower plasma seal by a dosage increase of other protein @-@ inhi@@ bit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , were often observed unwanted effects on the liver . &quot;
Johann@@ is@@ kr@@ aut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) The Ser@@ um mirror of Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r can be taken due to the simultaneous application of herbal supplements with Johann@@ is@@ kr@@ aut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) .

a dosage adjustment for one of the medicine is not necessary when Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz below ) .
5@@ 08 % increased for C@@ max against 30 % lower if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) administered .
&quot; in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg am@@ or@@ avi@@ r twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily applied to the effic@@ acy and imm@@ ort@@ ality of this treatment plant . &quot;
52 % lower when Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) administered .
&quot; C@@ min values from Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were obtained when the combination of Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily administered . &quot;
&quot; a dosage intake for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , there will be a closer monitoring , since the effectiveness and imm@@ ort@@ ality of this combination is unknown . &quot;
&quot; there was no pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tic study conducted in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but due to the ant@@ acid the component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine is recommended that the revenue from Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine and A@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see Ant@@ azi@@ da below ) . &quot;
therefore at G@@ core of E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dosage adjustment required .
&quot; the treatment with eg@@ i@@ avi@@ r@@ enz in combination with Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , as the exposure of both protests . &quot;
the effect of Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ ine to other prot@@ e@@ as@@ former and existing limited data can be wast@@ ed that Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ on is possibly sen@@ sed by Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; if these medicines should be utilized at the same time , caution is advisable , since Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plastic mas@@ pi@@ ps could be less effective . &quot;
&quot; if these medicines will be applied together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out , as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of combination of Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
the simultaneous gift of Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to a rise in the plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin to 193 % and with it a rise in the side effects associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
&quot; if it is required for clinical reasons , ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin may be applied together with A@@ gener@@ ase , becomes a reduction in dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose , although there is no clinical data . &quot;
&quot; Phar@@ mak@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed , however , the plasma levels of both medicines could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration . &quot;
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once daily lead to an increase in the C@@ max of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once daily without any simultaneous application of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r observed .
&quot; other medicines that are listed below , including substr@@ ates , inhi@@ bit@@ or in@@ duc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can be used together with A@@ gener@@ ase , possibly lead to interactions . &quot;
patients should therefore be related to toxic reactions which are associated with these drugs when they are applied in combination with gener@@ ase .
&quot; based on the data of other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ iah it is advisable that ant@@ acid is not taken at the same time as ast@@ re@@ ase , since it can come to res@@ or@@ ption problems . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ s@@ ants , which are known as an enzy@@ mes ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r , can lead to a degra@@ dation of the plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ egel of Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r . &quot;

&quot; simultaneous intake associated with A@@ gener@@ ase can increase their plasma concentr@@ ations considerably , and strengthen with PD@@ E@@ 5 @-@ inhi@@ bit@@ ors in combination standing side effects including mort@@ gage , visual dys@@ functions and pri@@ ap@@ hor@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
in a clinical trial in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of pro@@ b@@ ons were significantly increased during the end@@ ogen@@ e Kor@@ ti@@ sol rose by approximately 86 % ( 90 % -@@ Con@@ fi@@ den@@ z@@ interval 82 to 89 % ) .
&quot; consequently , the simultaneous gift of ast@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended along with these gl@@ uc@@ ose oids , unless that the potential benefits of treating the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ tical ster@@ oids ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; at H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ er @-@ Hem@@ m@@ ates like Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ ult@@ atin , whose compar@@ isons is strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are pronounced enh@@ ancements of Plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ egel at con@@ current administration of A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
since Plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ pers increased by these H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ er @-@ Hem@@ m@@ ile to my@@ opath@@ y including an R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ se , the combined application of these medicines with am@@ or@@ avi@@ r is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; it will be recommended for frequent monitoring of therapeu@@ tical concentr@@ ations until the stabil@@ isation of the mirror , since the plasma concentration of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased during con@@ current gift of Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase may not be applied together with an oral recorded Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , while with simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution . &quot;
data for the simultaneous application of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ on@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in plasma cutting from Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ on around the 3- up to 4 @-@ fold .
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on an op@@ aque symptoms , especially if there is also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the slight neg@@ ligence of historical compar@@ isons , at the moment no recommendation can be given , as the Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r@@ - dose is to adapt when Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r is administered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ on . &quot;
&quot; with con@@ current gift of War@@ far@@ in or other or@@ thodon@@ tic antibodies together with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased monitoring of the IN@@ R ( International Standards Association ) is recommended due to the possibility of a weak@@ ening or strengthening of anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effects ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect of an additional administration by Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tive is not predic@@ table , therefore alternative methods are recommended for contrac@@ eption . &quot;
a careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( for example D@@ esi@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended for con@@ current gift of A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; this medicine may only be applied during pregnancy , only after careful checking of possible utility for the mother compared to the possible risks for Fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in the milk of de@@ activated rats , Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were proven , it is not known whether Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r is over@@ flowing with people into the mother &apos;s milk . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study on the imp@@ air@@ ment in the uter@@ us to the end of stagn@@ ation in the uter@@ us until the end of the l@@ ac@@ tation of am@@ or@@ avi@@ r , showed during the l@@ ac@@ tation period an decreased increase of 12 body weight in the post @-@ ups . &quot;
the further development of the in@@ comes including fer@@ til@@ ation and re@@ production capacity was not affected by the administration of Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r to the mother &apos;s animal .
the in@@ conceivable of A@@ gener@@ ase was examined in adults and in children from 4 years in controlled clinical studies in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines .
&quot; most associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment have been slightly pronounced , they played early on and often resulted in a treatment break . &quot;
&quot; in many of these events is not clear whether it is related to the intake of as@@ gener@@ ase or another simultaneously to HIV treatment medicines , or whether they are a result of cru@@ ising disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the side @-@ mentioned side effects come from two clinical studies ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which with prot@@ e@@ as@@ formerly patients were not previously treated patients 1200 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily . &quot;
&quot; events ( degree 2 to 4 ) , developed by the investig@@ ator as well as in connection with the study medicine , and in more than 1 % of patients were applied , as well as under the treatment of appropri@@ ated laboratory changes ( degree 3 to 4 ) are listed . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of the body @-@ fat ( Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV @-@ patients , including a loss of periph@@ eral and fa@@ ther@@ y fat tissues , more powerful in@@ tra@@ oc@@ ular and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissues , hyper@@ trop@@ hia of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ al fat . &quot;
&quot; under 113 anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al not previously treated persons , which were treated with Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r in combination with Lam@@ iv@@ u@@ din / Zi@@ dov@@ u@@ din , a medium duration of 36 weeks has been observed ( &lt; 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 appeared at 245 NR@@ TI@@ - pre @-@ treated patients under Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in combination with various NR@@ TI@@ s over a medium duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; skin sur@@ charges were normally easy to moderate , er@@ y@@ them@@ at@@ ös@@ er or mak@@ ul@@ op@@ ap@@ ul@@ cer nature , with or without itch and disappeared spont@@ aneously during the second treatment week and disappeared spont@@ aneously within two weeks , without being broken with Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r . &quot;

in the time of introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory reaction to as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ ous opport@@ un@@ istic infections ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in with PI , the 600 mg of gener@@ ase were observed twice daily along with low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( degrees 3 and 4 ) those who were observed among all au@@ xili@@ aries of the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ d@@ - and CP@@ K values that were used in patients , the A@@ gener@@ ase together with low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;

&quot; the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns can be subject to change through additional data , and it is recommended to always move the current interpre@@ tations to analyse the results of resistance tests . &quot;
based on phenomen@@ al resistance based analyses of clin@@ ically vali@@ dated patterns can be applied in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ ical data for the estim@@ ation of the activity of am@@ or@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r
firms who exp@@ el the diagnostic resistance tests have clin@@ ically @-@ phenomen@@ al Cut @-@ off@@ s ( divi@@ ding points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV developed to be applied to the interpretation of results of a resistance tests .
&quot; each of these four with a reduced sensitivity against Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r associated genetic pattern creates a certain clo@@ ister against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity against In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r but generally preserved . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data for cross @-@ resistant between Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ e@@ as@@ al numbers for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r Resi@@ st@@ enz@@ ade , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;

&quot; the other way around , Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r re@@ tains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ iah resistance . the preservation of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and the type of Resi@@ st@@ ence @-@ mut@@ ations in the ins@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; the early inter@@ ruption of a vers@@ ing therapy is recommended to hold the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in borders , which can affect the subsequent treatment . &quot;
&quot; the cover of the effectiveness of ast@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized trial ( Vir@@ us@@ last ≥ 1000 copies / ml ) either with a standard therapy ( standard of care , so@@ c ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , so@@ c ) with a PI , mostly with low @-@ do@@ z@@ avi@@ r &quot; b@@ oo@@ stered &quot; , &quot; received . &quot;
&quot; one @-@ two @-@ six@@ ty @-@ six@@ ty @-@ six@@ ty ) patients with down@@ scale virus @-@ sensitivity towards A@@ ins@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one NR@@ TI were included into the sub@@ study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
the primary analysis presented the non @-@ sub @-@ leg@@ ality of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the So@@ C @-@ PI group with regard to the time @-@ long average transformation of the starting point ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) within the plasma after 16 weeks in a non @-@ basement shaft of 0.7 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
&quot; the cover of the effectiveness of un@@ ted map@@ le @-@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 288 HIV infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were treated with PI . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , A@@ ins@@ ase solution to take home and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; it was not given no low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI patients had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the co @-@ gener@@ ic NR@@ TI@@ s . &quot;
&quot; after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the patients included a plasma @-@ 1 @-@ RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml with a medi@@ an increase of the CD@@ 4 cell number from 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value . &quot;
19 Basi@@ ating on these data should be considered in the treatment optimisation with PI @-@ treated children of the expected benefits of &quot; un@@ signed &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; according to oral administration , the average duration ( t@@ max ) to the maximum capacity of Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approx . 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
5@@ 08 % increased if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) combined with Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
&quot; the administration of Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % discount of the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the minimum concentration at ste@@ ady @-@ State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ influenced by the food intake , although the simultaneous food intake the extent and rate of Res@@ or@@ ption influences . &quot;
the seem@@ ing volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and leaves a large distribution volume as well as an enormous penetration of Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r from the bloo@@ d@@ stream into the tissue .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the drug in the plasma , with the quantity of un@@ connected am@@ or@@ avi@@ r , which is likely to be the active part , probably unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while absolute concentration remains unchanged , fluctu@@ ates the percentage of free active component throughout the doses of free active component in the Ste@@ ady @-@ State above the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines that may indu@@ ce CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ duced or inhi@@ bit or have a substr@@ ate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , be given with caution when they are simultaneously associated with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the property of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily am@@ y avi@@ r exposure like in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r is derived from the solution 14 % less bi@@ ased than from the capsules ; therefore A@@ ins@@ ase solution and ast@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable at a milli@@ ram base .
&quot; also , the ren@@ al clear@@ ance was neg@@ li@@ gible by Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , therefore the effect of a ren@@ al @-@ function is likely to be low to the elimination of am@@ or@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
these treatment schem@@ ata lead to Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r plasma mas@@ pi@@ ds comparable to those who are att@@ ained to healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r twice daily without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day .

the 21 underlying mechanism for the origin of the hep@@ at@@ onic Aden@@ ome and car@@ cin@@ ome was not yet clear and the relevance of these observed effects for man is un@@ clear .
&quot; arising out of the present exposure data on people , both from clinical studies and the therapeutic application , however , take little evidence of the acceptance of a clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ Gen@@ oto@@ x@@ icity testing , the bacterial re@@ verse mut@@ ation tests , micro@@ kern@@ els of rats and chromos@@ omes , included in human periph@@ eral l@@ ymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , was Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ oto@@ x@@ ically . &quot;
&quot; this liver tox@@ icity can be monitored and proven in clinical daily life through measurement of A@@ ST , ALT and the activity of al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ ate systems . &quot;
&quot; previously , in clinical studies no significant liver tox@@ icity in patients have been observed , neither during administration of A@@ gener@@ ase nor after the treatment of treatment . &quot;
&quot; studies on tox@@ icity in juven@@ iles , which were treated as well as at the age of 4 days , both in the audit@@ ing as well as with the Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r treated animals . &quot;
&quot; in a system@@ ic plasma exposure , which was significant among ( rab@@ bit ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure under therapeutic dosage , however , were observed a number of minor changes including Th@@ y@@ mus@@ el@@ ong@@ ation and low sk@@ elet@@ on changes that are observed on a changing development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules without the ampli@@ fication of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ stery ) are applied , higher doses must be applied to A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for ast@@ ase capsules is 20 mg am@@ it@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines that should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the simultaneous application is to be done with caution in patients with watch@@ er or light liver , in patients with severe liver functioning , it is con@@ train@@ dic@@ ally ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , Phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Standards Association ) , are methods to determine the drug con@@ dens@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; A@@ ins@@ ase should be set on length 27 , if a rash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms , or the vei@@ ls are involved ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; an increased risk for a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment and related metabo@@ lic disorders . &quot;
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to an vi@@ logical verse and lead to a resistance development . &quot;

&quot; C@@ min values from Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were obtained when the combination of Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily administered . &quot;
&quot; a dosage intake for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , there will be a closer monitoring , since the effectiveness and imm@@ ort@@ ality of this combination is unknown . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with eg@@ i@@ avi@@ r@@ enz in combination with Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , as the exposure of both protests . &quot;
&quot; if these medicines will be applied together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out , as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of combination of Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;

the in@@ conceivable of A@@ gener@@ ase was examined in adults and in children from 4 years in controlled clinical studies in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines .
&quot; in case of over@@ dose the patient is on signs of in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see Section 4.8 ) to observe if required , necessary support measures are necessary . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ vir@@ al activity of Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B has been studied both by ac@@ ute and chronic infected cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as periph@@ eral bloo@@ d@@ ymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;

the most common side effects of Al@@ dara ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the use of cre@@ ams ( pain or itch ) .
&quot; clinical typical , not hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ otic , not hyper@@ tro@@ ph@@ onic Ker@@ at@@ ants ( A@@ KS ) in the face or on the scal@@ p in immun@@ opath@@ ic adults , if the size or number of l@@ esi@@ ons limit the effectiveness and / or the acceptance of hard therapy limit or other top@@ ical treatment options con@@ train@@ dic@@ ated or less suitable . &quot;
&quot; Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday ) before going to leave and leave 6 to 10 hours on the skin . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream is as long to continue , until all the visible fail@@ ures in genital or periods has disappeared , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks a treatment period . &quot;
&quot; inter@@ ruption within the above treatment process should be er@@ ge@@ sted , if intensive local infl@@ amm@@ ation actions occur ( see Section 4.4 ) or if in the treatment area an infection is observed . &quot;
&quot; if during the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the l@@ esi@@ ons were only incomplete , another therapy should be started ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
if a dose was om@@ itted to carry the patient the cream once he / she noticed this and then proceed with the usual therapy plan .
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Cre@@ me is in a thin layer to wear and cast into the framed , with fail@@ ures to ru@@ ed up the cre@@ ams completely . &quot;
&quot; in case of these patients , it should be done between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible wor@@ sen@@ ing of its auto@@ immune disease . &quot;
&quot; in case of these patients , it should be done between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with an possible source output or GRA@@ FT versus @-@ host@@ - reaction . &quot;
&quot; in other studies , in which no daily occurrence was performed , two cases of severe ph@@ im@@ osis and one case with one to the circum@@ cis@@ ion is observed . &quot;
&quot; in an application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream , in higher than the recommended doses , an increased risk for heavy local skin irrit@@ ation ( see Section 4.2 . ) In rare cases have also observed under knowled@@ geable application of heavy local skin irrit@@ ation , which took treatment required and / or to a temporary physical imp@@ air@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions arrive at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had trouble passing the wat@@ erm@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area . &quot;
&quot; to the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream , immediately after treatment with other cut@@ aneous methods for the treatment of outer f@@ eig@@ war@@ ts in genital and periodi@@ cal area , there are no clinical experiences yet . &quot;
&quot; limited data suggest to an increased rate of fail@@ ures reduction in HIV @-@ positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Cre@@ me has shown in this patient group with regard to the elimination of traps , however , a lower effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; the treatment of the cell car@@ cin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm to the eyel@@ id , the nose , the lips or the hair@@ line has not been investigated . &quot;
&quot; local dw@@ ell@@ ings are common , but the intensity of these reactions generally takes effect during therapy or the reactions come back after completing the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream . &quot;
&quot; if it is required due to the complaints of the patient , or because of the sever@@ ity of local dw@@ ell@@ ings , may be made a treatment break of several days . &quot;
the clinical result of therapy can be assessed after regeneration of the skin treated approximately 12 weeks after the treatment .
&quot; there is currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after treatment , should be considered with super@@ fic@@ i@@ ally cell car@@ cin@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ C@@ s are no clinical experiences before , the application is not recommended in previously treated tum@@ ors . &quot;
data from an open clinical trial suggest that in large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) is a lower chance of response to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not tested for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ess not@@ ches , inside the nose or the ears or on the lip area within the lip . &quot;
there are only very limited data about the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of acoustic ben@@ ches to anatom@@ ical places outside the face and the scal@@ p .
&quot; the available data about the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose on the fore@@ arms and hands support the effectiveness of this application , therefore a such application is not recommended . &quot;
local f@@ ences are frequently occurring but these reactions usually take effect in the course of treatment on intensity or go back after gradu@@ ating the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
&quot; if local home actions can cause great discomfort or very strong , the treatment can be suspended for a few days . &quot;
&quot; from the data of an open clinical trial , patients with more than 8 AK@@ - l@@ esi@@ ons reported a lower full healing rate than patients with less than 8 l@@ esi@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; due to the imm@@ ac@@ tional properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od Cre@@ me should be applied with caution in patients who receive an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; animal studies do not go direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , the embryonic development , the compensation , or the post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; although neither after non @-@ recur@@ ring application quanti@@ fied Ser@@ um@@ spiegel ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) have been reached , no recommendation can be given during the breast@@ feeding period . &quot;
the most common involved and as likely or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Cre@@ me related side effects in the studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions to the place of treatment of f@@ eig@@ war@@ ts ( 33.@@ 7 % of the patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated patients ) .
&quot; among the most frequently reported and as likely or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Cre@@ me related side effects belong to complaints at the application location , with an incidence of 28,@@ 1 % . &quot;
the patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Cre@@ me treated bas@@ ali@@ om patients from a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trial of phase III reported side effects are listed below .
&quot; the most common , as likely or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cre@@ ams in relation to this studies were a reaction at the application location ( 22 % of the patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated patients ) . &quot;
the side effects that are specified by 252 in plac@@ eb@@ ok@@ on@@ controlled clinical studies of phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Cre@@ me treated patients with acoustic co@@ at@@ osis are listed below .
&quot; this according to the test schedule proposed evaluation of the clinical signs provided that it happened in these plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream , ero@@ sion ( 30 % ) , ero@@ sion ( 30 % ) , Ex@@ c@@ ori@@ ation / Dep@@ os@@ itors ( 23 % ) and oil ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; this according to the test schedule proposed evaluation of the clinical signs illustr@@ ates that in these studies with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Cre@@ me very often to serious Er@@ y@@ them@@ en ( 31 % ) , heavy ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and to heavy loads ( 19 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies to investigate the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis , Alo@@ pe@@ zie was determined with a frequency of 0.7 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment point or in the surrounding area . &quot;
&quot; the unbe@@ atable unique or@@ ale reception of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags might lead to nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , he@@ ada@@ che , my@@ al@@ gi@@ es and f@@ ever . &quot;
&quot; the clin@@ ically wei@@ rd side effect , which came to several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted in hyp@@ ot@@ ony , which is norm@@ alized after oral or in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous fluid . &quot;
in a pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tic investigation were detected after the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od increasing system@@ ic concentr@@ ations of the alpha inter@@ fer@@ on and other cy@@ to@@ c@@ ine .
in 3 permanent phase 3 mode studies could be shown that the effectiveness in relation to a complete pay@@ roll of the f@@ eig@@ war@@ ts in an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment is clearly superior over 16 weeks of a plac@@ ebo treatment .
at 60 % of the total 119 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy the f@@ eig@@ war@@ ts were complete ; this was at 20 % of the 105 with plac@@ ebo therapy in the case ( 95 % CI ) :
&quot; full detection could be achieved at 23 % of 157 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients , compared to 5 % of 161 with plac@@ ebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od during a week of five weeks a week over 6 weeks has been investigated in two double fl@@ ashes , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies . &quot;
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ological confirmed individual primary super@@ ficial cell car@@ cin@@ oma with a minimum size of 0.5 cm ² and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
&quot; the data from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years of present data show that approximately 7@@ 9.3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured , and this was also 48 months long . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in three times weekly application in one or two treatment rooms of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was investigated in two double fl@@ ashes , plac@@ eb@@ ok@@ on@@ controlled clinical studies . &quot;

the in@@ verse data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ rent rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) .
the approved indications of external f@@ eig@@ war@@ ts , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis and super@@ fi@@ zi@@ elles bas@@ al cell patients are usually not tested and were therefore not examined .
&quot; Al@@ dara Cre@@ me was investigated in four random@@ ised , double fl@@ ashes of plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies to children aged 2 to 15 years with Moll@@ us@@ c@@ um Cont@@ agi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 576 , plac@@ ebo n = 313 ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies at the doses sought ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks b@@ z@@ w .
a minimum system inclusion of the 5 % of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Cre@@ me through the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose was observed during the three times weekly application during 16 weeks .

treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor which has experience in the treatment of patients with MP@@ S I or other her@@ edit@@ ary metabo@@ lic disorders .
the initial inf@@ usion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased when the patient contributes to a maximum number of 43 E / kg / h .
the security and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with adults over 65 years has not been determined and for these patients no dos@@ ing scheme can be recommended .
the security and effic@@ acy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver suff@@ iciency has not been determined and for these patients no dos@@ ing scheme can be recommended .
&quot; with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me patients may develop inf@@ usion @-@ borne reactions , which are defined as each related side effect that occurs during inf@@ usion or until the end of the inf@@ usion day ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , specifically these patients should continue to be monitored and the inf@@ usion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out only in a reasonable clinical environment , in which re@@ vit@@ ational equipment for medical emergency assistance should be made available immediately . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase 3 study , that nearly all patients are Ig@@ G @-@ antibodies against lar@@ oni@@ da@@ se , usually within 3 months from the course of treatment . &quot;
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; because little experience regarding the resum@@ ption of treatment after a longer break , must be cau@@ tious due to the theoretical risk of over@@ sensitivity after a break of the treatment . &quot;
60 minutes before the start of inf@@ usion with drugs ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and / or anti@@ Py@@ re@@ tica ) to minimize the potential occurrence of inf@@ usion @-@ borne reactions .
&quot; in case of light or medium @-@ heavy inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction , the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen were wo@@ unded and / or a reduction of inf@@ usion rate based on half of inf@@ usion rate , in which the reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in case of a single , heavy inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction , the inf@@ usion must be stopped until the symptoms are brought to decrease , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to consider . &quot;
inf@@ usion can be included with a reduction of inf@@ usion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of inf@@ usion rate in which the reaction occurred .

&quot; the side effects in clinical studies were ordered mainly as inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions , which were observed at 53 % of patients in the phase 3 study ( treatment of up to 4 years ) and at 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years of treatment ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) . &quot;
&quot; unwanted pharmaceutical companies in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during the phase @-@ 3 study and their renewal in total 45 patients aged 5 years or older at a treatment duration of up to 4 years , are listed in the following table following : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) . &quot;
&quot; in some patients with severe MP@@ S @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper air@@ ways and lungs in the pre @-@ history , there were heavy reactions , including bronze @-@ enthusiasm , breathing still@@ s and facial pe@@ al ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children un@@ desired drug interactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported in the table with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with predomin@@ antly severe verse form and a treatment duration up to 12 months , reported in the table . &quot;

&quot; the safety and effic@@ acy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ised , double fl@@ ashes , plac@@ eb@@ ok@@ on@@ controlled phase @-@ 3 study on 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , the majority of patients were reported by the middle of the phenomenon , and only one patient pointed to the severe phen@@ otype . &quot;
&quot; patients have been en@@ cro@@ oked if they had an for@@ ated exp@@ ir@@ ator volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and 5 meters to walk . &quot;
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute walk@@ way in the 6 @-@ minute enclosure .
&quot; all patients were subsequently received for an open @-@ label extension , where they received another 3,5 years ( 182 weeks ) every week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
after 26 weeks of treatment the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients towards the plac@@ ebo group one improvement of the pul@@ mon@@ ial function and the in@@ ability that is shown in the following table .
in the open extension study the improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in der@@ Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me @-@ group and from 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as from the following table works .
the acceptance of the expected FE@@ V is not significant over this period of clin@@ ically not significant and the absolute pul@@ mon@@ o @-@ volume increased proportional to the height of growing children .
&quot; of the 26 patients with an Hep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly prior to treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) until the end of the study has a normal liver size . &quot;
&quot; within the first 4 weeks , a clear waste of the G@@ AG mirror in Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) was observed that remained at the degree course . &quot;
&quot; with regard to hetero@@ gene@@ ous path@@ ogen@@ s between the patients caused by using a combined repository , the clin@@ ically significant changes in the 6 @-@ minute enclosure , circulation of school@@ ing ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration of 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
it was conducted a year @-@ year @-@ 2 @-@ 2 study conducted mainly to the security and pharmac@@ oc@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in 20 patients who were at the time of their intake in the study under 5 years old ( 16 patients with heavy feed form and 4 with the middle dis@@ continued form ) .
&quot; in four patients , dosage was increased due to increased G@@ AG@@ - mirror in har@@ n in week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg . &quot;
&quot; with several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) found a normal mental development rate ( &lt; 2.5 years ) , and all 4 patients with the middle dis@@ continued in@@ feed form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with severe failure to determine only limited or no progress in cog@@ nitive development . &quot;

&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have not been treated before , in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chem@@ otherap@@ ies as well as some treatment . &quot;
&quot; to reduce side effects , patients should take care of patients during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid , as well as tor@@ ic acid ( a vitamin ) and inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
&quot; when A@@ lim@@ ta administered together with cis@@ pl@@ atin , should be used before or after the gift of Cis@@ pl@@ atin in addition to an &quot; anti@@ em@@ e@@ tics &quot; ( medicine against om@@ iting ) and liquids ( to bend a liquid angel ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose blood screen changes or when certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be reduced , set or the dose will be reduced . &quot;
the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed slow@@ ed the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents them to share the cells .
the transformation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed into its active form is easier to equi@@ p in cancer cells than in healthy cells that leads to higher concentr@@ ations of the active form of the drug with a longer active role in cancer cells .
&quot; for the treatment of the mal@@ ign@@ ing Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ oms , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major student in 456 patients who had previously received any chemotherapy against their disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ clever lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were treated in a study on 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disorder that previously had been treated with chemotherapy , with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( a different medicine against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another medicine against cancer ) , and both in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin in a study on 1 725 patients , who had previously received any chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
&quot; patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and cis@@ pl@@ atin continued average of 12.5 months , compared with 9.5 months in all administration of cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; in patients having previously received an chemotherapy , the average survival period with A@@ lim@@ ta 8.@@ 3 months , compared to 7,@@ 9 months in doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; however , in both studies there were patients where cancer does not attack the el@@ ial cells , in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta longer period of survival as with the comparison @-@ media @-@ medicine . &quot;
September 2004 presented the European Commission to the El@@ i Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. a permit for the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
each diar@@ rhe@@ a bottle has to be increased with 4.2 ml 0.@@ 9 % of so@@ dium @-@ injection ( 9 mg / ml ) - what a solution of 25 mg / ml

ALI@@ M@@ TA is in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin indicated for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non@@ recur@@ ring bron@@ ch@@ ial hist@@ ology ( see Section 5.1 ) .
ALI@@ M@@ TA in Mon@@ therapy is displayed for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic non@@ recur@@ ring bron@@ ch@@ ial hist@@ ology ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of body surface ( KO@@ F ) administered as in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous Inf@@ usion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of cis@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as inf@@ usion over a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - Inf@@ usion on the first day every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients with non @-@ fr@@ y bron@@ chi@@ car@@ cin@@ oma , the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F administered as in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous Inf@@ usion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; to the reduction of the frequency and sever@@ ity of hood actions , the day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed gift , as well as the day after the treatment is given a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ ero@@ id . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ holes must be taken at least 5 cans of tor@@ so , while taking the intake must be continued during the entire therapy period and for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose . &quot;
patients also have to obtain an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection injection bone of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g. ) in the week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dose as well as after each third watch cycle .
&quot; in patients , the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed has been created , should be created a complete blood @-@ image in front of each gift , including a differentiation of the leu@@ co@@ cy@@ tes and a th@@ under@@ bo@@ cy@@ ten@@ cen@@ sus . &quot;
the al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ ate gases ( AP ) , A@@ spart@@ at @-@ Tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( A@@ ST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Al@@ anine @-@ Tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( ALT or SG@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 @-@ fold of the upper border value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle a dosage must take place under Ber@@ kl@@ ace of the N@@ adi@@ rs of the blood @-@ image or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity of the predicted therapy .
&quot; after recovery , patients must be treated according to references in tables 1 , 2 and 3 which are used to apply to ALI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity C@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 ble@@ eding .
&quot; should patients no hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ≥ degree 3 develop ( except Nov@@ oto@@ x@@ icity ) , the patient must be interrupted by ALI@@ M@@ TA until the patient has the value before treatment &quot;
the treatment with ALI@@ M@@ TA must be broken when in patients after 2 dos@@ is@@ reduction tox@@ icity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity grade 3 or 4 appearance or so@@ - continued at the appearance of degree 3 or 4 neur@@ oto@@ x@@ icity .
clinical trials are no indication that in patients aged 65 Jah@@ an@@ age or in comparison to patients aged under 65 years an increased by @-@ user risk .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to non @-@ suff@@ iciency of the data for in@@ conceivable and effectiveness .
in clinical studies were necessary for patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min no dosage adjustment necessary to go beyond that for all patients recommended dos@@ is@@ ations .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance of under 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with a liver func@@ tioned by &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - border value and / or tran@@ sam@@ ic values of the upper limit value ( at Ab@@ le Wes@@ tin of Leb@@ an@@ et@@ ast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5,@@ 0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver ast@@ ases ) is not specifically examined in the studies . &quot;
patients must be monitored with regard to the bone mark@@ ings of repression and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must not be administered by patients before their absolute Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ phil@@ ology has again a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ - cy@@ linders again reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
&quot; a dosage reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adir of the absolute Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ phil@@ ology , th@@ under@@ bo@@ cy@@ tic and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity , as they observed in the previous treatment cycles - the ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; a lower tox@@ icity and a reduction of degree 3 / 4 t@@ mat@@ ological tox@@ icity , such as ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ y , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ y and infection with degree 3 / 4 ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ed has occurred , if a pre @-@ treatment with fol@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place . &quot;
&quot; therefore , all patients need to be reli@@ ed on patients with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed patients , follow @-@ acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a proph@@ esi@@ ed measure for reduction @-@ related tox@@ icity . ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to medium kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous intake of non @-@ ster@@ oi@@ dal anti @-@ medicine ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the treatment , the day of therapy and mind@@ set - TE@@ NS 2 days after the therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; all patients , intended for therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed is intended , the intake of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long semi @-@ term treatment for at least 5 days before the treatment , be avoided on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients in which these events occurred , had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre@@ acher hyper@@ tension or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant liquid - accumulation in the trans@@ cell@@ ular space a drainage of the ergometer in front of the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment can be weigh@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; 5 serious cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ din@@ ary , and cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ac events were reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed occasionally , if this ingredient is usually administered in combination with a different cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ical ingredient . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous application atten@@ u@@ zed human beings ( except Gel@@ f@@ fi@@ eber , this vacc@@ ination is con@@ train@@ dic@@ ated ) not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; because the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible sk@@ ill@@ ation of reproductive ability is made by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised in the treatment of treatment - advised advice regarding the sperm activation . &quot;
in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) can high doses of non @-@ ster@@ oi@@ dal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ is@@ tics ( ≥ 1.1 g daily ) to a reduced P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ex@@ cre@@ tion with the result of a more multiplied occurrence of side effects .
therefore caution is advisable when in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or Ac@@ ic@@ t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ acid is applied in high dosage .
&quot; I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ al@@ - acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and mind@@ set - TE@@ NS 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no data regarding the interaction potential than with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long semi @-@ week@@ days like Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or ro@@ fec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application must be avoided with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed for at least 5 days before therapy , the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - mixed . &quot;
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the bar@@ gain status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti @-@ ag@@ ul@@ ant and ant@@ ine@@ oplastics requires an increased surveillance frequency of IN@@ R ( International Standards Association ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti @-@ ag@@ ul@@ ant .
&quot; there are no data for the use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ holes in pregnant , but as with an@@ tim@@ icro@@ bi@@ ites are expected in an application in the pregnancy heavy duty of birth . &quot;
&quot; P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ scher must not be applied during pregnancy , except for a challenge , and after careful selection of use for the mother and risk for the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; because the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible cran@@ ial of reproductive ability is made by p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised before the treatment course , advised advice with regard to the sp@@ inal cord . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed into the mother &apos;s milk , and unwanted effects on the Asc@@ ended baby may not be excluded . &quot;

the probability of occurrence gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal symptoms ( see Section 4.8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken along with a fat @-@ fat or fat diet .
&quot; since the weight reduction in diabetes can proceed with improved met@@ lic control , patients should take a medicine against diabetes , before beginning a therapy with all@@ i a doctor or pharmac@@ ist consult because the dosage of the anti @-@ di@@ abe@@ tic treatment should be appropriate . &quot;
patients who have all@@ i as well as medicines for hyper@@ tension or increased cholesterol levels should consult their physician or pharmac@@ ists whether the dosage of these medicines must be adjusted .
&quot; it is recommended to meet additional oscill@@ ating measures , in order to do this in case of severe Di@@ ar@@ rh@@ ö possible distor@@ tion of the oral contrac@@ eption ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;

the side effects of Or@@ list@@ at are mainly gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal nature and are connected to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug with the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug .
the gast@@ ro@@ om@@ in@@ al side effects were obtained from clinical studies with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporarily .
&quot; the frequencies are defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data not estimated ) . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of the known side effects that were determined by the market launch of Or@@ list@@ at , is not known as these events were voluntarily reported by a population un@@ certain size . &quot;
† It is pl@@ au@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i to cl@@ amps with regard to possible or actual gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal side effects may lead .

&quot; in the majority of cases reported after the launch of reported cases of Or@@ list@@ at @-@ Over@@ dosage , either no side effects or similar side effects were reported by the recommended dose of Or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
&quot; based on investigations on humans and animals can be attributed by a fast rever@@ sibility of system@@ ic effects , which are attributed to the specified characteristics of the list@@ eners . &quot;
the therapeutic effect lies in the lum@@ ens of the stomach and the upper lim@@ n@@ ar bond to the active Ser@@ in @-@ rest of gast@@ ric and pan@@ cre@@ atic lips .
&quot; clinical trials was derived that 60 mg Or@@ list@@ at , three times daily , the absorption of about 25 % of the food fat . &quot;

&quot; the primary parameter , the change of body weight opposite the output value ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ ization ) , has been evaluated as follows : as a change of body weight in the study program , which have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their output weight ( table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although in both studies the weight reduction have been observed by 12 months , the largest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months . &quot;
the average changes in the overall chol@@ est@@ book was with or@@ bit@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( initial value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with plac@@ ebo + 2.7 % ( initial value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .

the most common side effects hang along with the effic@@ acy of the capsules together and thus arise that more fats from the body is cut off .
&quot; these side effects tend to occur within the first few weeks of the course of treatment , because at that time the fat share in the diet might not be reduced consistently . &quot;
&quot; with the following basic rules you can learn to minimize the nutritional defic@@ ien@@ cies and better a week before the first intake of capsules with a fet@@ ched diet . • learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite food , and about the size of the portions that you normally take . &quot;

&quot; Alo@@ xi is applied in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( like cis@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the excessive trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( like Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , D@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of alo@@ xi can be used by adding a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine that can be used as an anti@@ em@@ e@@ tic ) .
&quot; the application in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended , because of the effects in this age group does not exist enough information . &quot;
&quot; this means that the ingredient identifi@@ es the bond of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ Hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ ot@@ onin ) to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi was investigated in three main studies at 1 8@@ 42 adults , the chem@@ otherap@@ ies were received , which are strong and excessive trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , showed 59 % of patients who were treated with alo@@ xi in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 from 223 ) , compared to 57 % of the patients with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron @-@ treated patients ( 126 of 221 ) . &quot;
&quot; in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the excessive trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , showed 81 % of patients who were treated with alo@@ xi in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of the patients with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron treated patients ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values at 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
&quot; March 2005 , the European Commission was granted to the European Commission of Helsinki B@@ rex Pharmac@@ euticals Ltd . a permit for the transport market from Alo@@ xi throughout the European Union . &quot;
Alo@@ xi is indi@@ ces : to prevent cancer prevention and v@@ om@@ iting aid in severe em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer prevention and om@@ iting for moderate chemotherapy according to cancer .
the effectiveness of alo@@ xi for prevention of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting that is in@@ duced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy can be enhanced by adding an before chemotherapy given Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron extend the col@@ dar@@ mp@@ age should pro@@ long patients with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ al Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ tract I@@ le@@ us after injection .
&quot; however , with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , however , caution is advisable with con@@ current gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with drugs that prolon@@ gs the Q@@ T @-@ Inter@@ v@@ all or in patients where the Q@@ t- interval is extended or which ten@@ ds to such an extension . &quot;
&quot; except in connection with other chem@@ otherap@@ eu@@ tics G@@ abe , Alo@@ xi will neither be used in the days after chemotherapy or treatment of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in pre@@ clinical trials , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron does not inhi@@ bit the activity of five under@@ examined chem@@ otherap@@ eu@@ tics not ( Cis@@ pl@@ atin , Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , Cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ in , D@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ omy@@ cin C ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial , no significant pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a unique in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous dose Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady @-@ stat@@ ure concentration , a CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; in a population based on pharmac@@ oc@@ ine@@ tic analysis was shown that the simultaneous transmission of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 in@@ duc@@ tors , chlor@@ ox@@ et@@ tin , Hal@@ ob@@ avi@@ r , Hal@@ ob@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ ox@@ en , Ser@@ tr@@ aline and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; experience regarding the use of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies are not before , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied , unless it is taken from the loose doctor as necessary . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials were the most common in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams to observ@@ ant side effects ( total of 633 patients ) , who stood at least possibly with alo@@ xi in connection , he@@ ada@@ ches ( 9 % ) and Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of over@@ sensitivity and reactions to the appointment ( burning , har@@ dening , complaints and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experiences . &quot;
in group with the highest dosage showed similar skins of undes@@ irable events such as in other doses groups ; there were no dose @-@ active relationships .
&quot; there were no di@@ aly@@ sis studies , due to the large distribution volume , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably no effective therapy in a Alo@@ xi@@ ety . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies were received a total of 1.@@ 132 patients , compared with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cis@@ pl@@ atin , Car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin , car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin ( half @-@ time 4 hours ) or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time 7,@@ 3 hours ) received , that was in day 1 without de@@ x@@ eth@@ ason in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , the total of 667 patients were received a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zin and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zin and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zin , as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , which were given in day 1 in@@ trav@@ en@@ ously . &quot;
results of the studies with moder@@ em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summar@@ ized in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical trials for the indicator in@@ duced chemotherapy and v@@ om@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; after the f@@ aded clinical trial Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron possesses the ability to block in the v@@ entri@@ cular De@@ - and Rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation involved , and extend the duration of the action potential . &quot;
&quot; the objective of the study carried out by 221 healthy Pro@@ b@@ anden study was the assessment of the EC@@ G @-@ Eff@@ ects of i.@@ v. administered Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single @-@ osen of 0,25 , 0.75 . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption After in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous G@@ abe follows an initial decrease of the plasma concentr@@ ations resulting from the body with an average termin@@ al half @-@ time of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the concentr@@ ations of time @-@ curve ( AU@@ C0@@ - ) are generally observed in the whole range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ / kg in Heal@@ thy and cancer victims .
&quot; after in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the average sized ( ± SD ) increase from Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron @-@ Plas@@ mak@@ on@@ cent@@ ation at 42 ± 34 % . &quot;
&quot; from pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations , eman@@ ates that once achieved a daily in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous gift of 0.25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron at 3 consecutive days , however , the C@@ max after the adjustment of 0.75 mg higher . &quot;
&quot; about 40 % will be eliminated over the kid@@ neys , and about another 50 % will be converted into two primary met@@ gers , compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron over less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on 5@@ HT@@ 3 recept@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ studies for met@@ alli@@ zation have shown that CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in low dimensions , the I@@ so@@ enzy@@ me CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 at the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are involved . &quot;
Eli@@ min@@ ation After an in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found around 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ altered active ingredient made about 40 % of given dose . &quot;
after a unique in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous Bol@@ ster@@ ili@@ zation in gh@@ tened the total of 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ ale Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
&quot; although in patients with severe liver processes , the termin@@ ale Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al resistance and the average system@@ ic exposure with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases , a reduction of dose is therefore non @-@ justified . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ clinical trials , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions which are regarded as sufficient over the maximum human therapeutic exposure to a low relevance to the clinical use . &quot;
&quot; 10 Of pre @-@ clinical trials take note of that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block in very high concentration of I@@ on@@ enk@@ channels , who are involved in the v@@ entri@@ cular De@@ - and Rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and extend the action of action . &quot;
&quot; high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose met in approximately the bowl of therapeu@@ tical exposure to people ) who have been given daily over two years , led to a more frequently incidence of liver or@@ chards , end@@ ocr@@ ine Ne@@ oplas@@ tic , p@@ itu@@ itary , pan@@ cre@@ as , secondary school and skin tum@@ ors , but not in mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not completely known , but due to the used high doses and since alo@@ xi is intended for a unique application , the relevance of these results will be low as for the human being . &quot;
the owner of this permit has to inform the European Commission about the plans for the transfer of the drug in the context of this decision to be approved .

&quot; principal indicators of the effic@@ acy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients , whose infection was discounted after the end of the treatment . &quot;
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients under Alt@@ ar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.2 % ) of 71 patients under plac@@ ebo were spoken to treatment .
&quot; in the treatment of infected cells , alt@@ ar@@ go and C@@ efal@@ exin coinci@@ dence : if the results of both studies were taken together in Hau@@ gen , said about 90 % of the patients of both groups on treatment . &quot;
&quot; however , in these two studies , however , alt@@ ar@@ go has been caused in the treatment of fail@@ ures ( well @-@ filled hol@@ low tiles ) or infections that have been caused by MR@@ SA , not effective enough . &quot;
the most common side @-@ effect with Alt@@ ar@@ go ( which was observed during 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation to the order .
&quot; the Committee for Human@@ arz@@ tend ( CH@@ MP ) to conclude that the benefits of alt@@ ar@@ go in the short @-@ scale @-@ treatment of the following super@@ ficial skin infections compared to the risks , • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small la@@ under@@ ations , sh@@ allow@@ ances or se@@ wn w@@ ounds . &quot;
May 2007 presented the European Commission to the Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . a permit for In@@ quiry from Alt@@ ar@@ go to the entire European Union .
patients who show no improvement within two to three days are still being investigated and be considered an alternative therapy ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in the case of sensi@@ tizing or severe local irrit@@ ation by applying ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be the treatment is to be broken , the sal@@ ine is carefully ab@@ sent and an appropriate alternative treatment of infection started . &quot;
ret@@ inal ulin shall not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as path@@ ogen ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical trials in secondary wound , the effectiveness of ret@@ inal ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) were insufficient . &quot;
&quot; an alternative therapy should be considered , if after a 2- to 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected site occurs . &quot;
the effect of simultaneous application of ret@@ inal ulin and other top@@ ical resources on the same skin space has not been studied and the simultaneous application of other top@@ ical medicines is not recommended .
&quot; due to the low plastic de@@ centr@@ ations , which were achieved in humans for top@@ ical application on sh@@ ame@@ ful skin or infected super@@ ficial w@@ ounds , a clin@@ ically relevant fr@@ aming in vi@@ vo is not to be expected ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
3 After con@@ current gift of 2 times daily 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol increased the middle ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin p@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max to top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be on sh@@ ame@@ ful skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
&quot; due to the low system@@ ic exposure to top@@ ical application in patients , dosage adap@@ tations are not required if top@@ ical ret@@ inal ulin is applied during a system@@ ic treatment of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a re@@ produc@@ tion@@ x@@ icity according to oral intake and are insufficient in terms of a statement on the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be applied during pregnancy when a top@@ ical @-@ bacterial therapy is clearly indi@@ ces and the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to attract an system@@ ic antibiotic treatment .
&quot; when deciding whether breast@@ feeding has been continued / termin@@ ates or the therapy with Alt@@ ar@@ go continue to be completed , is between the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the su@@ cking and the benefit of alt@@ ar@@ go therapy for woman . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials in 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections , which are used Alt@@ ar@@ go was the most common inci@@ dents of irrit@@ ation by appointment , which were about 1 % of patients . &quot;
&quot; mode Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ atives of Pl@@ uro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated through Ferm@@ entation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ anus ) . &quot;
the chi@@ pping mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on sel@@ ective inhi@@ bit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding position of the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ oms that differs from the ties of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ ag@@ onal anti@@ bacterial substances .
data point out that the Bind@@ ings of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales protein L3 is involved and is located in the region of ri@@ Bosni@@ om@@ al P @-@ bind@@ ings and the Pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase@@ Centre .
&quot; by connecting to this tie @-@ line inhi@@ bits Pl@@ uro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line the Pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer , blocking partly P @-@ bond interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50@@ s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units . &quot;
&quot; should cause the local pre@@ valence of resistance to the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin , at least some inf@@ ectious forms , should be consult@@ ed by expert advice . &quot;
there were no differences in in @-@ vit@@ ro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us regardless of whether the isolation were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
&quot; in case of non @-@ profit on the treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes should be considered with additional virus factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ one @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults became 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be daily under oc@@ clusi@@ on on intact and de@@ ported skin for up to 7 days .
&quot; from 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , the 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days for the top@@ ical treatment of secondary injury w@@ ounds , individual plastic map@@ ro@@ bes were obtained . &quot;
the sampling took place on the days 3 or 4 at the adult patients before studying and in children between 0 @-@ 12 hours following the last application .
&quot; however , the maximum individual system@@ ic reception of the people after top@@ ical application of 1 % Sal@@ be on 200 c@@ m2 de@@ ed skin ( C@@ max = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 n@@ g · h / ml ) 660 @-@ times lower than the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP in@@ hibition . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is used for protection against hep@@ atitis A and hep@@ atitis B ( diseases which affect the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years that are not yet imm@@ un against these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix will be applied within two doses of existing vacc@@ ines with a protection against hep@@ atitis B may only be achieved after administration of the second dose .
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used when immun@@ ization has a low risk of hep@@ atitis B infection and is assured that which can be guided out of two doses existing vacc@@ ination . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her dose against hep@@ atitis A or B is desired , Ambi@@ rix or another hep@@ atitis C or -@@ B vaccine can be given . &quot;
vacc@@ ines work by bringing the immune system ( the natural def@@ ences of the body ) as it can defend itself against a disease .
&quot; after having received a child the vaccine , the immune system recogni@@ zes the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; foreign &quot; and generates antibodies against it . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix has the same components as the approved vaccine Twin@@ rix adults and who has been approved since 1997 with Twin@@ rix children since 1997 .
&quot; the three vacc@@ ines will be applied to the protection against the same diseases , however , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children have administered within three doses of existing vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults include identical ingredients , some of the data that apply the application of Twin@@ rix adults , also considered evidence of the use of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main inde@@ er for the effectiveness was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a month after the last injection of antibodies .
&quot; in an additional study with 208 children , the effectiveness of the vaccine were compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two inj@@ ections . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix lead in between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection on the development of protective antibodies against hep@@ atitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection from Ambi@@ rix on a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month distance between inj@@ ections was similar .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vacc@@ ines ) are he@@ ada@@ che , appeti@@ te , appeti@@ te , pain on the inj@@ ections , red@@ ness , Mat@@ ure ( tired@@ ness ) as well as friction . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix may not be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients to one of the other components or Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) not to be applied .
August 2002 presented the European Commission to the Gla@@ x@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ icals s.@@ a. a permit for the transport of Ambi@@ rix in the entire
the stand@@ ardis@@ ed plan for the Grun@@ di@@ m@@ ori@@ tizing with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines which is the first dose in the appointment of the election and the second dose of six to twelve months after the first dosage administered .
&quot; if a refres@@ her is required for hep@@ atitis A as well as for hep@@ atitis B , it can be vacc@@ inated with appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ kal@@ ine vacc@@ ines or with a combined vacc@@ ination . &quot;
the anti @-@ hep@@ atitis with a combined anti @-@ hep@@ atitis ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ hep@@ atitis @-@ A @-@ virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) -@@ antibodies are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ kal@@ ine vacc@@ ines .
&quot; it is not yet fully backed whether or most competent persons who have addressed to a hep@@ atitis C vacc@@ ination , a refres@@ her vacc@@ ination as a protection , as they are also protected by the immun@@ o@@ ge@@ ological memory . &quot;
3 How in all inj@@ ections should be liable for the rare case of an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ ac@@ tic reaction after the gift of the vaccine appropriate options for medical treatment and supervision always immediately available .
&quot; if a fast protection against hep@@ atitis B is required , the stand@@ ardis@@ ation scheme is recommended with the combination of hep@@ atitis B , the 360 ELISA units formal hep@@ atitis C @-@ A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B surface . &quot;
&quot; in case of di@@ lu@@ ent patient and persons with disturb@@ ances of the immune system , under circumstances the anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS @-@ anti@@ body is achieved , so in these cases the gift of further vacc@@ ines may be required . &quot;
&quot; because an in@@ tra@@ oc@@ ular injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration could lead to a substantial imp@@ ending success , these inj@@ ections should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; in the case of Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ top@@ en@@ ie or blood dis@@ rup@@ tions , Ambi@@ rix can occur subtle to sub@@ cut@@ aneous , since it can occur in these cases according to in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular gases coming to blood . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix in the second life @-@ year in the form of a separate injection , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ular Per@@ t@@ us@@ i@@ tis@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us c@@ act@@ us type b @-@ vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with a combined Mas@@ ern@@ - M@@ umps @-@ tube was administered , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was adequate ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
patients suffering from immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune def@@ ective needs to be assumed that possibly not enough immune response will be achieved .
&quot; in a clinical trial , the incidence of pain@@ s , red@@ ness , sw@@ elling , mat@@ ernity , gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ i@@ tis , he@@ ada@@ ches and f@@ ever comparable with the frequency that was observed in the earlier Thi@@ om@@ ers@@ al@@ - and preser@@ v@@ atives . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ inated Ambi@@ rix were administered in a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to 15 years . &quot;
&quot; in a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 to 15 , the compatibility of ambi@@ tion was compared with the 3 @-@ cans combined . &quot;
only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and soft@@ ness on a comp@@ uted basis per vacc@@ ination ambi@@ tion . however not on a comp@@ uted basis per person .
&quot; it was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0,@@ 7 % of the Pro@@ b@@ anden compared with 39,@@ 1 % during the gift of a dose of 3 @-@ doses . &quot;
&quot; after the complete vacc@@ ination reported 6@@ 6,@@ 4 % of the Pro@@ b@@ anden , the Ambi@@ rix had been administered , about pain , compared to 6@@ 3.6 % of the promot@@ ers who were vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dosage adjustment . &quot;
&quot; however , the frequency of mat@@ ence was per Pro@@ band comparable ( d. h. across the whole vacc@@ ination at 39,@@ 6 % of the promot@@ er@@ anden , compared with 36,@@ 2 % of the promot@@ ers who received the 3 @-@ cans of combin@@ ant . &quot;
the frequency of pronounced pain@@ s and soft@@ ness was low and comparable to which is observed after administration of the combination of combination with the 3 @-@ cans vaccine .
&quot; in a compar@@ ative study on the 1 @-@ 11 years of immigration , the appearance of local actions and general transactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ Group is comparable with 360 ELISA units , combined with 360 ELISA units and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ able Hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ able hep@@ atitis B surface area . &quot;
&quot; however , at the 6@@ - until 11@@ - year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination , a common appearance of pain ( on the inj@@ ections ) per dose , not per Pro@@ band , reported . &quot;
&quot; the proportion of immigration , which reported on serious side effects during the 2 @-@ cans vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ cans vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units de@@ activated hep@@ atitis C @-@ A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ able hep@@ atitis C , was not statisti@@ cally different . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials , which were conducted in Im@@ migrants at the age of 1 to 15 years , the serv@@ o drives for anti @-@ H@@ AV 99@@ ,@@ 1 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 administered dose ( d. h. in month 7 ) . &quot;
the Ser@@ ok@@ on@@ ver@@ sion@@ trains for anti @-@ H@@ BS were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , ending the month 6 administered dose ( d. h. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; 7 In a compar@@ ative study , which was carried out at 12@@ - until including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combination tr@@ apped with three doses . &quot;
&quot; for the 289 persons , their immun@@ ity was valuable , the Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ary bet@@ ra@@ yed ( SP in the table below ) against hep@@ atitis B in the month 2 and 6 after G@@ abe of the 3 @-@ dosage process , it significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; the immune response , which were achieved in a clinical comparison with 1 @-@ 11 year @-@ olds , one month after ending the full vaccine ( i.e. , in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
in both studies the Im@@ plants were either a 2 @-@ cans vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ cans vaccine with a combined hep@@ atitis C @-@ 1 virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ able Hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ able hep@@ atitis B surface .
&quot; at persons who were at the time of the pri@@ ori@@ tis@@ ation between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS has been proven for at least 24 months after the immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ months vacc@@ ination . &quot;
&quot; the immun@@ ity in this study was comparable to both anti@@ gens was comparable to vacc@@ ination of 3 doses , consisting of 360 ELISA units , consisting of 360 ELISA units , combined with a combination of hep@@ atitis B and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ able hep@@ atitis B surface in a dosage volume of 0.5 ml . &quot;
in a clinical trial at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies in the 0 @-@ 6@@ - months vacc@@ ination is comparable to that in the 0 @-@ 12 @-@ month vacc@@ ination .
&quot; if the first dose ambi@@ tion was at the same time with the refres@@ her di@@ lig@@ ent , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , in@@ activ@@ ating gen@@ om@@ yel@@ i@@ tis@@ - and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us vacc@@ ines ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with the first dose of a combined mas@@ quer@@ ors ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with the first dose of a combined mas@@ quer@@ or vacc@@ ines , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was adequate . &quot;
&quot; a clinical study , performed with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults , showed for the current formulation of similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ors and Ser@@ ok@@ on@@ ver@@ sion@@ ists like the former formulation . &quot;

as with all vacc@@ ines Ambi@@ rix not fully protect against infection with hep@@ atitis C or hep@@ atitis B virus even if the complete vacc@@ ination has been completed with 2 cans .
if you are infected / your child before the administration of both vacc@@ in@@ ants Ambi@@ rix are already infected with hep@@ atitis C or hep@@ atitis B virus ( although you / your child may not feel uncomfortable or sick ) can prevent vacc@@ ination a disease may not prevent .
protection against other infections that cause the liver damag@@ ing or symptoms which are similar to those after a hep@@ atitis C or hep@@ atitis B infection cannot be convey@@ ed .
• If you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine including Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can express itself by ju@@ ck@@ skin irrit@@ ation , breathing not or sw@@ elling of the face or tongue . • if you have performed an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hep@@ atitis A or Hepatitis B. if you have / her child a severe infection with f@@ ever . &quot;
• If you need to quickly have protection against hep@@ atitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the used administration of the second vacc@@ ines ) .
at a possible risk of infection with hep@@ atitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination the doctor will advise you / your child of a vaccine with Ambi@@ rix .
&quot; instead , he will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hep@@ atitis B vaccine with a reduced enclosure of an effective component ( 360 ELISA units of a formal hep@@ atitis C @-@ A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B ) . &quot;
the second vacc@@ ines of this vaccine with decreased content of an effective component is usually administered by a month after the first dose and might give you a vaccine before the end of the vaccine .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix will suffer from individuals who suffer from severe blood @-@ minded people under the skin and not into the muscle tissue . • If you are weak@@ ened / your child due to illness or treatment in your / his body &apos;s resistance .
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases but the immune response of these persons on the vaccine may not be adequate so that a blood test can be required to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is .

&quot; but it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient , and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hep@@ atitis A and B viruses . &quot;
&quot; if another vaccine has to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated at separate places and as many different limb@@ s . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix is expected at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lo@@ bul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine is still adequate . &quot;
&quot; usually , Ambi@@ rix pregnant or nurs@@ ing women is not administered unless there is an urgent need to vacc@@ inated against hep@@ atitis A and hep@@ atitis B . &quot;
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .

&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps was approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; because of the rar@@ ity of the disease at the time of admission only limited information on this medicine . &quot;
the use is indigenous to all patients where a complete enzy@@ mes already mani@@ f@@ ests during the first 28 life @-@ days ) .
&quot; in patients with a delay in a delay in patients with a delay , there is a indication of the use if in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese there is a hyper@@ hy@@ ly@@ rical flower . &quot;
&quot; for inf@@ ants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing the AM@@ MONA@@ PS is also available in granite form . &quot;
the daily dose is individually calculated assum@@ ing the protein @-@ toler@@ ance and of the necessary daily prot@@ ections of the patient .
&quot; according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as with growing and adults . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from an early mani@@ pulation lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ats@@ yn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ au@@ scar@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase , is the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ ir@@ lin or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0,@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,@@ 8 g / m ² / day required . &quot;
patients with an ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ et@@ ase @-@ lack must ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.7 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8,@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MONA@@ PS tablets may not administered patients suffering from Schl@@ u@@ ck@@ trou@@ bles , as a risk to the emergence of Ö@@ soph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ zer@@ a , when the tablets do not immediately reach the stomach . &quot;
&quot; each tablet AM@@ MONA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per 20 g so@@ dium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ ate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
AM@@ MONA@@ PS should therefore be used in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney failure and with so@@ dium @-@ depth clinical conditions with caution .
&quot; since Met@@ abol@@ isation and secre@@ tion of so@@ dium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ yr@@ ate over the liver and the kid@@ neys , AM@@ MONA@@ PS should be applied in patients with liver or kidney failure . &quot;
the importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore con@@ train@@ dic@@ ally ( see 4.3 ) .
with sub@@ cut@@ aneous gases from phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats ( 190 - 474 mg / kg ) it came to a slow@@ ing of neur@@ onal multip@@ lication and to a gest@@ ing loss of neur@@ ons .
it also found a consuming matur@@ ation of cer@@ eb@@ r@@ al syn@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ished number of functioning thr@@ ill in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
&quot; it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is sign@@ posted in the mother &apos;s milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS during the l@@ ac@@ tation period is con@@ train@@ dic@@ ated ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials in clinical trials with AM@@ MONA@@ PS came at 56 % of patients at least an unwanted event ( AE ) , and at 78 % of this undes@@ irable events has gone out that they were not associated with AM@@ MONA@@ PS . &quot;
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year old an@@ ore@@ tical patient which developed a met@@ ab@@ i@@ tis in conjunction with lack@@ tat@@ azi@@ ce , heavy Hy@@ po@@ kal@@ ine , Panz@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ie , periph@@ er@@ ge@@ tic Neurop@@ athy and pan@@ cre@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of over@@ dosage stood at a 5 month old inf@@ ant with a fail@@ ing single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day a dos@@ is@@ up@@ tive neur@@ oto@@ x@@ icity .
Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabo@@ lic active connection made by ac@@ ut@@ amine with gl@@ ut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine con@@ ju@@ amine that is made by the kid@@ neys .
P@@ öch@@ i@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally saw phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine with urea comparable ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carriers on the capture of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with mal@@ functions of the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed that for each gram refers so@@ dium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ yr@@ ate between 0.8 and 0.15 g Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine nitrogen nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is at an early stage and the treatment is immediately started to improve the survival chances and the clinical outcome .
the progn@@ osis of the earliest symptoms of the disease with appearance of the first symptoms in new age of age was almost always inf@@ ant and the disease led itself in the treatment with Per@@ it@@ one@@ al@@ di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their sti@@ cking @-@ free an@@ alogues within the first quarter of life .
&quot; by her@@ di@@ aly@@ sis , the utilization of alternative path@@ ogen@@ ous membrane ( so@@ dium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ ed , so@@ dium and potentially sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of New@@ bor@@ al ( however within the first life @-@ month ) of diagnosed diseases on 80 % . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even with these patients it came with the time with many to mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ resistant form of the disease ( including feminine patients with hetero@@ gene@@ ous spongiform encephalopath@@ y , and then permanently treated with Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and a prot@@ ein@@ ated diet , the survival rate was 98 % . &quot;
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible for treatment and in some patients may occur a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition .
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is placed in liver and kidney enz@@ ym@@ atic with gl@@ ut@@ amine con@@ ju@@ ut@@ amine , whereby phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine is created . &quot;
the concentr@@ ations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and its met@@ abo@@ lic in plasma and urine have been determined by so@@ aring healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary lif@@ ec@@ ycle of course as well as repeated gifts of oral cans of up to 20 g / day ( non @-@ controlled studies ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and its met@@ abo@@ lic was also examined in cancer patients following in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous gift of so@@ dium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ yr@@ ate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after a oral single dose of 5 g so@@ dium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ yr@@ ate in tablet form were taken 15 minutes after taking measurable plastic surgery of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate .
&quot; in the majority of patients with fluores@@ cent cycli@@ c disorders or hem@@ og@@ glo@@ bin@@ oc@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) next morning to next morning , no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in plasma rep@@ utable . &quot;
&quot; with three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were repeatedly treated with so@@ dium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ yr@@ ate ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the middle phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate con@@ cent@@ ric noise in plasma cutting on the third day than after the first gifts . &quot;
shr@@ ink@@ age The medication is made within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of consecutive product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine via the kid@@ neys sign@@ posted .
according to the results of Mic@@ ron@@ y@@ cle@@ us tests had so@@ dium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ yr@@ ate with toxic and non @-@ toxic cans treated no cl@@ ast@@ ogen@@ ous effects ( investigation 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) .
&quot; AM@@ MONA@@ PS Gran@@ ul@@ at will either be taken or@@ ally ( inf@@ ants and children , who can not swal@@ low no tablets , or patients with swal@@ low dis@@ rup@@ tions ) or via a Gast@@ ro st@@ ack@@ et or a n@@ as@@ ens@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ yr@@ ate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for new@@ bor@@ ns , inf@@ ants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as with growing and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammonia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( in particular , bran@@ ched acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um@@ prot@@ one in plasma should be kept within the normal range . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from an early mani@@ pulation lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ats@@ yn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ au@@ scar@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase , is the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ ir@@ lin or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0,@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,@@ 8 g / m ² / day required . &quot;
AM@@ MONA@@ PS Gran@@ ules per gram contains 124 mg ( 5.5 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per gram of so@@ dium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ yr@@ ate according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per 20 g so@@ dium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ ate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
if rec@@ tan@@ gles before the birth phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active Met@@ abo@@ lit by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ) were exposed to l@@ esi@@ ons in the pyramid cells of sh@@ ep@@ herds .
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year old an@@ ore@@ tical patient which developed a met@@ ab@@ i@@ tis in conjunction with lack@@ tat@@ azi@@ ce , heavy Hy@@ po@@ kal@@ ine , Panz@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ie , periph@@ er@@ ge@@ tic Neurop@@ athy and pan@@ cre@@ atitis . &quot;
P@@ öch@@ i@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally saw phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine with urea comparable ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative support for the outlet of excess .
on the basis of investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ ting of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed that for each gram refers so@@ dium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ yr@@ ate between 0.8 and 0.15 g Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine nitrogen nitrogen .

after a oral single dose of 5 g so@@ dium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ yr@@ ate in gran@@ ules form 15 minutes after taking measurable plastic surgery of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate .
&quot; during the duration of durability , the patient can store the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of over 25 ° C . &quot;
with this procedure the small mess@@ engers is 0.95 g of the average mess@@ engers 2,@@ 9 g and the large measuring on 8,@@ 6 g so@@ dium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ yr@@ ate .
&quot; if a patient has to receive the medication via a probe , AM@@ MONA@@ PS can also be dis@@ solved in water ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of so@@ dium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ yr@@ ate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases are lacking certain liver enzy@@ mes , so that they accumul@@ ate the sti@@ ck@@ eting waste products that can be used after consumption of proteins in the body . &quot;
&quot; if you are made with you laboratory exam@@ inations , you must notify the doctor that you may have AM@@ MONA@@ PS , since Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate can affect the results of certain laboratory exam@@ inations . &quot;

&quot; during the l@@ ac@@ tation period , you must not take AM@@ MONA@@ PS as the medicine could move into the mother &apos;s milk and hurt your baby . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases also Tur@@ tle , he@@ ada@@ che , flav@@ ouring , dis@@ rup@@ tions of obe@@ di@@ ence , dis@@ orientation , memory dis@@ rup@@ tions and a deterioration of existing neuro@@ logical states are observed . &quot;
&quot; if you encounter one of these symptoms , please contact your doctor or using your health care provider for the treatment of appropriate treatment . &quot;

&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox is used for the treatment of adult patients with &quot; ac@@ ute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood access to the heart ) , for example in inst@@ abil@@ er Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in breast cancer with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ din@@ ary ( heart attack ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ din@@ ation ( cardi@@ ac h@@ olog@@ ram or EC@@ G ) . &quot;
&quot; an@@ gi@@ ox to prevent blood cells in patients to be applied to a PCI , becoming a higher dose and the inf@@ usion can continue up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can contribute in patients with Ang@@ ina or heart attack for the maintenance of blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; nearly 14 000 patients took part in the main study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of an@@ gi@@ ox at all@@ some genes , or in combination with a Gly@@ kop@@ ter @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( G@@ PI , a different medicines to prevent bloo@@ d@@ ules ) with conventional combined treatment of hep@@ atitis ( another anti @-@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI compared . &quot;
&quot; during the PCI patients often have a st@@ ent ( a short tube , that remains in the ar@@ tery to prevent a fast@@ ener ) , and they received additionally other medicines for preventing blood pressure , such as ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and aspir@@ in . &quot;
the treatment of ACS was an@@ gi@@ ox - with or without gift of G@@ PI - with the prevention of new events ( deaths ; cardi@@ op@@ ies or Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation ) after 30 days or one year as effectively as traditional treatment .
&quot; in patients who subjected to one PCI , an@@ gi@@ ox in terms of all indicators was just as effective as Hep@@ arin , except for heavy blood vessels , where it was significantly more effective than Hep@@ arin . &quot;
An@@ gi@@ ox may not be used in patients who possibly hy@@ pers@@ ensi@@ tive ( allergic ) against Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine , other brain @-@ dine or one of the other components . &quot;
&quot; it must also not be used in patients who had recently had a blood , as well as with people with strong hyper@@ tension or serious kidney problems or a heart@@ infection . &quot;
the Committee for Human@@ arz@@ tend ( CH@@ MP ) contributed to the conclusion that an@@ gi@@ ox in the treatment of ACS and during a PCI a acceptable replacement for Hep@@ arin is .
September 2004 presented the European Commission of the Medic@@ ines The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd a permit for inclusion of an@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with ac@@ ute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lever ) with a emergency access or if an early intervention is provided .
the recommended initi@@ al@@ dose of an@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous Bol@@ us@@ ation of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an inf@@ usion of 0,25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if the patient is performed in another episode , an additional bolt / kg should be given by 0,5 mg / kg and the inf@@ usion for the duration of the operation on 1,75 mg / kg / h increases . &quot;
after the PCI may be taken to clinical requirements the reduced inf@@ usion of 0,25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours .
&quot; immediately before the procedure should be administered by 0,5 mg / kg , followed by an inf@@ usion of 1,75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the Rhin@@ op@@ last@@ y . &quot;
the recommended dosage of an@@ gi@@ ox in patients with one PCI consists of a initi@@ alizing in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous Bol@@ us@@ ation of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and an in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous inf@@ usion with a dose of 1,75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the operation .
the safety and effectiveness of a sole bol@@ us of an@@ gi@@ ox was not investigated and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
&quot; if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) runs under 225 seconds , a second shaft should be made of 0,@@ 3 mg / kg / body weight . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the appearance lower ACT values , the re@@ constitu@@ ent and dil@@ uted medicine should be carefully mixed before use and the Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis is rapidly administered . &quot;
&quot; once the ACT amounts to more than 225 seconds , a further monitoring is no longer required , provided the 1,75 mg / kg inf@@ usion of inf@@ usion is correct . &quot;
&quot; in patients with medium @-@ sized kidney function ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are treated to one PCI ( whether with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din against ACS or not ) , a lower inf@@ usion rate of 1,@@ 4 mg / kg / h should be used . &quot;
&quot; lies the ACT value below 225 seconds , is a second Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis of 0,@@ 3 mg / kg to admini@@ ster and the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney injury , included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( replace @-@ 2 ) , which resulted in the ACT value 5 minutes after adding the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ Bol@@ us without dosage adjustment on average 366 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
3 For patients with severe kidney injury ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients is An@@ gi@@ ox con@@ train@@ dic@@ ally ( see under Section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with an@@ gi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after ending the in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous gift of un@@ frac@@ tory hep@@ atitis or 8 hours after completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous genes of lower hep@@ atitis .
• well @-@ known hy@@ pers@@ ensi@@ tivity to the active ingredient or other components or elevated blood risk . • severe un@@ controlled hyper@@ tension and subtle bacterial infections . • severe kidney injury ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients have been carefully insp@@ ected during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of blood flow especially if Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine is administered in combination with another anti @-@ ag@@ ul@@ ant . ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; even if at PCI @-@ patients under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine will occur in patients who can occur in patients who occur a per@@ k@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) , while treating the treatment in principle anywhere . &quot;
&quot; in patients , the War@@ far@@ ine are treated and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , should consider the value of the IN@@ R @-@ Wer@@ ts ( International Standards Association ) , to ensure that the value after gradu@@ ation treatment is achieved before the treatment &apos;s existing level . &quot;

&quot; in combination of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine with Th@@ is@@ bo@@ zy@@ g@@ ag@@ ulation , or anti@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ al parameters are regularly monitored on a regular basis . &quot;
&quot; the animal testing investigations are regarding effect on the pregnancy , the embryonic development , the binding , or the post@@ nat@@ al development insufficient ( see under Section 5.3 ) . &quot;

&quot; Ap@@ i@@ dra is used for the treatment of adults , young people and children from six years with diabetes which require treatment with ins@@ ulin . &quot;
&quot; Ap@@ i@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ ted ( under the skin ) into the ab@@ dom@@ inal wall , the th@@ igh@@ s or the upper arm , or as continuous inf@@ usion with an ins@@ ulin pump . &quot;
diabetes is a disease where the body does not have sufficient ins@@ ulin to control the gl@@ uc@@ es@@ pi@@ o ( sugar ) in the blood or the ins@@ ulin cannot process effectively .
In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in differs very slightly from human @-@ ins@@ ulin and the change means that it works faster and a shorter period of action has as a short @-@ effective human @-@ ins@@ ulin .
&quot; Ap@@ i@@ dra was used in combination with a long @-@ effective ins@@ ulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , where the body is no ins@@ ulin , in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years . &quot;
&quot; in type @-@ 2 @-@ diabetes , in which the body ins@@ ulin does not work effectively , Ap@@ i@@ dra was studied in a study with 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
&quot; the main inde@@ er for the effic@@ acy was the change of concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ ly hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bal ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood , which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
&quot; in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes , after six months a reduction of 0,@@ 14 % ( from 7.3 % to 7,@@ 46 % ) compared to a reduction of 0.7 % of ins@@ ulin resistance . &quot;
in adults with type @-@ 2 @-@ diabetes the reduction of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration 67 % after six months with Ap@@ i@@ dra in comparison to 4.2 % of human@@ ly ins@@ ulin .
&quot; Ap@@ i@@ dra may not be used in patients that may be overweight ( allergic ) against ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or one of the other components , or in patients suffering from an an@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
the doses of Ap@@ i@@ dra may possibly be adjusted when it is administered together with a number of other medicines which can affect the bloo@@ d@@ glu@@ ing level .
September 2004 presented the European Commission of San@@ o@@ fi @-@ A@@ venti@@ s Germany GmbH approval for In@@ quiry by Ap@@ i@@ dra in the whole of the European Union .
&quot; Ap@@ i@@ dra is as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , either in the area of the ab@@ dom@@ eter , the Ober@@ sch@@ enk@@ els or the dolph@@ ins using continuous inf@@ usion in the area of the ab@@ dom@@ en @-@ sacks . &quot;
due to the reduced Glu@@ kon@@ os@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and the reduced ins@@ ulin use of patients with a restriction of liver function .
&quot; any change of the active thickness , the mark ( Her@@ - actors ) , the In@@ sul@@ in@@ yp@@ s ( normal , N@@ PH , galvan@@ izing ) , the type of ins@@ ulin ( animal ins@@ ulin ) and / or the manufacturer method can change a change of ins@@ ulin resistance . &quot;
&quot; 3 A inadequate dosage or the break@@ age of a treatment , in particular in patients with a ins@@ ul@@ ent diabetes , may result in a hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and a di@@ abe@@ tic c@@ eto@@ azi@@ ce ; these conditions are potentially vital @-@ threat@@ ening . &quot;
the conversion of a patient to another ins@@ ulin type or ins@@ ulin of a different manufacturer should take place under strict physician supervision and can make a change of dosage .
the time of occurrence of a hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the active profile of the used ins@@ ulin resistance and can therefore change from the conversion of the treatment plant .
&quot; among the substances which can increase blood sugar levels and increase the incl@@ ination to Hy@@ po@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic , Fi@@ br@@ ate , Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , mon@@ o@@ amin @-@ O@@ xi@@ da@@ se ( MA@@ O ) -@@ Hem@@ mer , Pent@@ oxi@@ di@@ yll@@ in , Pro@@ po@@ xy@@ pha , S@@ aliz@@ yl@@ ate and Sul@@ fon@@ et@@ antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , under the effect of Symp@@ ath@@ ol@@ y@@ tika like Bet@@ ab@@ lock@@ ers , Cl@@ oni@@ din , Gu@@ an@@ eth@@ id@@ in and Reserve the symptoms of in@@ ep@@ hr@@ enia can be isolated or missing . &quot;
&quot; animal testing studies have no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and Human@@ ins@@ ulin in relation to pregnancy , the embryonic development , the birth or the post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine enters into the human mother &apos;s milk , but generally the ins@@ ulin passes either into the mother &apos;s milk , nor is it res@@ or@@ ated after oral application . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the clinical trials of clinical studies are listed , group@@ ed by system organs ( very often : ≥ 1 / 10 ; often : ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on availability ) . &quot;
&quot; cold @-@ speaking , fres@@ hness and bl@@ asse skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or weakness , confusion , concentration , concentration , cop@@ ious , changes in the se@@ ag@@ eness , he@@ ada@@ ches , nau@@ sea , nau@@ sea , nau@@ sea , nau@@ sea . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy Wir@@ d failed to change the inj@@ ections within the inj@@ ections , can occur in a sequence a Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy to the inj@@ ections . &quot;
heavy Hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ vities with awareness can be given by an in@@ tra @-@ mus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of gl@@ uc@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) which is treated by a corresponding person or by in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous gift of gl@@ uc@@ ose by a doctor .
&quot; after a gl@@ uc@@ tance of the patient , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the urine thing for the heavy Hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and avoid similar episodes . &quot;
ins@@ ulin lowers the blood sugar level by stim@@ ulating the periph@@ eral gl@@ uc@@ ose intake ( especially through sk@@ elet@@ al muscles and fat ) as well as by the im@@ itation of gl@@ uc@@ ose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that if sub@@ cut@@ aneous cro@@ ach@@ ments occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ em normal ins@@ ulin .
&quot; in a study involving 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 @-@ diabetes melan@@ chol@@ t , ins@@ ulin resistance from 0,@@ 0@@ 75 to 0,15 E / kg showed a dis@@ proportion@@ ate increase of glu@@ ing effect , just like human @-@ ins@@ ulin . &quot;
In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has a double as fast as a normal human body and achiev@@ es the complete glu@@ ing effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human ins@@ ulin .
&quot; from the data it was clear that in an application of ins@@ ulin p@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal , a comparable post@@ p@@ ran@@ al gly@@ cem@@ ic control is achieved like with human@@ ized regular ins@@ ulin , which is 30 minutes before meal . &quot;
&quot; In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal , has been given a better post@@ p@@ ran@@ al control than with human@@ em normal ins@@ ulin that has been given 2 minutes before meal . &quot;
&quot; In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control as in human normal ins@@ ulin , which is given 2 Mi@@ - nu@@ ten before meal ( see picture 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at G@@ abe 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - previously ) before the start of the meal in comparison with human@@ ized regular ulin , which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min ) before the meal ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min ) before the meal ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( figure 1@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at G@@ abe 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - down@@ wards ) after the beginning of the meal in comparison to humanitarian Nor@@ - mal@@ ins@@ ulin , which was 2 minutes before the meal ( figure 1@@ C ) before the beginning of the meal ( figure 1@@ C ) . &quot;
