<seg id="6">Abilify is used for the treatment of severe to severe manoepisodes and prevention of manic episodes in patients who have addressed past medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">Injection solution is used for rapid control of undisturbed unrest or behavioural disorders if the orale intake of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both diseases, the solution to take, or the melting tablettes in patients may be applied to those the swallow of tablets difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in patients who are being able to take different medicines, the same as Abilify, the dose of Abilify needs to be adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this affects the signal transmission between brain cells by" neurotransmitters, i.e. chemical substances that enable communication of nerve cells. "</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazol probably works mainly as a "partieller Agonist" for the receptors of neurotransmitters Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also Serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripiprazol like 5-Hydroxytryptamin and Dopamine, but in less than the neurotransmitters has an effect to activate the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"since Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin is a role to play Aripiprazol to normalize the activity of the brain, causing psychotic or manic symptoms and it will occur."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the effectiveness of Abilify, to prevent the re-occur symptoms, was investigated in three studies of up to one year."</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies at 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases which sled at stamped unrest over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study, Abilify over twelve weeks to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the effectiveness of Abilify and placebo, to prevent recovery in 160 patients where the manic symptoms were already stabilized with Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study on 301 patients with bipolar disorder that shouted by Lorazepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies, the change in symptoms experienced by patients based on a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who spoke on treatment."</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also led studies to investigate how the body relieve the melting tablettes and the solution to initiate (recorded).</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the two studies with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses from 5.5 mg, 75 mg or 15 mg, a significant stronger reduction in symptoms haunted unrest than the patients who received a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">In the application the treatment of bipolar disorder decreased Abilify in four of the five short-term studies manic symptoms effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify prevented by up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo the re-occur of manic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was additionally administered to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses have also slightly more effective than placebo the symptoms stamped unrest and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side-effects of Abilify for disposable (observed during 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidale disorders (continuous movement), axspepsia (constipation), vasspation (constipation), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleeping disorders) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Humanarztend (CHMP) contributed to the conclusion that the benefits of Abiliophrenia and medium-heavy to severe manic episodes in the treatment of schizophrenia and the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mainly manic episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazol assumptions in relation to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">"in addition, the committee came up to the result that the benefits of injection solution in the rapid control of gestures unrest and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes at Bipolar-I disorder, if a oral therapy is not suitable to weigh the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">June 2004 presented the European Commission to the Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a permit for the transport of Abilify in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of the Bipolar I- disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mainly manic episodes and their manic episodes on treatment with Aripiprazol Anse (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at a discount ddose of 15 mg / day once daily independent of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">An increased effectiveness in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">"the recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combined therapy (see Section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">"with regard to the larger sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initiate dose should be considered if clinical factors to justify this (see Section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">"if the CYP3A4-inductor is set off from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the appearance of suicide's behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders, and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after the change of an antipsychotic therapy, also in treatment with Aripiprazol (see Section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="36">"results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder, there was no increasing number of suicide risks with Aripiprazol compared to other antipsychotic medicines."</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazol should be used with caution in patients with well-known cardiac diseases (myocardinal disease or ischic hereditary diseases), cereal prevention, treatment with bleeding medicines) or hypertension (including akzelerated and Maligne form).</seg>
<seg id="38">"3 Spätdyskinesia: in clinical trials, one year or less digestible, there were occasional reports over during treatment with Aripiprazol."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if at one with ABILIFY treated patients signs and symptoms of a late dyskinesthesia, should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="40">"when a patient proofs and symptoms that pointed to a mns, or impedingly high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotic medication, including ABILIFY, must be abandoned."</seg>
<seg id="41">"therefore Aripiprazol should be used in patients with varicopies in the Anamnese or in states, which are applied with caution with caution."</seg>

<seg id="47">"a weight gain is generally observed in schizophrined patients and in patients with bipolar Manie, using antipsychotic medicines, which is known as a side-effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle, and could lead to severe complications."</seg>
<seg id="48">"due to the primary effect of Aripipzol to the central nervous system, caution is advisable when Aripipzol is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective medicines such as sedation (see Section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the H2 Antagonist Famotidin, a magnet acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripipzol, whereby this effect is not relevant as a clinically not relevant."</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical trial with healthy doctoral students increased a highly effective CYP2D6-Inhibitor (Chinidine) the AUC by Aripiprazol by 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">"it is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, like fluoxetine and paroxetine, similar effects have and therefore should be made similar dosissions."</seg>
<seg id="52">With CYP2D6 'poor' (= 'poor') Metabolism can result the joint application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma-centrations from Aripiprazol resulting in comparison to CYP2D6 extensive Metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="53">"if you consider the common genes of Ketoconazol or other highly effective CYP3A4-Inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential use of potential risks to the patient should prevail."</seg>
<seg id="54">"other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazol and HIV-Proteasonhibitors, are likely to have similar effects and therefore should be done similar dosissions."</seg>
<seg id="55">After placing the CYP2D6- or 3A4-Inhibitors the dosage of ABILIFY should be lifted to the Dosishops before the beginning of the companion therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with ABILIFY can be administered with a moderate increase in the Aripipelzol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials shown doses from 10-30 mg Aripiprazol per day does not have significant effect on the Metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextromethmorphan / 3-methodology), 2C19 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (Dextrough phic). "</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or pregnant during the treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="59">"due to the insufficient data situation for the safety of people and due to those in reproduction studies, this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy, unless the potential benefits are made clearly the potential risk for the fetus."</seg>
<seg id="60">"however, in other antipsychotic medicines, patients must be warned that dangerous machines, including power vehicles, to use until they are sure that Aripiprazol has no negative influence on them."</seg>
