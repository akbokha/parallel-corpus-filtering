&quot; if a part of the text is selected , only this part is located at the place of the entire &amp; URL ; &quot;
machine translation are only very ru@@ di@@ mentary . Bab@@ el@@ fish produces the best case a rough translation and in worst case non@@ sense . therefore , the translations should not be dependent on the translations without the translation previously . &quot;
&quot; only web pages on the internet can be translated . other texts should be translated into the Bab@@ el@@ fish page itself , where you can put into cap@@ turing texts directly . &quot;
package &amp; package ; contains various modules for &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size they provide some extra features and simplify the use of some features of &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; by which they are easier available .
further information about using &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual on &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ;
to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; select Settings Add your settings .... open the box card and select the desired modules .
this is a list of standard setup modules from the package k@@ de ; Add@@ ons . please note that any more modules are installed on your system if you have additional software installed .
&quot; you should install the package base , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains , before you compile this package . &quot;
&quot; to use the crash module , click in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to cr@@ ashing , or the list of cr@@ ashes , if available , delete . &quot;
the module An@@ sel@@ ects ( also folder filters ) you can reach in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under extras . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s current working directory on different types .
&quot; to use the DO@@ M Building in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or , to view extr@@ as DO@@ M tree ... and thus open a new window with the DO@@ M of the document , example : docum@@ ent@@ ment , all the other no@@ des are sub@@ elements of this root st@@ ables . &quot;
the module &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; presents a further view of objects with the M@@ IME @-@ Type I@@ node / directory in local files . it can be used as an alternative for the various symbols and text views to ensure the content of your local file system .
&quot; the peculi@@ arity of &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; consists in it , war@@ dly Ord@@ n@@ erh@@ ier@@ arch@@ ies with the help of a so called Tree @-@ map graph@@ ically . Tree @-@ Maps permit the display of size of objects in spar@@ ed structures . each object must be proportion@@ ate to its size . this size must possess the sum that the sum of the size of the sub@@ ordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object . &quot;
&quot; at &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; it reflects the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the items in it . thus , large files , even then can be easily recognized as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; -@@ command can be seen . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; an entry in the tre@@ mor @-@ representation is a rec@@ t@@ angle that represents a file or folder in your fil@@ es@@ ystem . for easier navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles feature meaningful colour and labelling settings . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rec@@ t@@ angle , which is switched on display mode , can either be depth for the slight detection of the casing or the figure of a different type of file like name , owner , group or m@@ ime @-@ type . &quot;
a rec@@ t@@ angle can be displayed with the various properties of the appropriate file or folder . for each feature you can specify if sufficient space to display is available or whether the area of sub@@ ordin@@ ate law@@ ns is to appear . in addition you can specify the relative position of the marking in the rec@@ t@@ angle .
&quot; with the possible algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps , the area should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . if this goal is not always respected . please note that less space will be lost for the frame when the rec@@ t@@ angle square is square . &quot;
&quot; like division of the surface of an entry for the sub@@ ordin@@ ate entry is made , the implementation is left to leave . here , it is possible for the coated and avoiding wild@@ card so that rec@@ tan@@ gles arise that square meters are created . the best methods in this respect are lines , columns or recur@@ sive c@@ utter@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; you can specify the minimal space for an entry over the menu entry view at a surface area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the super@@ ordin@@ ate entry , to indicate that this area is actually covered by a sub@@ ordin@@ ate entry . &quot;
originally &amp; F@@ S@@ View was originally designed &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; as a small review and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets which was developed for the application of K@@ C@@ ach@@ egr@@ ind .
the picture gallery can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under extras @-@ gallery ... or with C@@ trl ; I .
&quot; if you call the module picture gallery , it opens a dialog with which you can define the appearance of the gallery . &quot;
the option title of the site allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery .
the option pictures per line has a sli@@ der and a turning field to set the number of thumb@@ nails of each line in the gallery .

&quot; a simple to use camera interface is provided to you , so that you can connect to your digital camera and support your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ tization . of course , every medium and every card reader is supported by your operating system , using &amp; digi@@ tization . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D came ; contains a fast image processing with basic imaging tools . you can use it to review your photos , comment , to evaluate and correct . the processing capabilities can be easily expanded with KDE Image plugins Interface ( manual ) modules . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; digi@@ ous , it &apos;s easy to use ; it puts a du@@ sting professional skills . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit colour and all available modules support the rough handling by means of li@@ bra@@ w , DN@@ G @-@ Export and ICC Administrator . &quot;
&quot; improved database with significantly more metad@@ ata , such as &amp; eg ; about the camera or the lens , which can be looked for . &quot;
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ ous ; an open source project . this means it is dependent on the support of the end users . they should therefore report problems and improvement .
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ous ; attempts to make use of problems or improvements as easy as possible for them . whenever you use these links , the Help menu opens a page with a underlined connection . all required information is already registered here . follow the instructions to send your message . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D came ; is a project that is supported by a community . i.e. , the user and developers came to each other . if you &apos;d like to answer any questions about other users . in this mailing list , we would like to answer any questions of other users . in this mailing list , you should be quite powerful to this language . &quot;
you can also visit the digi@@ tization ; homepage to visit the news about shared versions and other information about &amp; Pres@@ ents ;
&quot; the best start to participate in &amp; digi@@ tization , is the registration in the developer @-@ mailing list . instructions for registration in the developer @-@ mail list of &amp; digi@@ tization . &quot;
&quot; when you arrived &amp; digi@@ ous ; for the first time you are asked , you will be asked where you can store your images and your database . you can simply enter a local , remote or remote folder . enter a folder name or click the folder icon to select a folder . &quot;
&quot; in the second box , you must specify a local folder on your computer . here the data file will be stored . this path remains the same for all image folder . &quot;
&quot; later , you can add as many folder as you would like to add . &amp; digi@@ ous ; will you use additionally as Al@@ ben@@ library . settings digi@@ tization Coll@@ ections &quot;
&quot; if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder that includes images as basic folders . &amp; digi@@ tization . no picture will be changed as an album . no picture will be changed . during the check of the folder you will see a progress indication like this : &quot;
&amp; digi@@ ous ; were looking for recur@@ sively the libr@@ ation in its entire depth . you can not add sub@@ folders unless it arrived in the hidden folder . this allows you to insert it in the hidden folder . this allows you to insert a point before the name of the sub@@ folder .
&quot; if you take a existing folder with photos as basic folders , you will notice that the albums are in My Al@@ ben@@ list , do not take photos as symbols . you can change the photo by clicking on the folder symbol . further details can be found in the section albums . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the base folder you can set up in &amp; digi@@ ous ; your digital camera setup . after that , you should learn how to use My albums and cra@@ em@@ ony to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; resource support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , so you can use it ; possibly this support is based on the li@@ brown library . if you want to find out whether a special camera is supported , so you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the menu help of Roh@@ k@@ amer@@ a@@ suppor@@ tive . &quot;
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections of Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ settings and Ro@@ h work@@ flows .
&quot; a simple to use camera interface is provided to you , so that you can connect to your digital camera and support your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ tization . of course , every medium and every card reader is supported by your operating system , using &amp; digi@@ tization . &quot;
modern digital cameras are connected by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer . the camera will then be implemented as a turn@@ able device ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras can also use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&quot; &amp; D came ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 to communicate with digital cameras , a constantly increasing number of over 800 cameras supported . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely spread protocol , which was developed by the International Imaging Industry Association without the need for additional drivers . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos in general are large files and transmission through the serial port slowly , this connection is already obsol@@ ete . &amp; digi@@ tization also supports these cameras and introduces the transmission of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras will be found under this link . &quot;
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be created with purple support to be read and can be read by some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 camera channels . if the P@@ 50@@ s support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you will never eat anything or the generating could be very slow . &quot;
one of the most beautiful things in &amp; digi@@ tization is how easy to extend its functionality by modules :
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules : the KDE Image plugin interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module for &amp; digi@@ ous , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the aim is to provide the modules on all video programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way as it can also be a user . your advantage is that it &apos;s much easier to supplement &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; by writing a small module to complement one function than the changes in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; they perform itself .
to simplify the window you can either remove the side with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or change in full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ trl + Shift + F .
&quot; the drag and drop of pictures works everywhere : you can drop a picture in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ bau@@ ms , over the horizontal partition line or into a different use window . the only limitation is not in key@@ word , file list or search . &quot;
&quot; - a data selection allows you to raise the most common , JP@@ EG , PN@@ G , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ d , movies and audio &quot;
the text filter is used only for the fields that are currently displayed in the toolbar . so the filtering is displayed on the fil@@ en@@ ames only if it is displayed in the dialog box . which fields are displayed in the dialog of the Al@@ ben@@ ign settings .
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view of your photo gallery . these albums are saved according to folders , where they were created on the hard disk , according to the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ properties or after the date , on which the album was first created to be sorted . the date can be changed in the properties of the album . &quot;
&quot; if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . you can also add a screenshot directly to an album . select album import@@ ing the screenshot . &quot;
&quot; to move a picture from an album to another one or move it , you can move the photo with the mouse on the target album and drop it . you can move on the same way several pictures or copy it . simply select all photos and move it onto the target album . &quot;
&quot; an album contains a collection of photos and the album properties , allowing you to include information about this collection . to click on the album properties , you must click on the album click on the album and edit the menu features . &quot;
&quot; Alb@@ um@@ - Coll@@ ections : are a method to highlight your albums , so that you can be group@@ ed under a common name , using a collection from the toolbar or view albums by collection . if you want to add new collections or delete , you can do this in the settings for coll@@ ections . &quot;
the Alb@@ um@@ - Date : is used when you sort your albums by date with view albums by date .
&quot; buttons El@@ test@@ er , average , neu@@ ester : these place the date on the one of the oldest , the new image or the passage of the album . this will first try to calculate the pictures from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , instead the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder . &quot;
&quot; when you first entered an album &amp; D , the first image is chosen as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this will help you remember the photos in the album . sometimes , the first picture in the album is not representative , and you want to select another photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , you have to click the picture with the right mouse button and click in the context menu &amp; quot ; As you select the photo on the album in the list to put it as a symbol . &quot;
an album can always be included in a collection and can not be scre@@ ened .
&amp; D came ; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the area M@@ one key@@ word list left below in the main window . album collections are always all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
&quot; the screen window will provide you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images are displayed in this album in the image window . each photo will be shown in a preview , you can customize the size of this preview with the two lou@@ pe buttons in the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; when you open an album the first time you &apos;ll be short waiting , while the thumb@@ nails will be generated . this can avoid you , in which you can create new thumb@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; information on each image will be shown below the corresponding preview . what information this is , you can change over settings digi@@ tization . select here the albums page and adjust the thumb@@ nails your wishes . &quot;
the thumb@@ nails have a look . if you can rest the mouse cursor to a moment of a picture . the screenshot shows the main features including all the keywords of a picture . the screenshot above in the section introduction into the main window shows such a help window .
photos are all about what it comes to &amp; digi@@ tization . albums and keywords allow you to organize your images to work as it suits you . the image editing displays your photos and allows you to reach a number of improvements over the menu or menu image menu . you have the choice between the included pictures , a slideshow or the editing of images . &quot;
you can open the image editing with a photo by clicking either F@@ 4 image editing ... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and edit ... please find a guide on how to edit your photos . using the image processing you can view your photos and change it .
&quot; it may occur that &amp; digi@@ ous ; the functionality that you need is not available , allowing you to open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu navigation , and how you can customize these your needs when your program will not en@@ umer@@ ated , you will find information in the &amp; k@@ de ; manual . &quot;
&quot; you should be aware that it cannot be used after processing other image editing programs with the related metad@@ ata . some programs do not save this data with the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture , etc . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ ous ; provides two ways of rotation . the simpl@@ est is to click the mouse button on the thumb@@ nails and select turning . in the sub @-@ menu you can indicate the degree of rotation .
&quot; to change the fil@@ en@@ ames of a photo , you can click on the thumb@@ nails and select F2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you retain the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; if you came a photo from &amp; digi@@ bin ; delete , it will be moved to the M@@ ül@@ lei@@ mer of &amp; k@@ de ; remove it . f@@ 8 images deleted or Ent@@ f Falls you prefer really Delete , you can use this by removing Shift ; Ent@@ f . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My dat@@ um@@ sli@@ p@@ quot ; organiz@@ es your photos based on the data . &amp; digi@@ ous ; used for this either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of last change in the file . &quot;
&quot; select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in dates below in data sheet , so that you can only show the photos of the selected days . &quot;
photos with key@@ word provided provides flexible and powerful opportunity to organize your photos and cat@@ alog@@ ously . tags are sti@@ ckers to address the individual photos or whole groups . as soon as a key@@ word can be assigned a photo you can find the photo by selecting this key@@ word or search .
&quot; if a key@@ word is selected , all photos , which were marked with this key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . thereby , you can create your keywords log@@ ically . you can also set parts of the tree &amp; quot ; they can also set parts of the tree &amp; quot ; , so you can find the keywords that you are looking for . &quot;
&quot; the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and proven key@@ word in the IP@@ TC data fields of image , at least for JP@@ EG . in addition , the keywords in loss of the database re @-@ imported as soon as &amp; digi@@ ous ; the images noticed . &quot;
&quot; you can add new keywords by clicking with the right mouse button either on &amp; quot ; Share , or to an existing key@@ word . if you have a new key@@ word , after you click on an existing key@@ word , it becomes the sub@@ password of this key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; you can delete a key@@ word by clicking the key@@ word with the right mouse button and delete . if you delete a key@@ word , the photo itself is not deleted from this photo . &quot;
you can change the position of a key@@ word by drag it to the desired position in the tree and then drop a menu that gives you the possibility to push the key@@ word . a key@@ word can only be in the tree at a time .
&quot; you can edit the properties of a key@@ word by clicking it with the right mouse button , and in the context menu key@@ word . you can edit the name of the key@@ word and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , you need to select the image with the right mouse button and select in the context menu As Alb@@ um@@ vor@@ Review . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to put it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; digi@@ ous ; s functionality must handle key@@ word , you first have to pass the photos with key@@ word . alternatively you can click on the corresponding key@@ word in the tree &amp; quot ; alternatively , you can also click the corresponding key@@ word in the tree &amp; quot ; alternatively you can also select with the right mouse button on the thumb@@ nails and select from the context menu key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; you can choose a photo with any number of keywords . the photo will be displayed , once you choose one key@@ word for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event , where it was made etc . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided a photo with key@@ word , this will be shown under the preview of the picture in the main window . &quot;
&quot; you can remove a key@@ word , in which you can open the picture menu of the photo and select from the keywords Menu Rem@@ ove . the menu shows you only the tags , which were assigned to the photo . &quot;
the tim@@ eline view shows a time @-@ dependent Hist@@ olog@@ ram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved on this hist@@ og@@ ram . to select a timeframe . this will all be displayed in the main window in the main window .
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . it then appears in the list below .
&quot; cover all elements of the database : names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , dates and in the future even more . &quot;
Neb@@ ing he searches is a small lamp the green is when the search hits is found . if you click here the filtering is deleted and all images found again . if the search is not found then the lamp will be red .
the advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side bar with the bin@@ oc@@ ulars . if you can open this search a simple search box as described above . you can always filter this search here as a live search . after you have saved as a search criterion . after you have saved Filter in the list .
&quot; if you are happy with your selection , push the head OK and the search is done . the results will be displayed in My search list in the main window , you only need to select the corresponding entry from the view My search list and select an option in his context menu . &quot;
&quot; if you want to edit it , the form for input the search returns again with the previously specified search information . if you choose an advanced search , the dialog box will be available for the advanced search . you will find more rules for searching for . further information can be found in the section The tool for Advanced search . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select the menu menu item . &quot;
the advanced search gives you an exten@@ dable search form available with many search parameters available with which you arrived in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sers ; s database search .
&quot; the list of the search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Alb@@ stadt bank . all rules will be added manually , by operators . each option can be linked with others about the logical operations All ... , One ... , No ... or Minimum 2 ... connect . moreover , you can create addi@@ ction of the type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; &quot;
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed every image characterized by a long number with a special technique that compar@@ es it images by compar@@ ing these signat@@ ures . the lower the difference between two sc@@ apes , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot;
&quot; similar entries : this is an area where you can drop the results . by means of a sw@@ elling , the results can be enlarged or re@@ bo@@ unded . if you move a picture of anywhere over the symbol of un@@ precise search in the left side@@ bar , then these will open up and you can drop it there . &quot;
sk@@ etch : free sk@@ etch @-@ color sk@@ etch : draw a fast sk@@ etch and &amp; digi@@ ous ; find the matching pictures . also here can be a pig value .
this tab represents an intuitive card @-@ tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can click with the mouse wheel or click or move it . move it within the left mouse button . all the images within these coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . this requires naturally the your pictures ge@@ o @-@ data included .
in the field below you can specify a name for your Ge@@ o filters . this will then be added to a later use of the list below . he works like a Live Geo@@ folder .
&amp; digi@@ ie ; provides a lumin@@ ous in a separate window available with which you can simply compare images . he works with all supported image file formats , also raw files . &quot;
choose one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl ; L D@@ em light@@ table add from the context menu . the selection will be added to the context menu . if you are back in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; the main window you can open the lumin@@ ous quickly with L extras .
&quot; from the thumb@@ bar you can drag the pictures you want to see in the left or right area of the window and place there . a small arrow displays you to what copy in which window area can be displayed , then those on the other image will also be carried out . you can then compare the same area of the two pictures . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to quickly create from a picture series , then the left mouse button will automatically be loaded into the ranges on the left . you will now use the left mouse button to display it in the left side . this will be shown in the right area . this simpli@@ fies it through a number of similar images . &quot;
&quot; of course , the normal sol@@ dering actions also work directly from the lumin@@ ous like ... F@@ 4 file editing .... &quot;
all image information from the right side bar of the main window are available for both thumb@@ nails in the lumin@@ ous . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
&quot; in the bottom of each sector you will find a built @-@ in swing function , which you can click on the crossed paths to detect the visible area of the image , you need to click them and the &amp; L@@ MB ; pressed . in the mode preview , both pictures show the same image area . &quot;
the zo@@ oming works as much as in other views . simply use the zoom regul@@ ator under the images or C@@ trl ; mouse @-@ wheel to zoom into the image and out to zo@@ oming . this happens in both images when you preview the mode .
&quot; what is a digital survey management - away from the de@@ word ? digital inventory , every part of the process follows after the picture has been taken up to the final issue and permanent storage . each of the photos saves , sc@@ ans or digital photos saves a form of digital inventory administration . but most of us do not make this in a systematic and efficient way . &quot;
&quot; we give you a tool to secure a plan and practical tips on how to secure your pictures , we will protect and use photos . we look at the procedure for digital photographs the &amp; digi@@ tization . we look at the procedures for digital photographs the &amp; digi@@ tization . we consider downloading , backup , vali@@ dated , ex@@ ch@@ eted , archiving , waiting , wait and ex@@ porting image files . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Digit@@ ale component administration takes on , indi@@ ces , categorized , sec@@ ures , trans@@ duc@@ ted , conf@@ ection@@ ate , conf@@ ection@@ ate and exports content to a mon@@ eti@@ ary or cultural value hab@@ s.@@ quot ; &quot;

&quot; I d@@ are to claim if you don &apos;t know more than 1,000 photos on your computer , then you need not even know how many photos you have . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have to save very fast search and a safe archiving to access you with other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you do and need to know before you have to be organised in your system , the building information structure in contrast to the data structure . you need to decide whether others want to store them on a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc ; pay attention to a larger drive at some point . &quot;
&quot; maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly about your memory location , for you were in one year several times at the same place . the remaining photos will be made using your date . then you will use sub@@ folders like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; use . export is then a folder for images you print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have different requirements like e.g. ver@@ sion@@ ing the photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant immigration of images to different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % Archive and 5 % work@@ flows will not be re@@ organised for this content . &quot;
which types of files fit together ? the separation of data types makes the st@@ ack@@ able processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are searching for an original or a deriv@@ ative picture .
&quot; we also recommend the option metad@@ ata in the setup page of metad@@ ata in &amp; digi@@ tization ; this ensures that Ex@@ i@@ f@@ - and IP@@ TC data will be written in the file , then you can select the metad@@ ata from the database to the files by selecting the appropriate item in the menu . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change ? this puts a metad@@ ata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones . &quot;
&quot; now the real work begins , as you should now choose any photo key@@ word , let@@ tering and an evaluation . of course , you can choose the same attri@@ bute and select the value then . you start the best with the rating or the rank . this makes sense as you can concentrate on the best photos at the best photos . &quot;
&quot; let us now move with key@@ word , key@@ word , like you are frequently called by other programs or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
if you import cat@@ alog@@ ous pictures from a different source with embedded key@@ word . then the tree will fit into the right place . the um@@ et@@ le of Hier@@ archy within the tree is not a problem and can simply be done by drag@@ ging a sub @-@ tree to another . the changed keywords are removed from &amp; digi@@ ous while it persec@@ uted the under@@ trees .
the graphic shows how different metad@@ ata is connected . this is a very rough representation since every block of metad@@ ata in truth consists of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ame and calendar data of all images .
&quot; enough of the key@@ word - the next section relates to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to cat@@ alog@@ ing your metad@@ ata . &quot;
&quot; you want most nobody to see your photos just , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . you are sure to be interested in your photos . &quot;
&quot; look at this panorama . from the distance it is not even a nice beach panorama . if you look at it closer , then you start to see some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; and now I say to you this the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Normandie 60 years after the landing is . Wow ! you start to dream , memories , the historical time period is again present , you may even hear the silence . the circum@@ scription has changed your perception of this panoramic position . &quot;
&quot; for others who view your photos , the title may be more important than the picture itself to create an interest . if you have images , you should tell a story . think of the key it is the importance to viewer to understand Him about the mot@@ if you are moving to understand what you understand . &quot;
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a circum@@ scription for itself alone .
&quot; with &amp; digi@@ ous , you can export as much text , in an internation@@ alization alpha@@ bet ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , as compl@@ ac@@ tion@@ ist . KDE can even export it for a selection of pictures at the same time . KDE introduces you for a selection of pictures at the same time . KDE will present you the story for a selection of pictures in the lab@@ eling and / or the title of Web @-@ Gal@@ eri@@ es@@ ystem . &quot;
&quot; remember the days before GPS ? as you had to find out into another city without navigation system ? well , it was not a boring planet before Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the move of the spatial presentation is now already with light@@ speed . &quot;
&quot; the possibilities of Ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ alization are already un@@ tam@@ able and will be able to open again in the future . I can also export the photos at the recording place . you can also export the images to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flick@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Goo@@ gle@@ Maps Viewer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Copy@@ left is a word game with copyright and means the practice to use copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same freedoms apply also in all changed versions , so also for the work of others . &quot;
the following description tells you what information in the furniture page of &amp; digi@@ arrived ; as information depos@@ ited should be depos@@ ited :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for Er@@ steller and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who has created the photo , e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer , then the name of a company or organisation may not be changed . this field does not support compression nor sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on as separ@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for ver@@ b line ) : associated with the author . examples of this field contains the work designation of photographer , freelance photographer or Independent commercial photographer . as this is a note to the author &apos;s field , this field must be filled out . &quot;
&quot; Editor ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider &apos;s provider to identify who this photo does not necessarily be the author , then these organizations can be listed here , then the group / agency is listed here , then the group / Agency offers the image here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although this has no protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calcul@@ ators . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos only of small interest . for professionals and semi @-@ pros this protection is very important to this . &quot;
the digital wat@@ erm@@ ar@@ ks has a picture unique . &amp; digi@@ ous ; in the near future we provide such a module for st@@ ack@@ able processing .
&quot; topics : PL@@ AT@@ TEN@@ FE@@ H@@ LER , turn@@ outs , currents , ECC , transmission errors , ag@@ eing the storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , des@@ ks , age @-@ time , data size , spread su@@ pers@@ ti@@ tions &quot;
of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that are lost on the road or a fire . these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you with traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section we are about problems with the so @-@ called New Media .
&quot; rolling On@@ track , the largest data recovery company in the world , has some interesting statistics which causes a backup loss . &quot;
to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs to fight this cau@@ tious and one can no longer keep CDs and DVDs in archive quality . of course you can claim CDs and DVDs in archive quality . there are offers over gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece which claim a lifetime of 100 years for himself . whether you believe that is in your jud@@ g@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can use this risk in which you can use good dis@@ ks and good performances , but you cannot write much more reliable . it turns into account the right . &quot;
&quot; CDs and DVDs are very sus@@ cep@@ tible to error , even if you have just been written . about 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for form@@ atting and control environment . despite this massive protection , it is required for form@@ atting and the control environment . despite this massive protection , it is required for form@@ atting and ultr@@ avi@@ olet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; for def@@ ective CDs and DVDs there is a favorable program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that seems to have some miracle for CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux , but is still not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged disks of damaged disks , HDDs , Flash@@ back , USB drives , etc . &quot;
op@@ tic media : Blu @-@ ray dis@@ ks seem to win the For@@ mat@@ War against the HD DVD . a dual layer Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50 GB and therefore almost six sm@@ al the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all which was said to CDs and DVDs are of course also valid for Blu @-@ ray disc .
&quot; then burn slow with a good fee on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ated format . read the media with a description , date &amp; author marks , and then on a clean , dark dry and before animals protected place store . do not forget the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can be read this media . &quot;
Disk@@ Manufactur@@ ers retain your statistics for yourself . your production @-@ makers include a new disk but not the data . Google presents a large field study about the fail@@ ures of hard disks : dis@@ errors
&quot; shortly : dis@@ ks keep up the longest if you are operated in the temperature range of 35 ° C to 45 ° C . at lower temper@@ ament , the fault can not determine the most frequent failure . these are in particular re@@ ef@@ ici@@ ans and publishing house . the anticipated life @-@ time period is between 4 and 5 years . &quot;
&quot; this is only the most complete loss due to over@@ tension . of course , you can also have data loss due to an black@@ out before you have the files secured , but these losses can normally be established without major problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electrical devices does not make much attention during most electrical devices and high @-@ speed processors , that can cause serious harm . on your computer these an@@ om@@ alies can cause heavy data loss , hardware alter@@ ation , destroyed Mother@@ boards and other defects . protect yourself from the un@@ avoi@@ dable that leads to a loss of time and money . &quot;
the most common protection against electricity tips is a over @-@ voltage protection . this is a device that is part of the energy slots absor@@ bs and the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in bar . do not remember that any plug @-@ in bar also contains an over@@ load protection .
&quot; if you are looking for an over@@ load protection , then you should consider that he meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also pay attention to the protection against flash envel@@ ope and thus protects the properly connected devices . &quot;
&quot; since an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should be sure that even all the periph@@ er@@ als that are connected to your system . some manufacturers present a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connectivity options for the co@@ ax@@ ial cable of the cable mo@@ dem@@ s and the television card . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , then you will need a portable over@@ load protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks and therefore also contain the protection for the modem . so you are ideal for travelling . &quot;
&quot; during a period of tension your system will be used in front of smaller variations in the power lines , it will not really help you to change the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a down@@ break @-@ free power supply . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the protection against over@@ stres@@ ses , these devices can automatically save cordless energy when it comes to electricity . if you need an US@@ V then you should be sure that they comply with the same quality requirements like a over@@ load protection . in addition , the lifetime of the battery and the attached software is interesting . &quot;
&quot; concerns the potential risk that your computer system is exposed and compare its safety at electricity disorders , you can get up to &amp; euro ; 20 costs , An 500@@ W US@@ V allows you to consider how well your computer will protect you . at the end you should always think all of the cable before you drive to the holidays . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web Service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can use it as a drive under &amp; Linux , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as a backup target for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer to store any amount of data . &quot;
&quot; they are very expensive compared to the HDDs . however , very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you must send the data about the compar@@ atively slow Internet . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the solutions are suitable only as a solution against a local loss of most important pictures . it is not a poor solution , but it is not a general backup solution . this is too slow . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flick@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are available on photos . their free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not have your images in full resolution online . the professional variant will not be available in full resolution online . for 25 $ a year you get un@@ restricted storage , which should be checked in reality . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of the data backup , the web solutions are very safe . transmission errors are automatically adjusted and with the large companies it is included in the offer a backup and a di@@ visible storage . this is why they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ sure . &quot;
the diagram illustr@@ ates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer . all transmis@@ sions are pr@@ one to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs put at least the data integr@@ ity between operating system and hard disk .
&quot; the worst thing is that nobody says when a transmission errors occurred , not if this happened in your hardware . all these disorders are un@@ noticed until you have no protection in your computer . no one seems to have been thought about it . nobody seems to have thought about it . however , the internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data away than that in your computer . &quot;
&quot; un@@ reliable network components are another source of transmission belts , since they generate inter@@ fer@@ encing inside the data streams . in normal fil@@ es@@ ystems these errors remain un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are currently not especially affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already 2010 you will see thousands of errors a year . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ FS from Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates on lower level and can be highly scal@@ able . it is open source , with many patents and Leopard available . we can only hope that it is soon also available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English . &quot;
Oracle has started its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . this is still in alpha status . it uses the same protective mechanism that is used for Z@@ FS and is also available for &amp; Linux ; it is still not part of the kernel .
under@@ estimate this not ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss at the not@@ ebook and 46 % for the workplace systems . in not@@ ebooks already the share of the theft is 50 % .
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than most serious matters . it leads to a lower damage , such as rob@@ ber@@ ing or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users know only very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; it has been no longer sigh@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less pr@@ one to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NTFS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to call the widespread file systems . a very good English article can be found here . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : false , only the speed of the exploration process during a surgery is higher and an un@@ defined status will be avoided . if however , a file was not completely saved before the problem appeared , it is lost . &quot;
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : false , theft and human error are the main reasons for data loss . &quot;
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 Bl@@ en@@ den@@ ial settings from fundamental physical borders . it is that the technology is further developed there is a natural border for this progress . sensitivity and rob@@ ber@@ y characteristics for all kinds of light @-@ sensors are no longer distant from that limit .
today &apos;s cameras go in the direction of 10 meg@@ api@@ x@@ el@@ sensors . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and high quality optics is the Optim@@ um for compact cameras . even DSLR cameras have your border with 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ xel . for higher resolutions you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
a 750@@ GB hard disk drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not get any other responsible for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are frequently affected by a plan and test this backup before you feel anything like the re@@ install of your operating system to the exchange of plates or the size change of hard disks .
&quot; suppose you make daily your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a light@@ ning bolt you will be lucky if the drive was not connected to the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster proposes locally and destroyed a lot . forget aircraft , fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous for your data . they usually concern a whole room or complete house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , des@@ ast@@ er@@ prevention is always a local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs into the neighboring house , into your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above is a common reason for a backup loss , despite secure the panic loss . if you have a backup which is not immediately available , then you can save one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files are to be secured . it is a snapshot of a story without history and presents a complete copy at a time .
differentiation of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup has been changed . generates a complete snapshot of two periods : the complete backup and the last differentiation .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files have been changed since the last backup . it creates several times . you can restore the original status at any time again . this backup comes with a ver@@ sion@@ ing system in the next with the exception that it is just dism@@ is@@ sed and not continuously .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that can easily set up on your machines . in contrast to script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts . this will be comp@@ ressed and if you want to increase security about ss@@ h .
backup key images directly after you have stored on your computer to DVD or another op@@ tic medium .
&quot; this approach lets you discover enough time to restore losses and restore . at the same time you come for backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of working files . at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for a month and a snapshot for each month . each additional di@@ lu@@ tion should be done manually after which you have made a complete review . &quot;
&quot; topics : metad@@ ata , in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ locate images and metad@@ ata , copy of images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , refl@@ ections , ... , use of the Internet . &quot;
&quot; so that valuable images will survive the next 40 year that is about the time period in which you are really interested in you , because they remember your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be observed : &quot;
&quot; as the future is un@@ predic@@ table because of your nature , you must look at all today with caution and re @-@ evaluate every 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask yourself like the current system back@@ wards compatible . the less variations you have used in the past , the more easier it is to assess the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered by the statements made in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
&quot; virtu@@ alization is nowadays available for everyone . if you &apos;re an old system that is important for reading your images , then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and visual technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the expert print for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means more and more .
let &apos;s proceed from that you have planned the scal@@ ability and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated record or partition . at * ni@@ x systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and transfer it to a new record :
&quot; check with the command dm@@ ie , whether your new record is recognized by the system , but do not hang it . &quot;
&amp; dollar ; dd / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; part@@ ed re@@ size / dev / s@@ d@@ c / 16 ; 32 and travel FS / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of Reiser@@ FS if necessary
&quot; open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day does not find any software anymore , then you can create those yourself . this task will make it easier for year to year . &quot;
&quot; GI@@ F is a proprietary , patented format that dis@@ appears slowly from the market . you should therefore no longer use it . &quot;
&quot; PN@@ G has been developed as an open source standard developed by GI@@ F . however , X@@ MP , ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metad@@ ata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and complete transparency . PN@@ G may need as many administrative information , but not as many as TI@@ FF need and a slow expression . this format we would like to recommend you to saving your pictures . &quot;
TI@@ FF was widely used as image format . TI@@ FF can be saved in un@@ comp@@ ressed form or in a container with a lu@@ cid free compression sal@@ es@@ . a problem is that this format is adapted by many people . there is therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
DN@@ G The Digit@@ ale neg@@ atives file format is a licensed product @-@ format that has been developed by Adobe Systems . DN@@ G has been developed by Adobe Systems . DN@@ G has been developed at the TI@@ FF / EP format and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon .
&quot; this is possibly one of the reasons why in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ forms ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a combination of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; saved for XML / R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers will draw it in the original format of your recording , usually to archive . X@@ MP will fit , since there are the metad@@ ata separately from the image file , but you should consider any problems in the link between the metad@@ at@@ ery and the image file , so you should consider whether you use DN@@ G as a container and put it together . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization responsible for fully compatible online metad@@ ata standards , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI Work@@ groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a far @-@ reaching acceptance of metad@@ ata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . so long the pictures are on the camera edi@@ um , you can use this as a temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to DN@@ G and save it in your raw archive . this function is not implemented yet .
&quot; for a multi @-@ lay@@ ered processing , you can use external programs . if you edit the pictures again with &amp; digi@@ ous , then you should add the metad@@ ata once again and these were cut from the other programs . &quot;
&quot; protect the edited paintings for copyright with a digital wat@@ ermark . export them to Web@@ gal@@ eries , en@@ coding in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ tization . in the section Ad@@ ding an photos to an album you can add , but the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for import@@ ing images to your album bank . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ tization , connect these with the machine , turn the camera on the display mode and turn it . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when you start the camera interface , it tries to connect to your camera . if this is the case , a skill indicator is available at the bottom and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera will be displayed . some cameras will be displayed , the fil@@ en@@ ame and a symbol for the file assignment for each file , photos , movies , music etc. on the camera . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information about each entry . with the page features and metad@@ ata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or metad@@ ata . &quot;
&quot; this dialog shows file properties and photo information that can be stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the picture has not been downloaded to your computer . note that in some digital cameras do not provide all information . &quot;
&quot; the tab Metad@@ ata shows the internal metad@@ ata , such as P@@ 50@@ , manufacturer , GPS etc . this information is the same as in the metad@@ ata page from the main window &amp; digi@@ tization ; or the image processing . note that these metad@@ ata are not available at some digital cameras . &quot;
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button to download and then download the selection of all . this loads the photos completely deleted and we recommend you to check if the images downloaded from your camera before you delete the photos from the camera .
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can only select the desired using the standard optional methods of &amp; none . once you selected the photos , use the button to download and then selected . the button you selected will have selected until you selected some photos . &quot;
&quot; if your camera supports this , an option is new to download now . these images have not been downloaded from &amp; digi@@ ous ; in this case the new pictures are marked with a star in the thumb@@ nails . if you choose this option , of course only the new images are downloaded . &quot;
&quot; when you use the buttons , you can download or select the image , appears in which the photo will be placed . the list of existing albums are displayed , displayed as regular folder , displayed in the section M@@ eine albums . select the target album from the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ ous ; loads the photos from the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all deleted from the button . if you just want to delete the button Delete all , you need to select it first and delete it deleted . &quot;
&quot; please note that there is no possibility to restore photos from the camera to restore it . therefore , the photos won &apos;t be completely deleted . if you want to delete it from the camera . if you want to delete it from the camera , since this is much faster . &quot;
&quot; file formats used as fil@@ en@@ ames for the photos frequently does not load especially meaningful names . this can normally load to double fil@@ en@@ ames in the same album . therefore , it can be useful to integrate the date and time when the image was made to integrate into the file name . &quot;
in the next section you will find options for rotating and mir@@ rors of the image and for file @-@ based subtitles . if you use this last option automatically a folder per day is created .
&quot; the options regarding the transfer opens three more options , which will be done before the photos stored on the disk . the first two concern the data about the author in the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct the date &amp; time for all downloaded images . &quot;
&quot; if you wish to use a different dates than the standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix Photo@@ - % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % h : % M : % S . turn the option date &amp; time to add . for further adjustments you should read the help of the command . &quot;
&quot; if you use the option camera fil@@ en@@ ame , you have the option to change the file names in small letters . or in case letters , if you prefer . &quot;
the new fil@@ en@@ ame that came &amp; digi@@ ous ; for a photo is used below the name that displays the camera in preview . your settings to ren@@ ame will be saved and automatically used when you open the camera pattern .
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ous ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera to start recording . not all cameras provide this information . in the section page bar metad@@ ata , you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded into the photo . &quot;
&quot; the automatic rotation is normally switched , and if your camera would not provide this information , lets you switch off the automatic rotation speed , use the button below and select the automatic rotation in the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; when your camera is made available on the date when the photo was made available , it can be made available to download . all photos with the same date will be loaded in the target album . all the cameras will be downloaded in the target album . all the cameras will be included in the photo bar . in the section page bar Met@@ a data you can read , which information your camera might have embedded in the photos . &quot;
&quot; this option is normally off @-@ off , and in this case saves &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this option , use this option to switch . use this option to switch on the bottom of the window at the bottom of the window . &quot;
the easiest way to load photos from their computer to load your camera is the button . select dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears in which you can choose the files to be up@@ loaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
&quot; after choosing the selection is done , queries &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; you where the images will be loaded high . select a folder dialog for the camera . select the folder you want to start downloading . the images are not deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . it is a position meant to be specified in long@@ itu@@ dinal and l@@ ati@@ tudes and that can be displayed on a map . identification of the data can be done by the American GPS , the Russian Galileo or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical place . not everyone uses a plane to cardboard an area by automatic recording of GPS data to cart@@ ographic , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents . &quot;
&quot; if you have later forgotten where exactly the photo was made , you can add a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; users want to locate the place of the photos so , or just want to document this aspect , it &apos;s good the position data of a photos to us@@ p@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; the question is how do the GPS data in the image ? firstly , you should know that exi@@ v@@ 2 many GPS dat@@ ashe@@ ets , such as direction , saddle @-@ data and maps are actually supported . directly with the right hardware , via a post @-@ processing of GPS @-@ data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for the geographical mapping ( manual ) and finally about the manual input of known places . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera integrated with GPS @-@ unit . but there are a few who work with GPS receiving . either as a card module or through transfer of data to a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q i@@ ke Ko@@ dak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ric@@ oh Pro G3 Sony
&quot; downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with gp@@ sman or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . however , you must save this data in the gp@@ x format , as this is the only format that is supported by the module for the geographical assignment . &quot;
there are different programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS who can extract the data from images and GPS and cor@@ reli@@ ant . on the following page you can extract the same under &amp; Linux : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the long@@ itude and l@@ ati@@ tudes or other data , then you can use this script using the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the pre @-@ adhesive coordinates , e.g. by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ google@@ .com does not show European road types . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&amp; D came to give you so much control over his work routine as possible . there are many settings that arrived in menu Settings . to set up these settings again . you can switch between these settings in eight pages . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left .
select action can be used to display or start image editing . they set the standard behavior of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; if you click on an entry in the main view .
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the stand@@ ardis@@ ation of identity and the subject @-@ legal data . these data are automatically selected in the appropriate IP@@ TC data fields . also in a database synchron@@ isation , these data will be written in the IP@@ TC fields . &quot;
&quot; author Tit@@ le is a syn@@ onym for ver@@ b line : this field should contain the professional photographer of photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . as this is a detailed description of the author , this must also be filled . &quot;
&quot; Editor is a syn@@ onym for vendors : use this field to specify the photo , such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations ought to be entered here , then the group or agency that is available here should be en@@ umer@@ ated here . &quot;
the IP@@ TC @-@ actions save the data into the corresponding IP@@ TC field . this metad@@ ata is permanently contained in the picture and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ tization ; this metad@@ ata are also available in other programs and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ tization without getting lost .
&quot; images used as being built @-@ in document ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JP@@ EG images : this syn@@ cing the comments you add to your photos , with which included in the pictures are included in pictures , they are already over@@ written by those of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ tions ; over@@ written . &quot;
&quot; the page settings contains all options for the information that appear if the mouse cursor in the main window will be ru@@ ined by a file . depending on the chosen option , this information will display or not . &quot;
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; supports a number of different image formats and some video formats and audio formats . to view which data types and digi@@ ti@@ fications ; you can add the file extensions in a &amp; digi@@ ous ; Alb@@ um@@ folders that has no such extensions have been made by &amp; digi@@ ous ; ignored .
the standard settings can be reset again by pressing the button Get right of each category .
&quot; the settings of the lumin@@ ous from &amp; digi@@ ous ; can then be set on this page to the default values . however , some pictures are switched on if possible . some pictures also have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode . if you have one , then you can get even better inspection results . &quot;
&quot; by default the image editing a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can switch the toolbar without using the image editing in full screen mode . &quot;
over@@ - and covered areas of an image can be marked with dar@@ ker or lighter color in the picture . these colors will be specified here . in the image processing it can be activated with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 and can be switched off .
with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling is meant that the images are coded in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance than in colour information . please read this article in Wikipedia about the immediate explanation .
&quot; with the setting PN@@ G comp@@ ressed air , you can reduce the size of PN@@ G files . this operation does not reduce the image quality since PN@@ G have an ind@@ eli@@ ble algorithm . if you have a fast computer you can set this value on a high compression . it means 1 : a low and 9 a high compression . &quot;
&quot; with the option TI@@ FF files comp@@ ress , you can switch the de@@ fl@@ ates -@@ comp@@ pres@@ sion@@ ers for TI@@ FF @-@ pictures . this reduces the size of TI@@ FF @-@ images . it does not affect the image quality since the De@@ fl@@ ate algorithm . &quot;
&quot; with the setting of loss JP@@ EG @-@ 2000 files , you can easily retrieve them . even if you have written permission , the relationship between quality loss and file size has been written far better than the normal JP@@ EG . as this paragraph , metad@@ ata were not supported , but in the planning . &quot;
&quot; in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ ous , the image processing only has a picture viewed for photos . currently , it is very fast becoming a tool for mani@@ pulation of your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the default guide is that all green pixels are equal . if the adequate green pixel of the CCD @-@ sensor is responding to the pixel rate in the output . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimum loss of details . this option identifi@@ es a little soft , eliminated , but the 2x@@ 2 G@@ itter@@ ing pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD @-@ quality method . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the white cut is used to the camera . otherwise , it is used to use the automatic color balance . &quot;
&quot; this setting is used only if the white is not set the same . standard is it a fixed color balance , which was photograph@@ ed on a white card that was photograph@@ ed in the sunlight . &quot;
&quot; this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SLR cameras . the use of the second sensors has the effect to get more details in four steps more details , for other cameras this option will be ignored . &quot;
&quot; the standard is it the sh@@ re@@ ed , i.e. the parts of your images are burned down , due to the in@@ ability of your camera to view the se@@ asi@@ ly white . finally , you can choose some parts of the missing information in various Ros@@ at@@ balls . finally , you can attempt to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the item . &quot;
this is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast s@@ ati@@ se like green and red . &amp; I therefore attempt to re@@ construct the missing green and red parts from the still non @-@ saturated blue pixel . of course this is a question how much colour or white you want .
&quot; when you select the option , you get the option to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be customized for each image individually . &quot;
put the L@@ umin@@ aire value according to your taste . you probably have to put it slightly higher than the standard 1 . this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ ous . in order to keep the time for the demo@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should conservative conservative . &quot;
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to er@@ count a complete picture from the partial image data which provides a lot of cameras and that provides a matrix color@@ less pixel . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA @-@ inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction .
&quot; &amp; D came , and D@@ C@@ W present you three alternatives available : Bil@@ in@@ ear , V@@ N@@ G inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gradient ) was the first algorithm for me and that of me used paper . Bil@@ in@@ ear is interesting , if you are looking for a quick solution with a acceptable result . &quot;
&quot; if you know the color deviation of your lin@@ ers , you can set the red and blue correc@@ tive values here . this is certainly the best method for a color correction , since you are carried out during the raw con@@ dens@@ ation . &quot;
a profile translated the color information and gives instructions how these again should be given . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ ous ; information such as colour information is available from a color room to the other so the colors are as accurate as possible .
&quot; behaviour questions , if a picture is open in the image editing / colour management module with raw files . &quot;
&quot; color profile folder enter the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .c@@ ol@@ or / ICC , where you can store all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ tization , this folder will then be investigated during the Star@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; settings of the ICC profiles , you have here the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ abs ; for your profiles to be depos@@ ited . everything can be changed after opening the raw file later . &quot;
the color administration view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Arg@@ y@@ ll . here are only your pictures color@@ manages not the entire screen .
&quot; entry profiles should fit to the camera and model that you are using . not all profiles are created on the same type . there are some such as Canon , which have no colour mapping or gam@@ mak@@ or@@ re@@ structure . currently , d@@ cra@@ w gam@@ ma does not need for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to carry out the colour mapping . &quot;
&quot; there are other options such as the Soft &apos;s profile , which you can em@@ ulate about how your image can be back from a device . this is very useful before you can print a smaller color area than your camera and some colors are therefore very saturated . this could be manually correct , instead of getting on the fl@@ ashes of your printer . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras , it is quite obvious that color profile is intended for them . unfortunately , not for the models of Canon . therefore , there is a table of cameras and profiles which fit together . this answer is of course in@@ officially : &quot;
&quot; the Canon profile extension can be recognized the style for the target : F for an exact style , L for landscapes , N for Neutr@@ al , P for portrait and S for the standard style . &quot;
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; imaging and imaging work ; many modules support , which have been written to co @-@ operate with each program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface . &quot;
&quot; if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select that you want to use , and these modules will appear as new entries in the menu of the main window , and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the preview . &quot;
&quot; short @-@ command for tasks that can be performed by modules , can be set in the menu under settings short command . &quot;
further information ( in English ) via K@@ IP@@ I modules can be accessed via the K@@ IP@@ I project at http : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manual @-@ books of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
&quot; the settings of the slideshow should be easy to understand . the upper regul@@ ator jus@@ tifi@@ es the time between the images , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . the other tick @-@ areas shut down the metad@@ ata or off , which ends at the bottom of the pictures during the ad . &quot;
&quot; the camera properties show on the left a list of all supported cameras . on the right side there is a button automatic detection , which is trying to connect the camera correctly , connected and in the image of the image mode . below are the Port@@ als , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire @-@ mass storage . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom end , you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) . this field is only active if you choose a cup of US@@ B@@ - or Fire@@ Wire @-@ mass storage camera from the camera list . you need to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ ns / . , specify on which you attach your camera . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ tization , you need to connect the camera to your computer , to bring them to the display mode . &quot;
&quot; pro@@ bi@@ ere you out whether &amp; digi@@ tization ; the camera is automatically recognis@@ able ; if not , you can set c@@ am@@ o@@ del and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera camera . &quot;
&quot; you can choose any name for your camera . it is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can insert all here . &quot;
&quot; with the option confirmation dialog for the shif@@ ting of &gt; Images in the M@@ ül@@ lei@@ mer , you can adjust the inter@@ loc@@ alisation of &amp; digi@@ ous ; when delet@@ ing a photos on an album . in the sections of delet@@ ing a photos and delet@@ ing a album you will find further details . &quot;
&quot; editorial changes due to the right side bar may shut down through &amp; digi@@ ti@@ bly , if you use the option changes in the right side bar without queries . otherwise , you need to apply changes to the button changes . &quot;
you can also include the indication of the welcome screen of &amp; digi@@ ous ; in case of start@@ up . this acceler@@ ates in circumstances the start@@ up process of &amp; digi@@ ous .
the setting of Bei@@ m start looking after new pictures are for@@ cing &amp; digi@@ ous ; the base folder after new or deleted albums / photos ; this extended the run@@ time of &amp; digi@@ ous ; if something from the base folder was deleted , queries &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; you whether it should delete it from the database . &quot;
different color schem@@ as can be used in &amp; digi@@ ous ; used to adjust the main window to your tastes . these settings can be selected using settings design from the toolbar . selecting the available designs will be raised below :
&quot; these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ tization , please find further information about it in this tutorial . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ous , contains a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and to be correction and improvement . the image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu , preview and selection of the entry list / editing . &quot;
the image editing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ tization . they are therefore not part of your distribution . further information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules can be set in section editing .
&quot; a status line at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current fil@@ en@@ ame , en@@ ame factor and the current image size shows . &quot;
a menu bar on the upper edge and below the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently used functions .
editing functions of the image processing change your photos . however no of the functions will change the original f@@ oto before saving file or stor@@ ing from the toolbar . note that you can no longer recover the original photo as soon as you have stored the picture .
so you should restore a copy of your image before you change it . this can save you with file saving .
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original picture by using the button file re @-@ establish or use the button reco@@ ver@@ able re @-@ processing in the toolbar . you will then lose any change that you have been carried out at the photo since the last time . &quot;
&quot; virtually any action of the image processing can be und@@ one or restored . the last action you can un@@ subscribe , by selecting the editing process or restored by selecting Edit@@ ing from the menu . &quot;
&quot; if you are frequently using this , you should make yourself the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ trl ; -@@ Z to get back and C@@ trl ; -@@ Shift Z to re @-@ establish . &quot;
&quot; if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; over the return or restore button in the toolbar a moment you get a context menu . if you select one of the menu items , all actions are also un@@ vei@@ led or restored . &quot;
&quot; once you have started the editing process , you can move between photos in the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar , image high , image r@@ amp@@ ed or the entries in the menu file , you will be asked if you want to save it . &quot;
&quot; you can enter in the photo and out zo@@ oming in which you can use C@@ trl ; mouse wheel or the symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the check @-@ in menu . &quot;
&quot; to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the toolbar : zoom factor automatically &quot;
&quot; view of full screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . usually , you can use the toolbar panel . normally , you can change this in the setup dialog by &amp; digi@@ ous ; this allows you to view this in the setup dialog box . you can view this topic for viewing the image processing . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current picture , you can print in the menu File image and get the standard &amp; k@@ de ; printing dialog . you can adjust the settings below before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu , you can print individual pictures or whole sent@@ ences . complete images can be printed out of your choice . you only need to select the pictures with the standard methods and select from the menu album Export wiz@@ ard . if you follow the wiz@@ ard , you just need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; D came ; main window has a side bar on the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same page bar is available , even in the editing editing . it is displayed when one of the five hor@@ semen is cli@@ cked : &quot;
&quot; on the same rider , the side bar leaves the side bar or disappear again into the edges . &quot;
&quot; in the circum@@ stance view , you can enter into limit size or insert it . note the remark below . the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the cap@@ tions are copied into the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - fields so that you can use other programs . &quot;
the IP@@ TC data support only ASCII character and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut after 2000 characters and will be shaped . if you want to use the IP@@ TC @-@ labelling field in other applications then you should consider these restrictions .
&quot; after you commented it , you can either use the button or simply change to the next picture , the cap@@ tions are then saved . &quot;
&quot; besides the contact button , there is one button . with this you can read further metad@@ ata from the selected file or the database . but this is always done when you chose a metad@@ ata setting , which is always written into the pictures . &quot;
the section rating shows a review scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in Su@@ chen and sor@@ ting . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut . the rating from the side bar is always applied only to a picture . select multiple images at the same time select these from and use the context menu .
the rating is written in the IP@@ TC field ur@@ gency . the coding follows the schema in the following table :
the key@@ note shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the key@@ word tree and a selection box with the previously used in this &amp; digi@@ box ; meeting key@@ word key@@ word . &quot;
the key@@ word tree will be adjusted dynam@@ ically to the specified search term . you can quickly restrict the number of options when searching for a key@@ word . this ability is particularly useful if you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom is another relief in the input of key@@ word at a picture series . if you have specified different keywords , these are stored for quick access . &quot;
key@@ word can also be set by mark@@ er of the corresponding propor@@ tions fields in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC field key@@ word .
&quot; when multiple images are selected in the main window and you choose a key@@ word in the key@@ word , this only appears on the highlighted picture and not for the entire selection , if you want a selection with a key@@ word , please read the section key@@ word filter . &quot;
&quot; the side bar sampling is used to change the selection of the displayed images . usually , the left side bar is used with their album , - Dat@@ um@@ - , stit@@ ching and search views . if in addition , one or more key@@ word filter is used on the right . all of the displayed keywords are available . &quot;
&quot; you can also draw tags and place . suppose you have been selected in the main view to provide you with key@@ word . if the key@@ word already exists , you can simply drop it out of the right side bar and then appears to choose a dialog you ask if you want to put the key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example the main window shows the images on a calendar tag . the key@@ word filter is displayed on no key@@ word . they were picked up with Str@@ g + a , and afterwards a key@@ word from the right key@@ word tree will be pulled and there . a dialogue asks , whether this key@@ word should be put . &quot;
this search for changes takes place at each start of the program . it can also be folded under settings on your settings .
&quot; if you have a rule with and created and notice that it would be one or its , you can easily change it with a double clicking on the text and in the control area . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the entry , after which in the database is needed . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , image , keywords , etc . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) : the argument for the oper@@ ator , which is a name or string , which is already placed in the database . &quot;
you can e.g. specify a detailed search across all the elements of the database including the following options :
&quot; if you want to group options , you only need the tick field at the end of the rule and then use the button group@@ ing . the options then follow as follows : &quot;
why have Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Flick@@ r not listed ? free disk space is restricted to 1 GB and you will not want to store the images in full resolution .
this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I got it mainly on &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; s made concrete implementation .
&quot; the reason why you select a color@@ managed workflow , which are the colors used by your camera or scanner come from actually photograph@@ ed or sc@@ anned colors . with a color@@ managed workflow , you can reach that the colors on your monitor can print from your camera or scanner and the colors that you print or in the web publish them out of your digital dark@@ room . &quot;
&quot; if the topic comes in colour management , everyone wants to know what buttons it does need to provide adequate information about colour management work@@ flows . the sense of this tutorial is to give you adequate information about colour management work@@ flows . additionally , you will find links with deeper information to make your own inform@@ ated decisions to make you the desired results . &quot;
&quot; if your image is fulfilled all the criteria listed below , then you must not take care of color management . &quot;
you are working on a monitor that is on the s@@ R@@ GB farms . ( more information can be found below )
&quot; your only other image issues are per email or the Web , where s@@ R@@ GB is the de @-@ facto standard . &quot;
&quot; so if s@@ R@@ GB works so well and the life for everyone is so easy , why should one use another color room and thus have to worry about colour managers ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of the limitation of s@@ R@@ GB compared to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hors@@ esho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ R@@ GB with some larger color areas , so visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s page and then click Info and then to Information About R@@ GB Working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
do I need to listen to my monitor k@@ alli@@ bri@@ er if I decided to work only in the R@@ GB of Far@@ br@@ aum ?
&quot; yes ! whether you work in the s@@ R@@ GB farms or not , you need to work your monitor k@@ alli@@ bri@@ er , as s@@ R@@ GB will work out that your ; on@@ itor is working on s@@ R@@ GB k@@ alli@@ bri@@ be , then you must use either your monitor on the s@@ R@@ GB standard , a matching monitor profile or both . &quot;

&quot; this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions available , which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before you try a further manual editing . &quot;
&quot; the functions norm@@ alize , de@@ same , automatic and contrast upgrading from the menu cor@@ rigi@@ ble automatic correction will automatically attempt to make the best out of your colors . you will be experimenting with these effects to see which best suits your photo . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this method escal@@ ates the lumin@@ ous values over the entire image , so the dark@@ est point black and the brigh@@ test point as bright as possible without its colour sh@@ aded . this function is often a magical correction for pictures the dark or adult . &quot;
&quot; ab@@ stain from the colors of the selected image , so that hist@@ olog@@ ram of the intensity is as flat as possible . thus , it &apos;s nearly excellent results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it is also just cra@@ p . it is a very powerful operation that causes either wonders in an image or destroyed it . &quot;
&quot; automatic ab@@ norm@@ alities : this method maxim@@ izes the color area in the red , green and blue @-@ channel . they select the dark and bright limit @-@ tones and adjust the red , green and blue channels on the complete hist@@ og@@ ram area . &quot;
contrast increases : this method improves the contrast and lumin@@ osity of the R@@ GB values of an image through the shif@@ ting of the lowest and highest values on the maximum possible area and a re@@ ji@@ usti@@ ble of all values in between . this is only visible in full @-@ selected images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the whit@@ ep@@ ha@@ y of &amp; digi@@ kl@@ ed ; is a semi @-@ automated tool to perform the white cut off of a photos .
&quot; the white @-@ straight correction is something limited to a color room with 8 @-@ bit per colour . in case you can perform far from the original structure , areas with over@@ exposure mode , which in 16 @-@ bit mode can be used , so your options for correction is better . &quot;
this tool is based on a white cut @-@ like algorithm of the copyright by Paw@@ el T. Jo@@ ch@@ ym . they launch it over the menu entry colors white cut the image processing .
the fore@@ finger can be adapted in size . on the left side you can see the original picture as well as the preview of the target image . the preview will look dynam@@ ically to the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original whit@@ ening right away then it is available on the sub@@ window .
the preview of the target image has a red mark@@ er . the L@@ umin@@ ous of the Pix@@ els under this mark@@ er is shown as a vertical line in the olog@@ ram .
&quot; right up , a hist@@ olog@@ ram is shown that dynamic changes . this hist@@ olog@@ ram is very helpful , even in well illuminated images , most pixels very small L@@ umin@@ ated values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ous . &quot;
the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and gam@@ ma . the shadow lig@@ n@@ ment allows you to improve the st@@ un@@ attend@@ ant of your photos or also tri@@ m .
&quot; to play with the above checks , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette , click on this button and afterwards to use anywhere on the screen &apos;s watch to use selected color for the calculation of the color temperature of the white cut off . this way also the temperature and green values are automatically set . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the whit@@ ening with the list of preference . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ exposure indic@@ ator increases the colors when more than a color channel of the pixels is over@@ exposed .. you will display the combined result in the white cut off . this is displayed in the Preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
buttons Save as and Download exactly this . any setting of the white cut is set you can save it into a text file and load later .
the button pres@@ ets sets all the filter values again on their standard values and the corresponding neutr@@ als . note that also neutral settings can be changed another photo as your original . if you save it your origin@@ ality is changed .
&quot; you can set here the codi@@ le of the applied image . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JP@@ EG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better suited for high quality images . these en@@ coding is also needed for high quality images , th@@ me@@ tic time and stands for the formats PN@@ G , PN@@ M , TI@@ FF and DN@@ G . &quot;
&quot; this tool opens the same dialog as to the processing of raw materials . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . colour mapping can be performed by the sub@@ window for the brightness of color , you can drag the Chapter G@@ ear to Rate . &quot;
&quot; another important tool is available in the menu under colors of sound correction . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels at the same time and allows you to use your settings , so you can always use the same error . in the manual on the key correction , you will find further information . &quot;
a very powerful option to correct exposure problems is the tool for Gra@@ dation that you can find under colors Gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ ous ; tool of color effects will give you four color effects , a vel@@ ocity @-@ effect , a ne@@ on effect and a cant@@ on filter at your disposal . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing , solar mer@@ ization , also Sab@@ atism was called , an effect of the image created by the additional light . this was the effect that the ligh@@ tening areas were dar@@ ker and the colors performed by the second illumination . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine . &quot;
the intensity controls the solar ization . at about 50 % intensity the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . a further increase is finally a negative image that is so not to create a negative image .
this is an example of the solar panel . the origin@@ ality is the ( 1 ) and which has been revised ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vivi@@ d @-@ Filter simul@@ ates the so called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; -@@ effect . he differs from a satur@@ ation so that he makes a stronger contrast @-@ effects that he makes a stronger contrast and gl@@ ass@@ ing . try it simply , he em@@ bell@@ ished many photos . &quot;
&quot; Vel@@ via is the brand name designed for a day@@ light colour film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition from &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for his smooth image structure . Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for his smooth image structure . Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot are highly saturated color , but also some photographs , especially those who are barely landscapes . &quot;
the neo @-@ filter simul@@ ates on the contrast . the parameters level controls the brightness of the result and sli@@ der re@@ peti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on . at large images the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it &apos;s therefore not unusual to correct the color contr@@ asting your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . all your adjusting entries can be viewed in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result you use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
&quot; when you make a photo of bad light conditions , you can get the um@@ b problem : a good choice to reduce the satur@@ ation . also in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation will be able to see you . if you like reading the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k . &quot;
&quot; between the complex tool gravity and the simple lumin@@ osity / contrast / gam@@ ma , the tool is very complicated for improving the ventilation of exposure . even if the dialog for this tool is very complicated , you need to explain the three sli@@ ders below the hist@@ og@@ ram . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graphs of the intensity values , an hist@@ olog@@ ram , the active channel or of the selected area . under graphs are three sli@@ ders to change , the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright side areas . &quot;
the easiest way to learn the operation is to move the regul@@ ator and respect how the image changes .
&quot; on the right , the original and the preview of the picture can be viewed . the preview will dynam@@ ically , based on the settings of the picture , updated . on the left hand side are the following options . &quot;
sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be adjusted whether the hist@@ og@@ ram with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y @-@ axis is often the linear hist@@ og@@ ram by a single column domin@@ ates . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic disposition is useful .
&quot; three regul@@ ator : the top priority for the dark ones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle notes , frequently gam@@ ma values . &quot;
&quot; the three colour types can be used in the preview of the original image , to adjust the input into the shade , middle and light tones automatically . in addition , there is one button for fully automatic adjusting . &quot;
output rating : the output levels enable the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two shelves which can be used to change the output rated as background . the compression of the output can be used e.g. to create a hidden image as background while something else in the fore@@ ground .
&quot; automatically : with this button , the image values will be set automatically depending on the intensity values . &quot;
&quot; save as and loading : with these buttons , the file values can be stored in file system and loaded later . it will be used in Gimp format . &quot;
&quot; when you use this mode and the three colors will use the input inst@@ alls automatically for all shadows , means and Sundays , click the color pi@@ p@@ ets which you want to use and click on the preview of the original article for Rot@@ or , green , blue and the L@@ umin@@ es@@ can@@ als . &quot;
the option over@@ exposure indic@@ ator controls all colour channels to display over@@ covered pixel and you can view the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator that you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see an example of the A@@ lig@@ n@@ ment of the inputs applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and Alpha channel , as well as the output property is unchanged . the origin@@ ality is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left side , half of the original and the target image is displayed . the preview will be updated dynam@@ ically depending on your settings . on the right hand side are the following options : &quot;
modification channel : this selection box allows the channel to specify the connection that is changed by the module :
&quot; besides this box , there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ istical view . for pictures with a digital camera , the linear mode creates a wide beam . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode will help . &quot;
&quot; if you move e.g. a short panel to the right , e.g. the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones with dar@@ ker for@@ ks and that the associated image pixel are dar@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; on the preview of the original photo is a red mark@@ er to see . if you want to change this mark@@ ings on the area you want to change the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down , until the value is adjusted to your taste . &quot;
save as and loading : with these buttons you can make exactly this . each bend that you have created can be stored in file system and loaded later . the file format is the Gimp &apos;s cam format .
&quot; if you create this method and the three colour pi@@ ps , you automatically create the check@@ points of the curve for all channels of the shadow , middle and sun @-@ t@@ ints . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to put the control points for the red , green , blue and L@@ umin@@ aire curve . &quot;
the option over@@ exposure indic@@ ator controls all colour channels to display over@@ covered pixel . if in more than one channel over@@ covered pixels that you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a black @-@ white photo which was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ aire @-@ canal . shadow and sun @-@ tones was applied with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the ben@@ ds . the origin@@ ality is applied ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel bl@@ ender of the &amp; digi@@ tization has been a tool to improve the color can@@ als or change the shades of the photos .
the channel mix@@ er is another sophisticated tool to mix the color @-@ tones of images . you can edit it from the menu color channel mix@@ er of the image processing .
with the channel optional box you can select the color for hist@@ olog@@ ram : this gives you a first reference how to correct the channels by selecting the relative distribution and rash . the left area of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed as a comparison of your own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red mark@@ er . if you position it in the picture a vertical line appears in the ch@@ olog@@ ram to show you the appropriate color .
&quot; the controls for the module are right down : regul@@ ator for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you are also reading the appropriate color components . this is particularly convenient , if you also use the appropriate color components . try to reduce the Green black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green can@@ als for black and white por@@ traits . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of one color comes to a visible cat@@ erer , which does not occur at the same place in color can@@ als and whose rob@@ ber@@ y consists in each channel differently . if that is the case you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion so that you can reduce the bull first . &quot;
saving and loading buttons are exactly used for this purpose . any type mix@@ er can save you for later and then load it . the used file format is the Gimp channel Mix@@ er format .
the option over@@ exposure indic@@ ator controls all colour channels to display over@@ covered pixel and you can view the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator that you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the Blue Channel was re@@ activated . the option L@@ umin@@ ous is activated . the origin@@ ality is under ( 1 ) and the worked image below ( 2 ) .
black / White @-@ photography was always fascinating because of your abstr@@ action . with the development of digital photography is black / white a working horse because color pictures can be easily converted to the computer . also with a set of film @-@ roll profiles .
&quot; Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3200 , Il@@ ford FP@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford HP@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P2 Super &quot;
&quot; Grün@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film@@ strip with a green lin@@ qu@@ filter . this looks good , in all scen@@ eries and fits particularly well with por@@ traits against the sky . thus similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Grün@@ filter . &quot;
Oran@@ ge@@ il@@ ter : simul@@ ates a black / white film @-@ exposure with a orange lime filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and a@@ erial photos . thus similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) or@@ anges . &quot;
Rot@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white movie exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic mer@@ ging effects and can simul@@ ate lun@@ ches to the day @-@ time . thus similar to the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Rot@@ filter .
yel@@ low@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film@@ exposure with a yellow lin@@ eup filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Gel@@ b@@ filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : produces warm bright and medium tones while trying to add a bit col@@ dness in the shade of a pressure and the re@@ development in a Sep@@ iat@@ ry . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and thus similar to the 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; digi@@ ous ; tool texture enables you to apply decorative tex@@ tures to an image .
&quot; adding a text to your image , regardless if there is a color picture or not , you can look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop Art Portrait of enlarged points or like a wall picture on a wall . the menu entry image text uses the image processing can be used for it . &quot;
Rel@@ ief : moving this parameter to the right increases the sem@@ bl@@ ance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper textile effect has been applied in the photo below . the origin@@ ality is set ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) . the parameter Rel@@ ief has been set to 200 .
&quot; with the &amp; digi@@ ous , tool frame can add a decorative framework to add an image . &quot;
the eye of an observer in the limits of a photo is not easy task . a way to keep his attention is to keep the image a decorative frame . this is a psych@@ ologic barrier to watch the image . below image frame can be started out of the image processing .
&quot; type : with this parameter you set the desired type type for your image . through detail , the picture with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce envel@@ oping it with a thin line and a broad frame ( ideal for black and white images ) , pul@@ ling it with a cute tri@@ plex frame of the ideal for a button and decorations adds a decorative frame with patterns . &quot;
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . value range for width is limited to 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; that with the frame of the target image will be bigger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing of images , especially if you have used the tool with aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; with this practical tool , you can insert simple a form@@ atted text into a picture in any picture . this also goes to several places when you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text device , orientation , color from the color area and the character set with its features like you need . the size the character must be . at the end , you simply choose a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ covered background . &quot;
&quot; each setting that you have chosen for your text can be changed , until you press the button &quot; &quot; OK &quot; . after the picture was once saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed . &quot;
with the &amp; digi@@ ous ; tool sten@@ cil can apply a template to a picture .
the menu image template uses in the machining process can be used to insert sten@@ cils via a picture .
&quot; for the sten@@ cil there are no limitations regarding the size and orientation . however , you need to add the PN@@ G file format and should add with maximum compression ( 9 ) to add a pattern of the sten@@ cil ; sten@@ cil add an e @-@ mail in English to the &amp; digi@@ tization ; mail@@ ing@@ list digi@@ arrived @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool for the first time , you need to put your sten@@ tions folder with the button basic folders in dialog . select the folder in which you have noticed the template files . these settings are taken for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after the root folder for sten@@ cil has been set for sten@@ cil , which reflects the folder structure of the sten@@ cil &apos;s folder . selecting a folder update the thumb@@ nails of the sten@@ cils . &quot;
under the Preview there are three buttons with which you can change the en@@ coding factor and the position of your image .
&quot; enlarge : this button has enlarged the bottom picture , it is centered to the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; reduced : this button sh@@ red@@ dened among them , and it is centered to apply the position of the mouse . in case you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you need to adjust the image according to the left mouse button . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move this button to move the image below the sten@@ cil image . take the picture and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the sten@@ cil to your picture . the image then will be automatically adapted to the thumb@@ nail .
&amp; D came ; presents three different tools for shar@@ pen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
&quot; shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and simple , however , especially in dark areas , gr@@ assy images . &quot;
In@@ shar@@ p Mas@@ ke is working on the contrast of the edges made to look around a picture . actually it &apos;s not a bit like it works rather psych@@ ovis@@ ual . you can use it to create atmospheric dun@@ ce and it &apos;s here a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gimp and he is copyrighted by W@@ inst@@ on Chang .
&quot; focuss@@ ing is possibly the best of the three , since it really is the shar@@ p@@ ness improved . he is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment . &quot;
photos without a focus and most digi@@ ti@@ sed images need a correction of shar@@ p@@ ness . this in turn leads to a common color together with only minimal differences . the same phenomenon can be observed if color points are printed on paper . SLR cameras normally need more el@@ ong@@ ated shar@@ pen@@ ing as normal cameras for private users .
&quot; at JP@@ EG images there is often a camera internal coating . images in the raw format , on the other hand , must always be cured in the processing process . &quot;
&quot; some scanner can turn to a lever filter during the reading of the picture . if you dis@@ abling this , you will get control of your image . &quot;
in some situations you can get used results by shar@@ pen a photo with the shar@@ pen@@ ing st@@ ables . this allows you to browse with the menu entry .
&quot; but you should deal with caution , since the results are not very natural : the shar@@ pen@@ ing the edges of the edges , but also intensi@@ fy the smoke . you can reach it via the menu entry reduction . under review , you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for shar@@ pen@@ ing . &quot;
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cold . the solution to draw a little soft is much easier than it shar@@ pen . use the tool to switch m@@ ould with the menu entry and experiment with your settings . the thumb@@ nails on the right side of the dialog box shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ quer@@ ade is a very good tool to remove v@@ eil from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original picture and the preview help to edit the image . the thumb@@ nails shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and amount . the default values are often good results and should first be tested . an increase in the radius or of the amount will reinforce the effect . if you create the in@@ shar@@ p@@ ly mask , cat@@ ers and get the impression of atro@@ cities close to sharp edges . &quot;
the radius one how many pixels by each side of a channel are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow bigger radi@@ i . you should therefore shar@@ pen the pictures best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the se@@ duc@@ ted image one of the original is added . thus the strength of the shar@@ p@@ ness will be put .
&quot; the threshold is a rup@@ ture from the maximum R@@ GB value and the difference difference . it can thus be used for a channel difference . in this way , these areas are avoided with a soft change between the tones of shar@@ pen@@ ing and therefore beauty bugs in faces , Heav@@ ens and water surfaces . &quot;
this is an example of the bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited picture the ( 2 ) . bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a tail worth = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; tool focuss@@ ing focused on an image by improving the shar@@ p@@ ness . it used to be protected by the copyrighted discharge filter by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to anticip@@ ate a picture &amp; quot ; re@@ focused approach . this is a better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ ters . it uses the traditional technique to shar@@ p@@ ly p@@ ly mas@@ cot . you can start it from the menu by using colors Re@@ focused in the editing process .
&quot; in practice the circular flows works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche F@@ altung . the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche Mu@@ zzle has a very long tail , which leads to the mathematical result also from the source pixel , which is far from original qu@@ ell@@ ings , which is largely influenced by the distant pixels . the causes of unwanted results . &quot;
circular shar@@ p@@ ness : this is the most important parameter for the use of this module . for most pictures the default value 1 good results result . you can put a higher value if your picture should be very bl@@ ur@@ red but then on Heiligen@@ stadt .
cor@@ relation : an increase in cor@@ relation can help to reduce arti@@ facts . cor@@ relation can be chosen from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0,5 and the values are close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.95 and 0.99 . a high value for the cor@@ relation reduces the shar@@ pen@@ ing effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; Rau@@ er@@ filter : an increase in the pre@@ filter can help you reduce art@@ e@@ facts . however , values higher than 0.1 only rarely can . if the smo@@ k@@ filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very poor . an appropriate value is 0,@@ 03 . a high value will continue to move the picture . &quot;
&quot; Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche shafts : this is the radius of the Gau@@ ß Gau@@ ß tray . in most cases you should use this value in 0 , to avoid anno@@ ying arti@@ facts . in most cases you should use this value to zero , so you might also have to increase the cor@@ relation and / oder@@ m filter . &quot;
Mat@@ ri@@ pper size : this value determines the size of the transform@@ ation matrix . an increase in the mat@@ ri@@ pper size can produce good results especially if you choose big values for the circular har@@ ness or the Gau@@ ß &apos;s Sch@@ är@@ fe . please note that the module is very slow if you choose big values for these parameters . in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
saving and charging buttons will be used exactly for that purpose . any number of re@@ focused parameters will be set in order for later and can be loaded later .
try to perform all the cutting , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the image before you use the module .
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before you change the picture otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations changes not immediately visible , but left later un@@ pleasant arti@@ facts . &quot;
&quot; when you read pictures and comp@@ ress , &amp; eg ; as JP@@ EG , you should apply the module to the un@@ comp@@ ressed picture . &quot;
generally produces bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king better results as shar@@ pen@@ ing . this could be caused by the bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king in a larger neighborhood as shar@@ pen@@ ing .
&quot; theoretically , you have to create a sharp mas@@ king over always art@@ e@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it can never show the effect of the iner@@ tia , at least as good as the In@@ shar@@ p Mas@@ ke . the F@@ IR Wiener Filter is often better in the processing of small details . &quot;
&quot; below you can see a comparison between different filters , on a small un@@ focused picture , see : &quot;
the original un@@ sharp colour picture has to be corrected . this picture has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus Lin@@ se .
&quot; for more information on the methods of shar@@ p@@ ouring , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address . &quot;
the regul@@ ator smo@@ ked the in@@ shar@@ p@@ ness of the area of the dark black@@ ed to create a natural phal@@ om@@ ile .
&quot; the colour tin@@ ent enables a customized color for the P@@ up@@ ille . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust this here . &quot;
the tool inf@@ usion is one of the most advanced tool to remove not desired arti@@ facts with un@@ preced@@ ented speed .
the In@@ cludes algorithm was developed by IMA@@ GE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
&quot; this tool contains various pres@@ ets as a Star@@ points , to simplify the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are below en@@ umer@@ ated : &quot;
in case you want to adjust the filter settings in a adjust settings you can use the Rider smo@@ othing and advanced settings .
&quot; detail post@@ ure p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of details . a small value leads to a ri@@ ght@@ ful smo@@ othing across the image . a value of 0,@@ 9 should provide details so that no shar@@ pen@@ ing are necessary . &quot;
&quot; based on Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es in all directions while a value is close to 1 only in a direction . if you have a film @-@ made or CCD Rau@@ ma will produce a high value of w@@ oven patterns . JP@@ EG arti@@ facts are best removed in a value near 1 . &quot;
smooth@@ ed &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this puts the maximum smo@@ othing factor above all . put this value therefore suitable to the degree of noise in your image .
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter involves greater structures . the higher this value is set , the more becomes more smo@@ ked when there is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ enz@@ effects it must be higher than 3 . &quot;
re@@ peti@@ tions : returns how many times the algorithm is going through . usually there is 1 or 2 .
&quot; angle @-@ view page &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ ot@@ rop@@ en Alpha . if Alpha is small , it should also be small for a long term . you should therefore choose this value as much as possible and for your needs . &quot;
&quot; integral Sch@@ r@@ ag page &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integr@@ ally shot @-@ page in pixels . you should put the value smaller 1 to avoid Sub @-@ Pixel Gl@@ ory and never bigger than 2 . &quot;
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more quality you get by selecting this option is only low . he doubles but the run@@ time . we recommend it to let him .
buttons Save as and Download exactly this . any setting of image errors can be correct in a text file and loaded later again .
&quot; errors correct is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can nevertheless take very long and a high CPU load to move . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the kno@@ b . &quot;
below you can see how pic@@ tured bugs with little arti@@ facts will be corrected . the module is made on a photo that has been made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you see there is a peculi@@ ar black animal in the fore@@ ground that is caused by a poor screening during the trip caused by ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; D came ; Rau@@ sch@@ reduction is a very powerful tool to decrease images . it uses a copyrighted algorithm of Peter H@@ eck@@ ert .
&quot; this tool presents sel@@ ectable screen filter available to remove spots and other arti@@ facts , for example from dust or hair on the lens , to remove . it can also be used to remove sens@@ ory from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ dist@@ ute ; -@@ effects of sc@@ anned images made of books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information on Sensor@@ rau@@ schen from digital cameras , you can read these in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the screenshot above shows a typical scene which has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gr@@ assy noise which can be successfully removed with this tool .
&quot; in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window advanced settings may remain with the default settings . &quot;
&quot; radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) up to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is required for the filter . great values increase the time the filter per pixels and allows the image to be absorbed through the image and the color in it is adjusted , and so that minor errors are adjusted . &quot;
&quot; shar@@ p@@ ness : controls the noise level . this value sets the pix@@ el@@ ong@@ ation changes . if it is lifted , smoking filter will be adjusted . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details can no longer be preserved and sli@@ pping or lubric@@ ation again . &quot;
edges : controls the nec@@ essi@@ ties for the shar@@ p@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response to the filter . if it is too strong can not occur the entire noise or cra@@ w@@ inters . put it on a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a vig@@ il@@ ant or JP@@ EG arti@@ facts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ous intoler@@ ance of the picture . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to change a picture . these settings do not affect the gl@@ ass@@ ment process of the details controlled by the details .
color : controls the colour toler@@ ancy of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to change a picture . these settings do not affect the gl@@ ass@@ ment process of the details controlled by the details .
&quot; gam@@ ma : controls the g@@ intoler@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the toler@@ ances of the dark areas , which typically tend to increase stronger . it also poll@@ uted the shadow ranges . &quot;
&quot; absorption : controls the lig@@ ation of the ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ ing absorption . this value is defined as fast the adap@@ tive filter radius on variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is lifted up , the edges of smo@@ other can occur . he can remove noise and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter on the edges and is the recommended method for it . &quot;
&quot; save on and loading : these buttons are used exactly for that . all parameters for smo@@ kers you have set , can be saved into the file system and loaded later . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of how to change your life . the origin@@ ality is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) , which has been applied with default settings . &quot;
sometimes an image is to cris@@ p for your purpose . the solution to draw a little soft is fortunately much easier than an image to shar@@ pen and experiment with the sliding door . the thumb@@ nails on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; D came ; photo Rest@@ oration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo@@ art@@ ements .
&quot; this filter for restoration gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of unwanted art@@ e@@ facts from your images . it is very well adapted to immerse yourself in digital , original or down@@ lighted images , and thereby get the content as it is also the human eye . &quot;
the same algorithm can be used for colour and tex@@ tures . the tex@@ tures can be carried out with another tool that was developed by IMA@@ GE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JP@@ EG arti@@ facts reduce : the compression of JP@@ EG is not perfect in some areas even very far from it . as a compar@@ ative compression compress@@ or ; - small standards that are to be seen in the un@@ comp@@ ressed picture . this setting is to correct these problems .
buttons Save as and Download exactly this . any setting of photo restoration can be saved into a text file and loaded later again .
&quot; photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can nevertheless take very long and a high CPU load down . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the button . &quot;
below you can reduce like a photo with a equ@@ ator smoke . the module is applied to a black and white photo that with a min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera has been recorded with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the in@@ famous film compounds on the faces . the origin@@ ality is below ( 1 ) and the corrected among ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures was reduced to an old colour photo which was created with a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts created by the sc@@ ann@@ er@@ lights and the phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . the origin@@ ality is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ ous ; tool Hot@@ ab permits it to remove items from photos with a CCD camera , eight were used to remove algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pix@@ i project , which are copyrighted by Martin Dick@@ opp . &quot;
&quot; bright , total or hot pixel are particularly at high @-@ quality raw mode photos a problem , since many cameras with JP@@ EG compression over a built @-@ in repression for hot pixels . &quot;
&quot; this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; name pixel quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright pix@@ quot ; there are currently no manual method to select the bad pixels . &quot;
download this file into the wiz@@ ard with the button dark . the tool will be able to detect the hot and bright pixel . these are highlighted in the preview of the image .
&quot; when you have an old digital camera , it is important that you can take the dark directly in connection to discover new hot or light pixel by the CCD Def@@ ective . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should load the right dark picture to the corrected image . an automatic processing of the dark &apos;s image will find the bad pixels . note that the wiz@@ ard will notice the last dark @-@ picture and that automatically loads it in the next session . &quot;
the image area and the preview can help you correct the result within the image . the preview image shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels that are superior in all levels .
choose an area around the def@@ ective pixels on preview and the outcomes of the filter . select after that the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ed this pix@@ el@@ blocks . these are the available filters :
Dur@@ ing : it is determined an average of the N@@ eigh@@ s . the resulting color will be assigned to all def@@ ective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation it is separately made for horizontal and vertical line .
&quot; linear : all pixels that have a distance from 1 piece of pixel , are moved to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ DI@@ M ) or a group of linear cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ DI@@ M ) or a group of linear cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ DI@@ M ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ed pixels in the block to inter@@ pol@@ ishing . &quot;
square : this is the default fil@@ ter@@ method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less for pixel block will be moved to a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ DI@@ M ) or a group of square cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ DI@@ M ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the pixels in the block .
&quot; k@@ ub@@ ic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less will be moved to comp@@ el a bi @-@ c@@ ub@@ ic surface ( 1 @-@ DI@@ M ) or a group of k@@ ub@@ ic cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ DI@@ M ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ed pixels in the block . &quot;
&quot; below you can see the hot@@ line correction on a color photo , from a def@@ ective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , applied to 300 % enlarged ( 1 ) and the corrected picture is below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ tization is a tool to correct the vig@@ or , i.e. sub@@ ordin@@ ated corners , an image to correct . &quot;
&quot; vision objective , in particular the medium and large photo format , often illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they reduce the corners and edge of the picture by reducing the light to the sensor there . Tele@@ objective will also show this behavior . &quot;
&quot; but he also has dis@@ advantages . many Center filters require a factor 1 or 2 at the blast@@ en@@ den@@ filter , which is impossible to keep the camera with your hand . vision objective should also use with center filters , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , since otherwise un@@ fold effects by movement arise . &quot;
&quot; with the large covering areas of today &apos;s fil@@ ming and colour scanner , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a Center@@ filter by a equi@@ val@@ ance transformation at a raw image , which is applied without this filter . the tool of vig@@ net@@ ting correction is applied to an image . the algorithm is copyrighted by John Walker . &quot;
with three regul@@ ators you can control the vig@@ or correction filter and with three other the exposure of the target image .
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of light cushi@@ oning at the point of the greatest density . the default density is 2,@@ 0 , what a optical filter with a Bl@@ ending adjustment of 1 , or random@@ ly of a lumin@@ osity of 2 , correspon@@ ded the density to compens@@ ate for a greater degree of vig@@ il@@ ting , reduce it to compens@@ ate for a small degree . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ osity , contrast , and gam@@ ma settings : the editing of an image with the vig@@ net@@ ting correction reduces the lumin@@ osity of the pixels . you need to re@@ adjust the exposure of the target image with these options as you just need to raise positive values , as you just need to increase the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want a hos@@ tile re @-@ tuning of the target image , so let the values for illumin@@ ating / contrast / gam@@ ma at zero and use the gradient from the menu color Gra@@ dation . &quot;
this is an example of the vig@@ net@@ ting correction to an image . the original picture shows the vig@@ or in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a lamp and contrast correction was also carried out in the image with this tool .
the &amp; D came ; Lin@@ sen@@ ver@@ distor@@ tion is a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical lens on photos . it uses a protected algorithm by David Ho@@ d@@ son .
&quot; this tool works with geomet@@ ric fast@@ enings . colored distor@@ tions can not be corrected with this tool . &quot;
the co@@ efficient of the second gra@@ ins treats the general geomet@@ rical lever of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or counter @-@ wit@@ ch form of the image .
&quot; the co@@ efficient of the third gr@@ ades has a similar round effect , but also on the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot;
the co@@ efficient fourth gra@@ ades corrected the remote corners opposite the second gra@@ ins . if you combine these two can be eliminated any geomet@@ rical distor@@ tion almost eliminated .
&quot; general : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion second gra@@ ins . with negative values , tonn@@ ages can be corrected and positive values drop @-@ shaped distor@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; corner : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion fourth gra@@ ins . this value affects stronger at the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most Lin@@ sen the &apos; Cor@@ ners parameter , the trans@@ duc@@ ting parameters of the parameter . &quot;
zoom : this value escal@@ ates the image size and thus leads to correction first gr@@ ades through . negative values enlarge while positive the image smaller .
&quot; light : this value jus@@ tifi@@ es the brightness in the corners of the picture . negative values decrease the brightness of the picture in the corners , while positive values they increase . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , illustrated the dialog with a preview the distor@@ ting correction . the values that you use for your image will be saved and used at the next start as standard values . &quot;
the tonn@@ ages and c@@ ylind@@ rical correction should be carried out before all cutting or size changes . best perform this correction as all of the first time . if you want to cut a picture and then perform a tonn@@ y correction would be the effect .
&quot; to help you find the best correction tool , this tool provides a vertical and horizontal guide line . move the mouse button to fix the lines at this point , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards , you can correct the T@@ onn@@ - / c@@ ylind@@ rical flo@@ or@@ tion with the help of the lines . &quot;
&quot; if you correct a c@@ ylind@@ rical distor@@ tion , the resulting image black corners is correct . you can transform them with the cutting tool in the menu , cut out of the image processing or via the Zoom controller of this dialogue . &quot;
&quot; for most pictures , the tonn@@ en@@ shaped correction is made . the next logical step for some moti@@ fs , frame and paintings is the perspective so correct all the angle in the picture 90 degrees . note that when you keep the camera with your hand , you will always keep a light distor@@ tion of the perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the tonn@@ en@@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the origin@@ ality is under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to simul@@ ate infrared film by the G@@ imp@@ gur@@ u@@ .org website which is under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ ri@@ ar@@ ot@@ film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left side of the window , you can preview the area for preview . if you move the red rec@@ t@@ angle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the image . &quot;
&quot; below the thumb@@ nails , you can set two parameters set film gran@@ ularity and film @-@ sensitive when you want to simul@@ ate the gr@@ itt of a high sensitive film . the ISO @-@ regul@@ ator changes the amount of film compounds and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in conversion . green fields are white like snow ! &quot;
&quot; as the filter colour channels to reproduce from infrared film , especially the green canal makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos , as the color information is missing . &quot;
this is an example of infrared fil@@ me@@ tic applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the origin@@ ality of the movie is set among ( 1 ) and the worked image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film has been set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values produce a kind of au@@ ra in the se@@ ver .
&quot; the &amp; D came ; filter film gran@@ ularity is an easy to use tool to reproduce documentary t@@ ines on your images , such as the B / W Ko@@ dak Tr@@ i @-@ X , known . to increase the sensitivity of the films , the makers have great silver @-@ bas@@ kets of the photo@@ em@@ ul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; the film fl@@ edged effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move into the past . in case you want this special , gallery @-@ like , str@@ assen@@ photographic , gr@@ inder sight especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , so you need to use this filter . &quot;
&quot; with the regul@@ ator , the ISO @-@ sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ularity of the Kör@@ ner can be calibr@@ ated . the standard value is required , although often higher values need to be adjusted to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need even more bas@@ kets , so you can apply the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the film Director on a black / white picture . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and that worked ( 2 ) . the used film hy@@ pers@@ ensi@@ tivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ ous , filter oil painting , generates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright @-@ protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ ous , filter oil painting , gives your digital images a nice appearance like an oil painting . natural paintings and l@@ ac@@ tation are good for this effect . &quot;
&quot; there are two shelves to influence this effect . the top sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five out . th@@ icker brushes are suitable for large images . smooth@@ es controlled the sliding or , from the other side , the hinges . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the origin@@ ality is marked with the ( 1 ) and the machining is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and smo@@ ked 17 .
&quot; the &amp; D came ; filter coal drawing , used col@@ ouring and intensity , which are stres@@ ses to create a cohesion frame . it &apos;s helpful when you imagine , which scene you would have chosen to sk@@ etch you . this would have good pictures to start with it . &quot;
there are two shelves with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper regul@@ ator choos@@ es the pins and the lower the contrast ( sliding ) .
this is an example of the cohesion filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adapting the Int@@ ensity value .
&quot; the &amp; D came ; filter engraving , your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was stopped in wax . it uses a protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; D came ; filter gra@@ v@@ ure is a quick tool to resume your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . he works particularly well with images with a simple structure where color is not the most important thing . the filter uses the differences between colour and intensity to transform the image into a grey , mon@@ ary landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows the contrast of filtering . a value of 30 , equivalent to 10 % , is the default . &quot;
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the edited picture ( 2 ) . the depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a artwork by means of distor@@ ted se@@ ams . it uses protected algorithms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&quot; wave blocks 1 : shares the image in cells and makes it look , as if it is looking through glass blocks . &quot;
wave @-@ blocks 2 : analog to the shaft blocks 1 is distor@@ ted the image here with a different version of glass blocks .
some effects need a long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a artwork by means of sp@@ u@@ p effects . it is used by protected algorithms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Un@@ tough@@ er : know the image along ster@@ n@@ ap lines that eman@@ ates from a centre . this simul@@ ates the in@@ shar@@ p@@ ant a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often used in sports photography .
radi@@ al in@@ shar@@ p@@ ity : caught the image through rotation of the pixels by a focus . this simul@@ ates the in@@ shar@@ p@@ ness of a rotating camera .
distance : secre@@ tly the picture to create the effect of a not focused camera channels . the object seems to come back into the background .
&quot; request : ver@@ tically the image through horizontal movements of pixels . this simul@@ ates the in@@ spec@@ tions of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photograph@@ ing , camera . &quot;
&quot; soft@@ ness in@@ let the image soft in the dark and strong in the light tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ aming and glos@@ sy soft focus ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating a romantic por@@ traits , gl@@ am@@ our photos or to add a warm and subtle bul@@ b . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; bulk materials : &quot; &quot; the image through random shift of the pixels and simul@@ ates the in@@ shar@@ p@@ ity of any moving camera . &quot;
intelligent in@@ shar@@ p@@ ity : finds the color bas@@ ins in the picture and de@@ du@@ ce them without changing the rest .
&quot; mos@@ ai@@ c : shares the photo in rectangular cells and then created it , through filling with an average pixel rate , new . &quot;
some effects need a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the button .
the shelves are a nice little tool to make shelves to your picture . thus it gives natural your images a b@@ asses appearance . it uses one by pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n protected algorithm .
dro@@ pl@@ et size allows to change the size of dro@@ pl@@ et . since the dro@@ pl@@ et size does not automatically cope with the size of the image . number changes the number and density of dro@@ pl@@ et . fish changes the op@@ tic effect of drop on the picture .
&quot; you can use with the &amp; digi@@ ers ; editing a range freely of rain drops . use the selection tool to choose the area , e.g. a face , which is to be free to choose . if you start the filter reg@@ ent@@ ro@@ p , the area will remain free of rain drops . &quot;
this is an example of the shelves . the original picture shows a quiet sunset and the edited picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the standard values were used for this example .
&quot; when the photo has the wrong orientation , so you can bring it through mir@@ rors or rotating in the right orientation . the tools can also be transformed in the menu or transform@@ ate mir@@ rors . &quot;
photo blo@@ ating is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo at a minimum loss of image quality .
&quot; a picture to hide is simple . the big question is , how can you find a picture and get the details sharp ? how can you find the missing information again ? how can you find the missing information again or guess ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm that will be used here ? how can you see the missing information again , try it and you will see it yourself . &quot;
&quot; when a photo has the wrong size , you can change it to the desired size with the tool size . select to change size in the menu and enter the destination values . the dialog is below to see . &quot;
&quot; the tool for the size is used to change a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method , in order to enlarge the pixels . if you want a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool for bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; many educational programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ tization has been developed a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo was developed by IMA@@ GE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
you must tell the tool how you want to change the size . these settings are available in the tab New size and are shown below :
&quot; note : if this setting is activated , the new size aspect of the original aspect of the original image is maintained . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter involves greater structures . the higher this value is set , the more becomes more smo@@ ked when there is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ enz@@ en@@ effects it must be higher than 3 . &quot;
buttons Save as and Download will be used exactly . any entries for photo can be saved as text file and loaded later again .
&quot; photo infl@@ ating is very fast with what it does , but it can nevertheless take very long and a high CPU load after turning . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button . &quot;
you can see below an example of photo screens with a small colour picture on the double size enlarged . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) . the original ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard magnific@@ ation .
&quot; cutting of a photo is not only a common operation , but also a often under@@ estimated tool to put an image . the image processing allows this very easy . to cut a photo with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and pull the rec@@ t@@ angle to create . you will then see this rec@@ t@@ angle then you will move the mouse . &quot;
&quot; when you get rid of the mouse button again , the area of the photos will be cut out . this gives you a good overview of how your photo could be cut after cutting . you can drag the height of the right angle . a new rec@@ t@@ angle can create , by simply drag the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the cutting cut , use the button The cutting button of the image processing in the toolbar and the photo is tailored ( C@@ trl ; + X ) . use the file save or save the file to save the newly loaded photo . &quot;
&quot; in the background , you can change the size of the rec@@ t@@ angle by changing the corners with the mouse . the side @-@ aspect that you have defined in dialogue will remain intact . &quot;
&quot; in the tool of side @-@ relationship , you can specify the orientation as a high @-@ format or a format . in the high @-@ format , the larger value of the height and in the cross @-@ format of the width is assigned . &quot;
&quot; the tool by aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same , regardless of whether you are cen@@ timet@@ res , In@@ ch or any other physical size . you can also see a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ sy and their side @-@ relationship . &quot;
at the right end of the dialog there exist two buttons to cent@@ red the selection automatically horizont@@ ally or ver@@ tically .
&quot; below in the dialog you can use the Max . ratio of button to cut down the area to the maximum possible , depending on the chosen relationship and orientation . &quot;
&quot; the tool can cut into aspect ratio , its settings vary depending on the orientation ( horizont@@ ally or ver@@ tically ) . if you are reading the tool system , these settings are displayed as standard levels depending on orientation . the modified image data will be reflected in the EX@@ IF data , so that the EX@@ IF data are reflected in the original picture and not the origin@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the set @-@ up assistance allow themselves to be related , so that you can put your pictures better . these help are : &quot;
&quot; harmon@@ ious triangle : harmon@@ ious pitches are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third el@@ shelf , harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles are a possibility to share a rec@@ t@@ angle in similar harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles at the di@@ agon@@ als . &quot;
golden middle : the golden middle is a division that focuses on various natural growth patterns like the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us Mu@@ schel or the leaf blades of a sun@@ flower . it emerg@@ es in all kinds of things we seem as beautiful .
&quot; Golden partition is the ir@@ rational number 1.6@@ 180@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it has been used for the ancient Egyptians and Greeks , which makes your temple and pyrami@@ ds . artist and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put your images , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is derived from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i episode 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; from where each number is equal to 1 equal to the sum of its two pro@@ gres@@ sed numbers . a composition that is usually followed as vis@@ ually harmon@@ i@@ ously . &quot;
the golden middle represents flu@@ ids @-@ lines . if you put an image together . these help are en@@ umer@@ ated below :
&quot; the Golden spiral will bring you closer to your goal for your photos . compared to the third el@@ reg@@ ation , the golden spiral produces a liquid spiral along the line of the spiral , and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow . &quot;
&quot; another rule are the rec@@ tan@@ gles of golden spiral , also called golden law@@ ns . this right corner is used to create the golden spiral . this can be a line or different objects . this something can simply be out of the eye , it will fulfil its task . &quot;
&quot; the Golden Tri@@ angles are also leading from the above g@@ ild@@ ed golden spiral . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not syn@@ onymous tri@@ angles . di@@ agon@@ als can not place a static object of dynam@@ ically . &quot;
&quot; when you use golden triangle to cancel your frame , you create an effect of using professional photo@@ graphi@@ es Dynamic Sym@@ met@@ ry . try to place your screen saver at one of the cutting points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot reach any other way . &quot;
the options horizont@@ ally reflect and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmon@@ ic parts .
&quot; with the button color , you can set the color of the auxiliary lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast can be invisible . this way you can customize the color of the lines in your current picture . &quot;
the free rotation is a tool to turn an image to any angle .
&quot; if you make a photo , then it &apos;s easy to keep the camera not exactly ver@@ tically or horizont@@ ally . this creates an image in which the things turned to fix a angle . you can fix it with the &amp; digi@@ tization ; select Free rotation and adjust the target angle . &quot;
&quot; turn your image with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ ders are specified in degrees . with the button default , you can reset the sli@@ ders back to 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown on the right . &quot;
&quot; for your help , the module is free rotation a horizontal and a vertical line available . move the mouse pointer at the image show around the two lines . now you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous sections . &quot;
&quot; after you turned into an image you will find unwanted holes in the corners . a way to repair it , it is the function of transform@@ ating cutting out of the image processing . &quot;
an elegant way to cut the image is the function Autom@@ atically cutting . select one of the following options :
the option Anti @-@ ali@@ asing smooth@@ es the picture a bit after the rotation . take note of the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tive transform@@ ations are performed by a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is represented in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares to the corners of your image . the preview will then be re@@ comp@@ uted automatically . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which will help you to change the perspective :
&quot; new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas that were created by the transformation in pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas that were created by the transformation in pixels . &quot;
angle on the top left : displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transform@@ ated territory .
angle on the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transform@@ ated territory .
angle left below : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transform@@ ated territory .
angle right below : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transform@@ ated territory .
&quot; according to the adjustment of the perspective the image becomes a little poll@@ uted . for a single adjustment , this effect is small , but two adjustments create a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
after you get the perspective you get un@@ happy tri@@ angular holes on the corners . a way to see it is the picture with transform@@ ating cutting out of the image processing .
&quot; the Schengen tool is used to move a part of the image into one direction and move the other part into the opposite . a horizontal guide , for example , the upper part of the image is turning right . in other words , a rec@@ t@@ angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ og@@ ram . you can transform this module over transform@@ ers . &quot;
adjust your image by clicking the horizont@@ ally angles and the vertical angle . you can press horizontal and vertical angle at the same time . if you see pres@@ et at zero . a preview of the effect will show you and the new dimensions of the target image are shown on the right of the display area .
&quot; to your help , a vertical and horizontal line appears . move the mouse to an important point like the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool system to adjust your picture . &quot;
&quot; after you have performed the sh@@ ear , the image becomes a bit tri@@ mm@@ ed . for a single sh@@ ear , this effect is usually negl@@ ected , but two shots are twice as much promise and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after the sh@@ ear , the image has un@@ nice tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to remove it is the image with transform@@ ating cutting out of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ tization ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write pictures . the available formats are therefore comp@@ uted by your system and , in some cases , some of the way these libraries have been comp@@ uted . in most distribu@@ tions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ tization . &quot;
&quot; because of this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all available file formats . however , you will always find JP@@ EG and TI@@ FF . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ous , only files in formats used to know . this happens according to the extension and comparison of these with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list . you can change this list of file extensions . you can modify this list of file extensions . in the section configuration you will find more information about this . &quot;
virtually all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JP@@ EG or TI@@ FF . some cameras will allow you to select to select format . a detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ ous ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression drive on digital pictures . the redund@@ ant information is reduced to save the image data on an efficient way .
&quot; JP@@ EG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , gl@@ atter@@ e results as JP@@ EG for the same compression effect . the 200@@ 0s release can also store freely if this is specified in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to learn more about the raw material format , you can read about Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can convert raw format pictures in JP@@ EG or TI@@ FF with the Roh@@ an converter from &amp; digi@@ ous . in the section configuration you will find further information on how to use modules with &amp; digi@@ ous . &quot;
&amp; D came ; supports the loading of raw image only with the program d@@ cra@@ w which is available in &amp; digi@@ tis@@ . all support cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Co@@ in . the table below shows a brief list of raw materials that are supported by &amp; digi@@ tization :
a lot of digital cameras are supporting the recording of short films . these clips came often in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ ous ; however , this formats will display and edit . if you click on a movie file again &amp; digi@@ ous ; the &amp; k@@ de ; settings to play movies can be used to play the program for playing . &quot;

all configur@@ able cameras will be recorded here . you can use the entry camera from the menu to add a new camera to the list . please check in the camera or set up further information .
K@@ IP@@ I module is a series of images exported to a K@@ ML structure . K@@ ML files can be opened and displayed with Goo@@ gle@@ Earth .
&quot; if you can switch steps 4 and 5 , what you can make good when the initial contrast was very good , then you can perform the first four adjusting entries with the white module . &quot;
many tools you need to need the photo processing are included in &amp; digi@@ ous ; their description will follow here .
&quot; all image work tools such as sh@@ ov@@ es , m@@ ould , dis@@ bl@@ ur@@ red , bl@@ ur@@ red , bl@@ ur@@ red , and etc ; . use a uniform dialog type that is applied to the current picture before the filter is applied to the current picture . below you see &amp; quot ; Text@@ texture an@@ wen@@ den@@ quot ; in this dialog : &quot;
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current picture . links of it allow five buttons to change the compar@@ isons of the thumb@@ field . these modes are :
ver@@ tically sharing a filter without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected ch@@ ant@@ ment .
horizont@@ ally sharing without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper area shows the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the area below the selected thumb@@ nail .
vertical split . the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
horizont@@ ally sharing . the upper area shows the original and the lower compared to the effect of the filter .
&quot; mouse over &apos; -@@ style : displays the preview if the mouse is not in the background , and otherwise the original . &quot;
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that can turn on to display over@@ - and sub@@ exposure . the colors can be adjusted in the general setup page .
( 3 ) The frame to choose the preview . you can draw this frame with the mouse inside the image and put on the part of the picture by which you want to preview . the preview in the left part of dialogue will be updated immediately .
&quot; ( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons on your default values . all settings may be noticed by the latest use of the module . &quot;
the side bar features shows the essential information about the selected picture and is largely explained . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo features : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when these are available .
this tab represents an intuitive card @-@ tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can click with the mouse wheel or click or move it . move it within the left mouse button . all the images within these coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . this requires naturally the your pictures ge@@ o @-@ data included .
&amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; is an editor for pall@@ ets files . the application can be used for editing col@@ pal@@ ettes and to choose and nam@@ ing colors .
the pall@@ ets files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de ; can be used either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case they are in your Personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user defined color and load @-@ used colours .
&quot; in the dialog range , you can select from a list of installed pall@@ ets or browse the folder according to files . &quot;
the cursor is displayed in the pall@@ et view as a line . it can be moved by cli@@ cked on the area next to a color .
it shows the color beside it . the colour is described under the pall@@ et view . here the colour name can be changed .
&quot; it can also be used to choose from . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cursor there . then move the mouse with the left mouse button of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if the junction box is attached below the button color , the color is inserted in the color panel on the cursor . the color will either be inserted or over@@ writing another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ write over@@ write . this mode can be set , by selecting the an@@ kreu@@ feld over@@ write under Bei@@ m cursor . &quot;
&quot; a selection that has been produced in the last section , can be used together with the promotions , cut and paste . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; used the following format for data on the clip@@ board : for each colour three values for the propor@@ tions of red , green and blue and an optional color name , followed by a pointer character , following another color , can be inserted as a color in &amp; col@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; &quot;
the colors in the palette and the output of the colour selection can be drawn with the mouse .
you can choose a color somewhere on the screen and then find them in the color box on the left side .
&quot; &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a KDE program for watching &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ programs are free layout programs . graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . so far , there were no modern &amp; GUI ; programs to visu@@ alize graph@@ ers . the programs that include &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only a few functions . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; the project has set itself the goal to replace these programs by a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a KDE program for watching &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; displays graph with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; Kate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of graphs in &amp; Kate ; mark the graphs and in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ;
menu to open the graphs in &amp; Kate ; to open or the graphs in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; in a &amp; Kate ; -@@ component to open
loading of large graphs ( currently there are problems from about 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to represent more than these knots )
&quot; additional needed software : &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program , which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of graphs are required in detail : &quot;
&quot; the main window shows the opened graphics , each in an own sub@@ window . initially , when you start &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; in this case , the toolbar panel is empty and the ( empty ) list will be opened only the file icon . click on the icon to open the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; files selected , the main window will look like in the lower screenshot : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview in the corner is displayed when the Grap@@ h is bigger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this survey with the context menu or select this position automatically . &quot;
use the mouse wheel ( high and r@@ w without special keys to the left and right of pressed &amp; old ; -@@ button ) ;
the zo@@ oming is restricted in both directions by the factor 10 . below you can see the maximum cl@@ amping of a graphs .
&quot; if the file was changed in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; loaded file from another program , the following window will be displayed : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the graphics want to be re@@ loaded or whether you want to ignore the change , so that later you want to change . if you want to change your decision later , you can set the menu item Settings k@@ graph@@ viewer ; see also . &quot;
&quot; if you open a graph outside a running &amp; k@@ rep@@ viewer ; an instance open , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; c@@ graph@@ viewer ; or the instance you want to represent a sub@@ folder in a sub@@ window of the already running instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option you can permanently save your choice , but also change it with the dialog dialog . &quot;
&quot; during program start , you can open all graphs of your last session . again , you can save your choice both as well as later . &quot;
you can also specify how the graph should be split into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be chosen freely .
&quot; if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graphs are to be used on a page . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled from the respective parts of the graph . &quot;
page show with one on several pages shared with a header line and with another font .
&quot; the page once again gives you the opportunity to set the behaviour when a file was changed on the hard disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a standard behaviour ( automatically re@@ loading or change the changes ) or the program every time . &quot;
&quot; opening the page opening is the opportunity to set the behaviour of &amp; c@@ graph@@ viewer ; you can open a graph outside a running session ( graphs in a new window , or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that each time is asked . &quot;
the site management provides the possibility to set the start @-@ behavior of &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; you can open a standard behaviour ( the files of the last session or not ) or determine where they will be asked for later .
the context menu which usually appears at a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; opens up other possibilities :
here you can choose under different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; Lay@@ out@@ algorithms . the entries as they are described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are :
&quot; &amp; dot ; -@@ algorithm , the standard for judicial graphs . he produces hierarch@@ ical or lam@@ inated depic@@ tions of judicial graphs . the algorithm establishes the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tried to produce as short edge and as a few cant@@ onal cuts . &quot;
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; -@@ algorithm is the standard for odd graphs . it is used in accordance with the spr@@ ing@@ spr@@ ing@@ model . it is used in accordance with the spr@@ ing@@ spr@@ ing@@ model . the Cam@@ ada @-@ Kaw@@ ai @-@ algorithm is the same with statisti@@ c @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm creates for odd graphs a spr@@ ing@@ ed model -@@ layout . he uses the Fru@@ it@@ man Rein@@ gold @-@ He@@ ur@@ istics and includes a multi @-@ smo@@ ker for the treatment of large and g@@ ec@@ lu@@ ster@@ ous graphics .
&quot; the &amp; cir@@ co ; -@@ algorithm supports the node circular along with the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and Kau@@ ff@@ man and meadow , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of several cy@@ c@@ lical structures . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog in which you can specify a layout command . the command should indicate the Graph@@ end@@ at@@ ei as parameters , and the calculated layout of the graphs by st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout , you can change the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ algorithms specific options , or also the graphs with a filter before it is drawn . &quot;
&quot; determined the type of graphs ( directed or un@@ just ) and uses the standard algorithm for the respective type in ( dot ; for judicial , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for odd graphs ) . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is activated , the overview is displayed as it is necessary . otherwise , it is not shown and the positioning menu is in@@ active . &quot;
shows the What is the mouse pointer to . click with this mouse pointer to a &amp; GUI ; -@@ element to get more help to this element ( if available ) .
a list of changes is available under this address and in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the base folder of the source Archives .

the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical localization allows to add GPS coordinates in the metad@@ ata of an image and edit it . the geographical data are stored in the EX@@ IF sampling of the image and the localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical localization provides tools available for pictures geograph@@ ically in spher@@ ical coordinate system , which is used by GPS and Galileo in height , long@@ itu@@ dinal and l@@ ati@@ tudes . &quot;
&quot; to view your images with geographical data , you need a GPS trace as XML @-@ file in the gp@@ x @-@ For@@ mat@@ . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and gp@@ sman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device . &quot;
image Geo@@ graphical localization Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; select the images you want to download in the main window and call the menu on . the top to visual dialog appears then . to load a possible cor@@ relation of time and localization through , you need to load a trace file with GP@@ X file . this file will naturally load the same time in the same locations as the pictures of your camera . &quot;
when the file loaded is loaded a automatic cor@@ relation performed the coordinates in red indicates . GPS trace data is recorded in GMT @-@ time and therefore the camera will be converted with the time zone . this can be done with the time@@ zone . place your camera zone .
the setting for the maximum time deviation is a upper deviation for the GPS @-@ time and camera control . the deviation of the data is combined . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you don &apos;t have any trace data from a place for images you can edit the gp@@ x file manually and add to the pictures . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then all images in this area .
&quot; the options Inter@@ pol@@ eren and difference in minutes can be used if you don &apos;t have appropriate data . if you know that in reality a location difference between camera and GPS is , you can put these limits here and then push the button cord for inter@@ pol@@ ishing . &quot;
&quot; coordinates can be manually set with this dialog . this is useful when you use a number of photos at the same location . as the dialog &apos;s coordinates , you just need to use the button OK to put the data on the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the loc@@ ating can also be found with the displayed map and enlarge . select the relevant region and enlarge , you will always be selected again , until you get an ample accuracy . the height must always be manually selected . the card can be changed between map mode , satellite image and a mixed mode . &quot;

&quot; this module allows you to store images listed below , pictures in the JP@@ EG format , without the usual losses of quality and metad@@ ata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of the loading @-@ free storage it is the file size increases , as no compression of colour information takes place . this can be found e.g. by PN@@ G format . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool to connect your computer to a digital camera .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I teams under k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ org@@ . attention : the participants in this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module Metad@@ ata module currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the mailing list k@@ de imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
&quot; with the import operation of the metad@@ ata module , you can copy data from one image to another . then select the file sel@@ ector dialog with which you want to copy the file image , i.e. the image to copy the metad@@ ata . the data will be copied after you click on the button OK . &quot;
&quot; this function is not working with all formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not in any target format . JP@@ EG is supported by writing . please look in exi@@ v@@ 2 to see which formats are supported . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer Module is a tool to convert a series of images to MPEG video in the form of a slideshow .
&quot; the module MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video , with a defined length , to convert . this module uses the packages M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick . you can also add an audio file to the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slideshow . &quot;
&quot; all images are automatically scal@@ ded to the correct size for the chosen video format . additionally , you can create a background color for the slideshow . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can use the K@@ 3@@ b program . &quot;
you must first choose the images to be packed into MPEG di@@ asch@@ au . after that you can boot the module via extras .
the images selected by you are then en@@ umer@@ ated under image files in the portfolio . there you can also change sor@@ ting of images or the contents of the list .
&quot; after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be chosen from different formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , Sec@@ am or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most probably the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should indicate the time in seconds the image is displayed . the speed of the image will be specified below . a low value creates very sudden , a high against very smooth image change . &quot;
the background color can be set next . in doubt you can let it be black . the name and the path of the created file you can set up under the name of the MPEG output file . keep the extension possible at the end .
&quot; if you specify a audio file under the name of the audio file , this will be integrated into the movie . depending on speed of your computer you can start using the button . depending on the speed of your computer you can now go quickly or in all calm a coffee and enjoy the slideshow if you are back again . &quot;

the printer wiz@@ ard allows you to print several pictures on a sheet of paper together in standard Photo@@ graphs . this is e.@@ g : useful to improve you or to print using the Gimp module for direct expression .
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import and convert your in raw format stored images in one of three formats JP@@ EG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM . &quot;
&quot; the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w of Dave Coff@@ in . an original qu@@ ad of Him is : expect of d@@ cra@@ p not that it creates the same results as the software from your camera . sometimes you get d@@ cra@@ p better results ! &quot;
&quot; first , select the raw file to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w image converter window appears in the mode for a single picture . with the button preview , you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture . &quot;
&quot; you can now re@@ configure the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option will decide whether the camera settings can be used for the white cut . the essential parameters such as gam@@ ma , brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can process the image later on . &quot;
&quot; a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected , so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in R@@ GB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switches has no effect . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and the conver@@ sions result is equal and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JP@@ EG does not use an ind@@ oc@@ ular algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes . &quot;
&quot; the Tagged Image Format , TI@@ FF , maintains all the information of your image and uses the ver@@ lu@@ st@@ free LZ@@ W comp@@ res@@ sing . &quot;
&quot; if you are planning to process your pictures frequently or you later use it further , you should not use the JP@@ EG format before allowing the image quality deteri@@ or@@ ated . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you choose JP@@ EG format , the metad@@ ata used in the raw file are stored in the JP@@ EG file in the 50@@ EG &apos;s information . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted your settings , you can start the conversion button . if you want to cancel this process , you can use the Cancel . &quot;
&quot; the for@@ tification mode allows you to convert different images to once . use this mode , for example , by test on a single picture , which are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; however , the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images . however , you have the option to automatically over@@ write the existing file . this is helpful in a previous attempt . a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion progress has been advanced . &quot;
this module can be used to re@@ comp@@ ress all images in one album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used for ren@@ aming all images of a album . you can use the pre@@ fix , the start @-@ speed and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the use . &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can enlarge the image smaller or enlarge . these are four types of images added :
&quot; proportional ( 1 x in the dimension . ) : normal size change in a dimension . width or height of the image is automatically selected , depending on the image orientation , selected . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . &quot;
proportional ( 2 . ) : size change in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen format .
not proportional : not dis@@ proportion@@ ate change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
&quot; preparation : preparing the image for the photo print . the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the phot@@ op@@ rot@@ ers . the target image , including background size , side @-@ size and background color , is adapted accordingly . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your favorite e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the desired pictures before . more images can be moved to the list of the images below .
&quot; after you have started the module , the images will be displayed with the selected images . over the button images you can add with a file sel@@ ector dialog . for the recently chosen picture , a preview will be shown on the right . &quot;
you can also drag pictures to the photo list and add it to the list of the images you can add .
remove pictures with the button images the selected images are removed from the list of the included pictures .
after you have selected all images you can open with the button OK the new message window of your e @-@ mail client . you just need to add the addresses and subject to the subject . you have to attached here only to the app@@ endi@@ x .
watch out not too many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations for the size of the e @-@ mails e @-@ mails . it might be a good idea to send multiple mails when you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window will be used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and will be used every time until you change it .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . in case you choose Thunder@@ bird , so you have to specify the right path for your installation . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail Service , you need to install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after choosing comments in a attached file , the comments are attached to the images into a text file and attached to the mail . &quot;
PN@@ G format below the menu images file format is not very suitable to use the size of photo files such as TI@@ FF . you should therefore use PN@@ G if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend you the JP@@ EG format .
&quot; if you can choose JP@@ EG format , select the original files in JP@@ EG format , then the original files are added to the associated images . &quot;
&quot; when the process is finished , the window will not be automatically closed to you the stat@@ uses , in search of errors , view . your e @-@ mail program is automatically started at the end . with the button closing , you can get this window t@@ ear ? en . &quot;
after the start@@ up of the module Di@@ asch@@ au a window will be displayed with questions like you want your slideshow . you can choose between the selected and all images of the album .
&quot; the option OpenGL transi@@ tions in the presentation use very elegant image transi@@ tions by OpenGL . however , you need to have a corresponding graphics card , as otherwise the slideshow is very slow . &quot;
the file file names will be displayed that the fil@@ en@@ ame of images in the lower left corner during the presentation will be displayed .
the option loop ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a final loop . you can then drop them manually with Es@@ c ; ab@@ rupt .
the option pictures random@@ ly choose that the images are displayed in a random order . thus it is not used the order of images in the album .
&quot; under delay between the images , the temporary distance between the individual images can be set . 1500 mill@@ is@@ econ@@ ds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition . &quot;
there are more than a dozen transi@@ tions between which you can choose . by chance choose between pictures and other effects .
&quot; during the slideshow , you can access a toolbar on the top left side of the screen . move the mouse into this corner by you . &quot;
&quot; with this tool , you can stop the presentation and start again , to the previous and next picture and stop the slideshow . &quot;
&quot; on the left hand side of the screen , you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ames , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I Module Time &amp; Date , currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I teams under k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ org@@ . attention : the participants in this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module wallpaper is a tool to set an image as a background image for the working surface .
&quot; this module sets up the currently selected picture , depending on the selected option of the sub @-@ menu , as background for your KDE bench . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes , you can see with &amp; photo@@ album ; through this brow@@ ses , see picture . as you can see by comparison with the image , so in persons , places and in the group sampling entries available . &quot;
in the browser window you will see the categories for which you have entered information than you have entered your pictures and videos with notes . additionally there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information to view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course view the current thumb@@ nails .
&quot; if you press the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser is changing . see picture . &quot;
&quot; if you choose another person only the images are displayed , on which both individuals are shown . through this method , you can restrict the number of images shown by a few thousand pictures to a few single pictures . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected all persons , places and other settings , you can see with thumb@@ nails , to view the images of your activity . &quot;
&quot; in the picture every person has the same symbol in front of its name . you can store up with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person a private dock , which is of course also valid for places , keywords and other categories you have defined . see the picture . &quot;
&quot; to view images in addition to the name , select the button that is right outside on the toolbar . this has the advantage that you can display for the current category . this has the advantage that you can display e.g. symbols with images of individuals and at the same time a list of key@@ word ( if you have no suitable pictures ) . &quot;
&quot; you must be able to specify which image for each individual person is to be displayed . now , you will choose an image editor , as shown in the picture . here you can customize the image template according to your wishes and thus choose which part of the image will be displayed or cut . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the entry window enter the entry , you will see a dialog that is very similar to the dialog &apos;s image properties . this dialog can also be seen in the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you enter a string in the field of let@@ tering or description , the circum@@ scri@@ be or descriptions of the images are sear@@ ched for this text , so for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the bottom of the window you can browse all pictures by certain names , as you can see in the picture . here is after pictures , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are pic@@ tured . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you do not like to read hand@@ books , but prefer to try equal functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and take a look at the quick entry of the screenshot and the introductory videos .
&quot; start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , and select in the first dialog box when you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select the menu using the menu entry photo@@ album ; &quot; then , some sample pictures will be loaded and you can sample the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as an integral HTML document to download . &quot;
at the bottom of the main window from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the time bar . one picture of this bar see here : . as the name suggests , this bar shows you date statistics about the pictures in your database . &quot;
the time bar can show you several different intervals . each bar shows then another unit . you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you see a part of a database by showing the bar only 10 @-@ minute sections . &quot;
the time bar can be used in the following ways : you can edit the displayed thumb@@ nails from the database ( if you choose a date you will see the current date of the currently displayed pictures if you navigate to the Preview view .
&quot; you can also select a range of the time bar by pressing the mouse button pressed and mouse over the ruler of the time bar , i.e. the time , drag . if you select an area , you will see the selection down , by clicking on a beam of the time bar . &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; offers you two options available to create HTML web pages with your images ; the one is included in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version described in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version described above the menu file to create files ...
&quot; before HTML pages you need to create some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and finish . in the following each section is described more accurately . &quot;
&quot; first enter the title of the over@@ look and a description , which should contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML example pages see an example of these settings . &quot;
next select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ export file will be created to see the overview page . nutri@@ ent information on export files can be found in .
&quot; finally you can choose which information on the HTML pages are to be displayed . thus , you can avoid that information can be displayed on the viewer . for example , that all pictures are exported . you can therefore not use this setting to hide specific images before certain viewers . &quot;
in this area you can specify how the HTML pages are to look like . most setting possibilities are clear that this is not specifically formulated .
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can adjust different resolutions for the pictures . this , those who have to view your website and possess a monitor that supports maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no longer download the example a resolution of 1600@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewer of your page can change the resolution anytime you have specified . it can therefore load your pictures with lower resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time . if he wants to appear a picture bigger he changes to a higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setup , you place the different folders and the URL fixed where your website is stored . &quot;
&quot; in the best way , choose a basic folder for all your HTML files and for each subsequent sentence a new sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; first of all , you must select the main folder in which all your images will be saved . this folder will automatically be added to you for all future images of the location . here you can choose a folder or one of KDE supported protocol for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your images , you can check if this really are all suitable for viewer . if you choose for the base folder a URL will be started . the URL you will specify here should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will run in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if you do not use the HTML files in the final destination folder , you must manually copy it to the final destination folder . this is not the sub@@ folder of the files , but the basic folder in which all sub@@ folders . &quot;
&quot; the settings described above have all three on basic folders or URLs . in these will be set up a sub @-@ folder , whose name you can specify in output folder . &quot;
&quot; if you are searching for a family party , a meeting at the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can of course write an HTML page for viewing the images . you can of course write an HTML page for viewing the images , then you have to do with &amp; photo@@ album ; this work is not even once again . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others to your database . the features are used with external and imported . &quot;
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ whether the images are stored in the file or if the file is only a short@@ cut to pictures . the advantage all images can be saved into the file and that you can share this file as independent . the obvious disadvantage is the file size .
&quot; you can create a .@@ k@@ in file either directly from the menu File Export ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with a HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ in file searches the pictures in two different ways . firstly , the images are not found in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . this is of course only possible if you created your .@@ k@@ im file by using HTML export . &quot;
the following is described by the dialog for the export of images that allows you to export via the menu file .
&quot; the most important option of this dialog is , whether it should act for internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are the following three options available : &quot;
&quot; in the option Manual in the vicinity of the .@@ k@@ im file , you must copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
with the option automatic to copy the .@@ k@@ in file copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the images will be automatically copied for you .
&quot; .@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most pictures have already been comp@@ ressed with JP@@ EG and the XML file itself is very small , it usually doesn &apos;t want to comp@@ ress the files , just select the export file to comp@@ ress it . &quot;
&quot; the last option of this site is maximum image size limit . if you want to send your friends pictures , as the .@@ k@@ im file else would be very big . here you can limit the size by saying that every picture is at most 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
&quot; select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu File , select &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in . &quot;
&quot; the wiz@@ ard for import@@ ing consists of four steps . first , you must select which images you want to import , then in which folder the import images are to be copied . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you are entering the category persons who are in your database . therefore , you are in the third dialog window , which are to be imported in the third dialog , and what categories are to be imported in your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can select the categories of imported file with the categories of your current database . an example for this can be seen in the picture . &quot;
&quot; it must be easy to browse images and watch : when you look at pictures , you often want to view images of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend to discover , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is pic@@ tured . &quot;
&quot; in this hand@@ book you will find the various steps from ( 1 ) Cre@@ ate the information about your images , about ( 2 ) the browsing and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced themes and custom@@ isation options . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ album has been started as a program to managing your pictures . however , it has been extended and now taking care of your videos . in many places in this hand@@ book will also talk about paintings , but often this also includes videos with one . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; saves all his information in the index.@@ x@@ ml in the top &quot; &quot; index.@@ x@@ ml &quot; &quot; folder . this is an easy XML file that you can copy on a disk or re@@ visions in the CV@@ S , where they would like to secure . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you notice the folder where your images are stored and used in future star@@ ters automatically . if you want to start another database in &amp; photo@@ album , so you can launch a different folder with images , you can boot &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with the option -@@ c . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / pictures / index.@@ x@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; using the menu entry settings k@@ photo@@ album , setup ... get to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual , you will find the various settings options . &quot;
&quot; to the left you will see six different symbols , with which you can preview the Preview and the options for viewing the viewer . for each setting there is a detailed help to access the F1 key and a click on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; as you describe , as you can create different properties , e.g. people , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as items , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; click on the dialog , which is used to edit already existing groups . for each existing group you can select a let@@ tering and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in paragraph , sub@@ categories already mentioned . in the dialog options you can create complete membership groups , i.e. all members of a group at a time set in a group instead of all groups of one of the membership . &quot;
&quot; in view you can see the settings options available to you for organizing the membership options . with the above list , you can choose the category you want to configure the category you want . in the left of Fen@@ st@@ ables , a list of the current category and in the right is a list of categories . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is his module with other graphics applications , such as digi@@ ti@@ y and G@@ wen@@ view . this module is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . nutrition information can be found on the homepage of Ki@@ pi . &quot;
&quot; the modules can be called via the menu modules . the modules can be called and are not described in this manual , as they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; but these modules have a help page , which you can access via the modules themselves . &quot;
&quot; since the modules of multiple applications are shared with each other , it can be tested that the modules with &amp; photo@@ album ; demo database , you can either view the command line with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ demo &lt; user@@ file \ &gt; or via the menu Help . say not , I could not have been war@@ ned ! &quot;
&quot; the applications that shared the modules via K@@ IP@@ I , are very different , thereby it may be that some modules with &amp; sound album ; do not work . this is the disadvantage when you share functions with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the main difference between &amp; photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is an album simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this type of order not supported , simul@@ ates the order after albums , so that you can use the functions with &amp; photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; here , simul@@ ates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which simply corresponds to the current view , so all images that show you the picture @-@ show at the moment . &quot;
&quot; besides the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , the modules also has to commit a list of albums . here goes &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows : &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser displays the content of a category , for example , all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will be the category that you have specified in the setup dialog as a category for virtual albums , then for example , if you use the category , then whether you have been selected to the view and pass this module . &quot;
since some modules have been compatible with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not compatible can you remove it from the list of modules . click on the dialog box and select modules that are to be loaded in the range module .
&quot; on the picture you see an example of a starting screen , once you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures . &quot;
&quot; as you are used by any other KDE application , you can see at the top of a menu and a toolbar . under the toolbar you can browse the window , so you will not find information about your pictures , now please click on this window to show you an overview with all available images . &quot;
&quot; one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to see any picture with notes . this includes information about the persons who have been recorded on the picture , where the picture was taken either individually or for a larger number of pictures specific notes at the same time . if for example , on all pictures of Jes@@ per , and all pictures were recorded in Copenhagen . &quot;
&quot; all these notes can be used for the search and browsing , as you can read in the section , if you want to see these notes if you use the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; see three lists with a text box by setting people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; because you will always use it when you enter information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; following idea lies the shif@@ ting of images within the list : if you have for example a family party and are shown on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons , you can find that the names used for the above are to be found more quickly and classi@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to receive a alphabe@@ tical list , click on the icon for sor@@ ting after date on the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected any comments for each image , you might want to edit all selected images and edit these pictures with notes . click in this case simply click on the image and back @-@ buttons that are under the preview of the image to the right . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you have several pictures , e.g. with the same person , then it can be convenient to mark all these images and to use the menu item added items to once with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . moreover , San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you see a browser window of the United States as an over@@ group . to show you that it is an over@@ group , a special symbol is shown . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu of the picture @-@ dial@@ ogs , it is possible to add an entry into an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also set an entry into a category and set it in order to make this one sub@@ category of this entry . attention , this requires just your category alphabe@@ tically sort . see this . &quot;
&quot; you can move the individual elements of the an@@ ec@@ o@@ dial@@ ogs by clicking the corp@@ ses , which form the upper edge of the frame , click and move . you can also make a separate window by drag it outside the window . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted the appearance of the window so to your needs , you are satisfied with the settings , click on the button options ... , which offers you the opportunity to save the current structure and appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also leave a frame complete . if you would like to see this window later , use the button options ... and then window a / hide . this process can be seen in the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the entry pictures in the browser , you will find an overview with pres@@ cient of the currently selected images , or any images in case you have no filter here . you can see the size of the thumb@@ nails , by simply drag the mouse with the middle mouse button , configure . try it easily . &quot;
&quot; if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image will be arranged as a background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; if you click on an image , this in image is displayed . if you have not opened a window with an image viewed , a new indicator is created . &quot;
you can also delete pictures in the image show . just choose the appropriate pictures you want to delete and select either the drop button or select the menu Edit selection . now you will see the window that you can see in the picture .
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can also use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for example , you can also record the pictures anywhere , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . in the picture you can see the view from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required pictures can be loaded from the hard disk . &quot;
&quot; images , where the right upper corner is cut off , are not saved on the hard disk . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , however , the thumb@@ nails are present , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also preview these images with the image viewed . &quot;
&quot; as you see , this function requires that you would like files from the folders and copy it again . if you do not want to avoid the inser@@ tion of the concerned CD . if you want to avoid a larger disk , please buy a larger hard drive to save all images on it . &quot;
&quot; in the menu , you will find a sub@@ menu with the name of privacy . if you would like a little more privacy , you would like to choose the pictures in the menu privacy . alternatively , you can also see all pictures that may see your small sister , control and menu entry All except current view . &quot;
&quot; in order to make sure what images are hidden in the case of the fall , simply select the menu item your small sister , allowing you to drag the menu entry pictures , allowing all the images you want to be locked . if you want to see the pictures again , click on sp@@ las@@ hing . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to set a password that has to be entered into the image . to set this password , simply select password in the menu privacy . &quot;
&quot; please keep in mind that this picture protection is by no means very safe . for one finds all images on the hard disk and to the other one can easily read or delete this type of password protection , which are not very familiar with &amp; photo@@ album ; not very familiar with a look at private pictures . &quot;
the reason why you can manage all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and hours over hours to describe it is of course that you want to consider it sometime . for this reason you have a picture _ and video regarded . this can be viewed from the Preview , as described in . &quot;
&quot; see the viewer you can see in . he naturally shows the picture , but additional all the information you have entered via picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it made , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the Info@@ box you want to see on the upper part of the image you want to see , so you can configure this easily with your mouse and you can also configure which information displayed and whether all of these options are displayed in the viewer . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer . this then appears context menu you can see below . &quot;
&quot; some words in the Info@@ box are underlined . if you click here , see , matching entries to this page . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you were persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have loaded multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them and switch back by reading the keys picture high and image . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ ei@@ c and end . these functions are also accessible from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as a slideshow . how often it loads a new image after a few seconds . how often it can press a new image by pressing the C@@ trl key and Plus or minus . it will be started with the C@@ trl key . &quot;
a very useful ability of the viewer from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in this mode it is used in full screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input button to switch in full screen mode and back .
if you use the viewer you can enter into the picture in and out zo@@ oming . with the minus button you can switch off into the middle of the picture . shows how a zoom rec@@ t@@ angle is marked and shows the result of the zoom .
&quot; with the point button you can reset your zoom , so that the image does not display zo@@ om@@ t . with the uni@@ formity makes the zoom , so that every pixels on screen screen is equivalent to the screen of the image . &quot;
note that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ s work with videos that are in and challenging with the Plus@@ - and Minu@@ ties .
&quot; with the speed functions from the context menu , you can turn the image . this does not work with videos . you can also get notes to the actual picture with the menu item notes from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when you look at pictures , you can find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture . at the moment you can view the check and configuration dialog of the image to specify these names . however , you will only consider the picture to mark and see more images . &quot;
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to see the pictures on paper . to see what photos you want , you can select the viewer with the images and select it as good or bad while you see one by one . &quot;
&quot; for the two examples above gives you the viewers the possibility to view photos with characteristics , while you see them . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can see a characteristic that you press the appropriate letters . in view a picture , where the features A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; once you have some features set on your pictures , this is available to you in the browser . so you can see all the pictures you edit , print or whatever you choose to copy , just below . afterwards , you can use a module to copy the selected images on a CD or what you just want to do . &quot;
&quot; categories and special features can be displayed in the thumb@@ nails , then you can add features to the pictures by simply hit the letters for the watch , after the picture was selected . this can be seen here : &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on an image . for this case allows you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the picture to paint .
&quot; the room will not be saved with the picture , but in the database . on the way you can un@@ fold your mind . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can see a picture on the painted picture . in order to turn the painting mode from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . to end the painting , you simply press the cross in the toolbar above the window . &quot;
&quot; to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you need to complete the application of the program &amp; Pov@@ ray ; not fully control , but the documentation on &amp; Pov@@ ray ; should you necessarily read and understood . &quot;
&quot; in the tube tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the properties properties , and the object in the wire mod@@ ell@@ - views are shown . &quot;
&quot; you can also select multiple objects at the same time , but not the sub@@ object of an already selected object , as all sub@@ objects are already selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position to insert the object and click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry into the menu . &quot;
&quot; there are multiple possible positions , the following men@@ op@@ ed menu appears , so that you can choose the correct position : &quot;
&quot; with delet@@ ing either from the menu bar , edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can remove selected objects from the scene . &quot;
&quot; if you have modified properties , click on to apply these changes . do you have un@@ vei@@ ling values , a message is shown with a bug description . then you can click the input error messages and click the changes to break down . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the path to &amp; Pov@@ ray , you can enter the &amp; Pov@@ ray dialog , you can call the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; -@@ reference to the displayed object with the help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user &apos;s documentation to use this property . if these documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.5 has already included the user &apos;s documentation . &quot;
&quot; edit a text or part of a text , you can preview a preview in the peculi@@ ar view . &quot;
&quot; press preview in the peculi@@ ar view and a small example of the scene is retri@@ eved with the chosen text@@ book , even if you want a sub@@ ordin@@ ated element ( for example a text is selected within a text@@ ur @-@ map and not the entire texture map ) , cross @-@ line locally . &quot;
the screenshot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these check@@ points with the mouse button and thus change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is chosen , the check@@ points will disappear and there will be a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the centre for sc@@ aling and rotation than the position for shif@@ ting . you can change the shif@@ ting by drag@@ ging with the mouse inside the whole window . &quot;
&quot; each object has a wi@@ re@@ speed model . you can specify this value relative to the level of view of the higher object or as absolute value . objects are only displayed when they are selected or their view @-@ level of view , smaller or equal in the toolbar of the scene . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window @-@ order as a preference . the lens tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
&quot; if you do not like the standard window order or if you need a different arrangement , you can save them to any number . you can also save multiple shut@@ ters and easily switch between different arrangements . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window on or among an existing view , drag the drop to the top or bottom of a view . a rec@@ t@@ angle then shows the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the drop to the right or left side of a view . the new view will be ancho@@ red at the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to arrange several views on one another , drag the drop in the middle of another view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the box card at the top in the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window order are p@@ ending views : views that are not ancho@@ red in the main window , drag the drop to the desktop or click on the small to the left upper arrow at the bottom bar . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the mountain bar . to prevent the sc@@ arf , click on the small square between arrow and cross . &quot;
&quot; you can insert additional views in the main window . in the menu View , you will find entries for any type of views . new views are p@@ ending , you can anchor them to any point . &quot;
you can save the current window below and save a dialog box . it will be a dialog box where you can save the window under an existing or new name .
&quot; if you have created a scene , you can ren@@ dering it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to ren@@ dering , this program has to be properly installed . as this manual was written in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 not supported . &quot;
&quot; to ren@@ dering the current scene , click on the icon to ren@@ dering the icon in the toolbar or select the menu item scene . &quot;
&quot; a R@@ ender mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Pov@@ ray ; s ini @-@ files . he determines the image size and quality of ren@@ dering . if you insert a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many re@@ ender modes , from a fast preview of to complete images in the highest quality . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the icon of The R@@ ender settings in the toolbar or in the menu View R@@ ender Mo@@ di ... , the following dialog will be opened : &quot;
&quot; each disp@@ enser mode has a name . you can fill in any name , but it is a name that can be seen in the mode of the mode . &quot;
in the box size you can enter the width and height of the framed image . if you want to ren@@ dering a small area of the image you select the cross @-@ section sub@@ section and enter the image section for ren@@ dering into the input fields .
in the field of combination quality you can select the characteristics which uses &amp; Pov@@ ray ; to ren@@ dering a model with complex diff@@ user Re@@ flexi@@ ons illumination . a detailed description of the R@@ ender properties can be found in the user &apos;s manual on &amp; Pov@@ ray ;
&quot; when a picture with only one string is dispos@@ ed , there are often different errors in cur@@ ves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed when they are in the representation smaller than one pixel . this effect is called Ali@@ asing . &quot;
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to decrease the influence of these mistakes . in general see pictures with this property better .
&quot; if you switch anti @-@ ali@@ asing , comp@@ uted and connects &amp; Pov@@ ray ; more than a beam per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling . &quot;
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super sampling . as a standard is adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; re@@ cur@@ ate because every pixels is always split up and adap@@ tive because the records depends on the calculated colour values .
&quot; if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray passes a beam per pixel . if the difference between colour values passes on the neighboring pixels , a grid of 4x@@ 4 additional points will be calculated , at a low value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional bl@@ asting per pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then : &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between colour values over@@ stepp@@ ing the pre@@ determined shaft then the pixels will be monitored individually and will be tested on further maintenance . the maximum depth of records can be adjusted as well .
&quot; another option to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the creation of smoking for the beam process , called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you switch J@@ itter@@ ing , modified &amp; Pov@@ ray ; the beams to avoid a tiny amount to avoid regular sample . &quot;
&quot; the last setting for quality of the ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection , this is an experimental property of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; it takes a long time to calculate the diff@@ use of light reflection . it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property . &quot;
on this map card you can set whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixels is then transparent when the corresponding rays have not made an object .
opens a new window to display the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; if &amp; Pov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly ended , you can find the reason for it here . &quot;
to import a &amp; Pov@@ ray ; select the menu entry file Im@@ ported ... and choose a file in the dialog box .
&quot; currently , &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er now supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; still does not appear the full command of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; when import@@ ing error messages or war@@ nings , a dialog window shows a list of all messages . &quot;
if you do not support HTML text in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import this source text between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ End .
&quot; you can drag objects from the object tree in the editor to export the source text for &amp; Pov@@ ray ; it adds the source text of the object into the text . to import objects in the Editor , simply highlight the source text in the editor and drag it to the layout . &quot;
with copying and paste into &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can insert source text for &amp; Pov@@ ray ; also in your editor .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called if &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ dering . usually this Pov@@ ray or x @-@ Pov@@ ray .
&quot; click on assistance in the peculi@@ ar view , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; user @-@ documentation of the displayed object . place the path to your documentation and release . currently , the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 will be supported . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Pov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example , al@@ ph@@ ur data ) in the paths to the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; libraries . if you enter files that do not appear in the folder of the scene , you &apos;ll also have to enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used . &quot;
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for display the selected objects .
the color for the check@@ points . the second color is used for the display of the selected control points .
the colour of the rec@@ t@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type mark .
you can set the object @-@ out of the points on the R@@ aster in the context menu of the wire model views . you can adjust the R@@ aster separately for shi@@ fts , Skal@@ ings and rot@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; larger values arise a more accurate wire model and thus a better stit@@ uting for the objects displayed , but require more time to ren@@ dering . for some objects such as the ball can set the detail stage for two directions . &quot;
&quot; if you cross the high level of detail for extended proj@@ ections , all the wire data views are used . extended proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions to the perspective and the sen@@ k@@ right proj@@ ections . this property produces a better approach to proj@@ ections , but requires more time to ren@@ dering . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for wall , a wall is mounted behind the objects . the wall is represented in a box pattern from two adjustable colors . &quot;
if you des@@ ti@@ fy ground there is a floor below the objects cut down . the floor is represented in a box pattern from two adjustable colors .
if you activate cant@@ ank@@ ering activate the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method used for ren@@ dering the scenes . the values for depth and fl@@ yers can be set . more detailed information about the parameters can be found in the section of R@@ ender modes .
&quot; on this page you can change existing shut@@ ters or create new window frames . in the section pane , as you can create windows and store them . &quot;
the Com@@ bin@@ ational field standard window @-@ window : displays all existing shut@@ ters . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the chosen window order at the start of the program .
the list of existing shut@@ ters displays all existing shut@@ ters . a new arrangement can be added with the button Add and delete a selected order with the button .
each window order is identified by the name . the name must be un@@ ambiguous and must not be empty .
the list below shows all views for the chosen window order . new views can be added with the button Add and delete selected views with the button .
&quot; the position of the new window . with New column , you can create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with box card , you get the window under the available window , with box card , the view does not ancho@@ red in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you just have &amp; Pov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and now you would like to follow more detailed knowledge of the two programs . if you can follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultim@@ ative but simple scene , among ches very popular : a sphere on one plane . &quot;
&quot; but you should carefully consider the following war@@ nings , before you complain that you can get as a result of just a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you do not set any camera , no rules can be applied to ren@@ dering as a result you receive a black image . &quot;
&quot; when you insert no light sources , your entire scene is in the dark and you will only receive a black image . &quot;
&quot; if you have everything error @-@ free , take a look at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following pres@@ et window : &quot;
&quot; take a little time to get to know the menus and existing symbols of the toolbar . read the documentation , so that you can expect an adequate idea of what you can expect from this program . &quot;
&quot; you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their applications . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you first need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu entry edit . so you now have a scene without objects . &quot;
the wire model view shows how the camera considers the whole scene which you generate . in particular note that in the fourth dragon model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the perspective of the camera . this shows you the result of the ren@@ der@@ ns of the scene .
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , see the contents of the view properties tab , in which the various parameters of the camera find . in the user &apos;s documentation to &amp; Pov@@ ray ; find more details . &quot;
&quot; you have nothing to change the basic settings of the camera , this is later instructions reserved , but note that the camera in view check@@ points can change . simply click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location . &quot;
&quot; if you press the button , the wire model views and the object , change immediately according to these settings . as a result they see here the scene from the point of view of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many possibilities to create the ground for the scene . you could add for example a Qu@@ ader ( inser@@ ting body Qu@@ ader ) and the size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is an in@@ compreh@@ en@@ sible method of solving this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually offers an easier possibility . you can use an infinite level as floor :
&quot; a good advice : select the level in the rug tree , change the name and then hit the button . in the object , the new name will be displayed immediately . &quot;
&quot; the Wi@@ re@@ model view also shows the plain , even though at the moment only as a limited level . if you ren@@ dering the scene , the level extends to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; if you can see the Object tree exactly , you will find that you click on the icon + in front of the object . in this case you will see the various parameters of the object . in this case you will see only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , change also the possible settings in the view of the properties tab . &quot;
&quot; in this scene you should move the ground to exercise a unit under the horizontal line , just to get acquainted with some of these parameters . select shift and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; only choose the ground to set its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose a bit at the moment . &quot;
&quot; in both cases a dialogue , where you can choose how the object is to be inserted . please select the object in the property size ( name = floor pigment ) , with a click on the button preview you see how the pigment now looks . &quot;
&quot; of course , the preview of the pig@@ ments feature only a matt made material , because you can only enter settings for the pig@@ ments . therefore , you will always remember the colours for pig@@ ments . also , there are many possibilities , but now take the easiest . &quot;
&quot; if you do not look at the thumb@@ nails , then click on the button , then click on the button and then call the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the ground is now set right now . if you want to ren@@ dering your picture with a click on the icon , you should get the following results : &quot;
&quot; of course , that &apos;s not the color . you have to have more settings needed . in the color list you need to enter two new attributes , called the entry color list . then edit this entry twice ( you can also do it frequently , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
&quot; in the corner tree jed@@ es@@ times , and change the colors in the view of the properties tab : &quot;
&quot; this step should you already be able to run out , since you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you should already understand the ball is just as easy as the floor : &quot;
&quot; in the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings . put the ball in contact with the ground : on 1 ( do not forget the p@@ entry or the button ) , so the sphere would flo@@ cked down on the ground as you move the ground down to a unit down . &quot;
&quot; of course , ren@@ dering the ren@@ ders now y@@ ields a strange result : as previously seen , the ball @-@ surface like a matt black material . put in the following step an appropriate material . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material now . like the ground , you give the ball a pig@@ ment as a color : &quot;
&quot; choose the property object and change the name for example in sphere Pig@@ ment . click on sphere Pig@@ ment , then dial plain , and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; but you can achieve more interesting effects , if you take the time to set some finish properties : &quot;
then change the values as shown in the following screens and click on An@@ gle or press Enter .
&quot; the settings shine @-@ Eff@@ ect and Refl@@ ection are already partially good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrom@@ ed finishes , even if metal : not selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of it , which offers you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; hopefully you have already learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ tr@@ ay@@ cing is a rar@@ ity method to generate a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
&quot; when you trac@@ ed a scene ray@@ trac@@ es , the ren@@ derer off the perspective of the be@@ holder ( i.e. from the camera , which affect the scenes in the scene and how atmospheric effects are on the scene . so the scene has to be pixel for pixels . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you will see nothing without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you see the scene . without a light source you also see nothing , the picture is simple . obviously you need any scene that should be rendered to some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
in the usual file dialog you can choose your file . Pov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the standard file dialog you can select a file that you have previously made with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; created
&quot; whenever you open a new model , the file will be inserted in this sub@@ menu and replaced the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already stored the model , it will be stored under the same name . it is a new file , you must enter a name and disk space . &quot;
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are rejected .
&quot; this menu entry allows you to only select , if you have not stored stored changes in the scene . &quot;
repeat the last und@@ esi@@ ded command . this menu entry allows you to only select if you have copies machining .
saves the current window order and opens a dialog in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing arrangement .
&quot; in this menu you will find options for setting up &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , the short@@ cuts and the standard behavior . &quot;
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can modify this option pres@@ et shor@@ ts for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; change or add new ones .
opens a dialog to set up the toolbar . you can add and remove with this option tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; commands and remove commands .
&quot; a dump map is a way to pre@@ dat@@ able finishes , without having to mod@@ ulate any b@@ ump on the surface individually and without change the geomet@@ rical form of the object itself . &quot;
it is common that use the same file for a dump map as well as for a Text@@ ur @-@ map .
basics are simple geomet@@ rical shapes that you can use as components : very complex 3D models are generated from do@@ z@@ ens or even hundreds of this basic body . these models are then further processed to give them a realistic appearance .
a Text@@ ur @-@ map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel based using an image file as a color card .
&quot; &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable image , and a browser . the application has a file browser , in which you can choose pictures to display . &quot;
images can be displayed either in an own window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very easy . the file browser lists files that you can view with clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the button Return .
you can set whether every image is to be displayed in an own window or whether all images may be used to use the same window .
&quot; if you are searching for a specific file , just tap the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small entrance area appears in the lower right corner . if a pass@@ ame fil@@ en@@ ame appears , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the entry field by pressing return or &amp; Es@@ c ; &quot;
&quot; in dialogue - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; there are five map maps . in three of them , general and editing and slideshow , you can set up the working method of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; set in the two others , short @-@ commands for the browser , can be specified the short@@ cuts for the respective window . &quot;
&quot; if this is selected , then the pictures are open in full screen mode . if the picture is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the sco@@ re@@ board is filled with the background color that you can move further down . default is no full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; this point is activated , loads &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; already look at the next picture in the folder , while you want to view the current image . this reduces the delay when you choose the next image , and is particularly suitable for a slideshow . &quot;
with this option saves &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the end the name of the last opened folder . when next start opens up &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored beams to select a background color . this is used in to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in the window mode the window is bigger than the image is also filled here with the selected color .
&quot; you can set up &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show , so that only some of the data types can be displayed , which the program can also be depic@@ ted . &quot;
with this option it is enlarged for large pictures the display window on the full screen . this option is switched as default .
lays whether the slideshow with the first image in the folder or with the selected picture is supposed to start .
the time span between the change of change in a slideshow . to change the value you can use a new value into the input field or the small arrows right next to the entry field . the pres@@ et is 3 seconds .
&quot; the number of re@@ peti@@ tions . is this value to 0 , the slideshow is repeated until it will be cancelled from the user . to change the value , you can use a new value into the input field or the small arrows right next to the entry field . the pres@@ et is 1 . &quot;
change here the ke@@ yst@@ er for the different modes of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the box @-@ card short @-@ command for the display and short @-@ command for the browser .
&quot; with this option , you can switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in one window . &quot;

&quot; to view an image , the user can start only a pre@@ f@@ can and then start the scanning range for the final scan . the pre @-@ release can be started by the Preview button . &quot;
to select the image to better select the user into the image and out of the current selection out zo@@ oming . it can also adjust the zoom also so that the complete preview of the window fits .
if the picture was selected then the final image can be read with the scan button .
&quot; if in front of saving a preview in settings is selected , then the image is displayed in a pad@@ lock icon , as shown below , then the picture is stored and shot ? en leads to a desc@@ ending and you will return to the main window . &quot;
&quot; by the button settings , the ep@@ onymous dialog is opened in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot;
&quot; the user can see the picture if desired , before stor@@ ing . in this case , the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview of the user is not desired , then the option must be chosen . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows them to choose the way like &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; pictures saves the dialog to save each image . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite , this automatically opens with a general name in a previously defined folder , then you will be saving without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; this setting defines where the images are stored in the option stor@@ ing without a fil@@ en@@ ame , then this folder will be used as default for dialog . the default value is your home directory , and you can change this with the button ... &quot;
&quot; this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the automatically storage images and is also the proposed name for the image in dialogue to store . the automatically stored image gets a numer@@ ical bre@@ ix of each time , when a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers . &quot;
&quot; the user can customize the image quality . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if select the image quality is not selected , then the default value is used by Q@@ t . &quot;
the button help starts the KDE help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; -@@ hand@@ book . the button About starts the KDE About -@@ dialog for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; the button settings displays the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to finish &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is under the GPL and the lib@@ ks@@ ane library is used by &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; used under L@@ GPL . attention : li@@ bs@@ ane is under the GPL with an exception .
&quot; &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; uses just like all other programs ke@@ yst@@ ok . below you can set a list of this p@@ endant and its function . the global key short@@ cut , you can set up , by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and select short command ... select ... &quot;
you may set up available multimedia buttons so that they work as &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; this will make your keyboard to the &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; control centre .
&quot; the D@@ CO@@ P interface of AM@@ AR@@ OK has many general functions which are mostly used in other KDE programs . this section consists of six parts and should describe the D@@ CO@@ P features of collection , context @-@ browser , player , playlist , play@@ lists and scripts . an example set up for the D@@ CO@@ P function . &quot;
AM@@ AR@@ OK supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition AM@@ AR@@ OK also has some own command lines .
&quot; you should give the user a refund if the script can not be carried out due to a lack of depen@@ dency . please check in your script whether all required modules are available and use col@@ dialog , so that the user does not run . &quot;
BE@@ G@@ IN &apos; Kor@@ un@@ dum &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Er@@ ror error = &apos; Kor@@ un@@ dum ( KDE bind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bind@@ ings v@@ 3.4 is fighting for this script . &apos; &apos; dialog &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit
in the folder scripts / templates you will find a lot of template files in many different languages . you can simply use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply determine the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy .
&quot; with the help of D@@ CO@@ P you can exchange your scripts with AM@@ AR@@ OK and AM@@ AR@@ OK . the simpl@@ est way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p , which should contain any KDE installation . &quot;
most scrip@@ ting languages allow the execute of external programs and commands . in this way the function ex@@ ec ( ) is usually used . this way can d@@ co@@ p &gt; relatively easy to be called . here is an example in Python :
&quot; &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; sending noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this reason the script should be monitored continuously monitoring and acting accordingly to events . of course , a script should also ignore when there is no use for it . &quot;
&quot; configure the script to display the device dialog . to save the stor@@ ing and loading of the furniture . if a script is started , AM@@ AR@@ OK will set the work@@ places to the folder where all data should be stored . &quot;
tr@@ ack@@ Change sign@@ aled that a new piece is played . the script could be played and eg ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions further information about the new piece ( for example the metad@@ ata or the length ) .
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume indicates a change of volume . the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100 .
&quot; custom@@ ization : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le , un@@ folded the path to the selected files of the playlist , if a user @-@ defined menu entry can also be used to remove the script using an own entry , one can use the D@@ CO@@ P @-@ function d@@ co@@ p AM@@ AR@@ OK script and remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Menu@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu item ) . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; it ends , or if the user stops a script , sends &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M sends to the script . this signal should be processed to do such as re@@ fraction , e.g. the saving of data or configuration settings . &quot;
Amar@@ oks script can also install script packages that have downloaded the user &amp; e.g. ; such packages are basically normal t@@ ar @-@ archive ( .@@ t@@ ar ) which can optionally be comp@@ ressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ b@@ z@@ 2 ) that the user can clearly identify the archive as AM@@ AR@@ OK script package .
&quot; &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the Ex@@ tended script . for this reason , you should ren@@ ame your script packages right . &quot;
&quot; the main cri@@ pts must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining to lad@@ der modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar @-@ parameter -@@ p to obtain the file right : &quot;
&quot; when your script is finished , you can un@@ loading it at www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and use the link to the wi@@ ki script page from &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; add the category AM@@ AR@@ OK ; script script . &quot;
&quot; &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; and AM@@ AR@@ OK ; has many useful and powerful functions , and is nevertheless surprisingly simple to use . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK , you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus . perhaps you only look for a very specific titles from thousand in your collection . with &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK , &apos; s collection browser and the quick search will find you the piece within seconds . &quot;
&quot; maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which you want to hear ? then the playlist is still difficult for you . and if the decision is still difficult , select dynamic mode and the intelligent play@@ lists automatically choose the right music according to certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ AR@@ OK has excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many gener@@ ic USB devices . besides , many different audio systems can be used to listen to the most advanced audio player . AM@@ AR@@ OK is intelligent , sexy and chic - exactly the right to re@@ discover your music ! &quot;
&quot; usually , one has to enter the basic folder of the AM@@ AR@@ OK sources , to compile and install AM@@ AR@@ OK button : &quot;
&quot; since &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake use , you should compile the compile no difficulties . if you encounter problems , please report it in the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists . &quot;
&quot; &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; has like most applications , some options that can activate or disable the configure script using the configure script or disable them . this is a list of available options . &quot;
&quot; for some of the comp@@ iling options , certain depen@@ dencies must be fulfilled so that they can be used . details can be found in the section system requirements . &quot;
&quot; activated de@@ bug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK , you should full use full . &quot;
&amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; can be set up without trouble using the furniture dialog . the furniture dialog has several box @-@ cards to set up the various functions of &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK .
&quot; player window display the player window in addition to the playlist , or off . if the option is switched off , the playlist window will be sh@@ own@@ .@@ t@@ J@@ K ) . &quot;
voting bar@@ ometer use : this feature is only available if &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar was compiled . the option switches the experimental function of the voting bar@@ ometer .
voting full : this feature is only available if &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar was compiled . this is the used colour scheme for the voting bar@@ ometer .
voting files placed on the music files : this feature is only available if &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar are stored . if this setting is activated . log files in the Settings folder of &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; saved ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / AM@@ AR@@ OK / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
&quot; external browser : lets you choose which browser is required by &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK , if a browser is needed . &quot;
&quot; other browsers : here you can specify the path to a different browser , which is not listed in the list . &quot;
playlist when stor@@ ing saving you save the current playlist automatically during the finish of &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK . activate this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the running playlist when you don &apos;t want to lose .
&quot; relative paths for manually stored playlist : if you activate this setting , it is used &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , use the absolute position of music files . &quot;
updates can be visible in the piece of quantities that the play@@ lists are open up / ab@@ rol@@ lt to keep the current piece always in the visible window .
&quot; in exchange change to the context @-@ browser , automatically displays the context @-@ browser as soon as the next piece is played . &quot;
in the section picture you can customize &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; s appearance can be adjusted . the section is divided into three parts sub@@ part .
in the fonts section you can use the use of different fonts in &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK . you can select fonts for the following section : play@@ lists window , player windows and context @-@ browser . press to select ... so you can choose a font type from the selection dialog . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of custom color scheme , you have the tor@@ al of choice and can specify a separate colour scheme . use the below color component for front and background color . &quot;
&quot; continuing to continue with the start , that &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; after the program start playing the playback automatically with the piece on the spot , with which it was stopped during the last inspection . &quot;
the sub@@ window on @-@ screen display allows you to switch the set @-@ off of the O@@ SD . if you are using @-@ screen display is to display a preview of the O@@ SD and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview .
the first option is the font . click on select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the kreu@@ z shadow means that the text is sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
&quot; own colors will give you the opportunity to adjust the O@@ SD colors for writing and background . one click on the color areas opens the dialog to color choice . if proper colors do not use , the pres@@ et &amp; k@@ le ; colors are used . &quot;
&quot; the input field display shows the text shown in the O@@ SD . by entering the size box , the O@@ SD can be adjusted to your own needs . below you will find a list of available slots and what they mean . &quot;
the option screen is intended for X@@ ati@@ ama users . this allows you to specify on which screen a multi @-@ monitor monitor has to appear the O@@ SD .
the card @-@ card audio @-@ output can be selected to select an audio driver from the selection box . some drivers will enable further settings in this map card .
the map card collection is used for setting up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and the type of database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folder you can browse the folder , the &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; according to music files , select the junction box next to his name . this section also contains an@@ kreu@@ z areas to adjust how to use the selected folders . &quot;
&quot; sub @-@ folder , search : this means that &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; both the crossed as well as their sub@@ folders according to music is described . &quot;
changes : allows &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; to monitor selected folders on changes ( e.g. if music files added or deleted ) . moreover an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
&quot; play@@ lists : causes , that &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; all found play@@ lists in your collection folder ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection will appear later in the play@@ lists . &quot;
&quot; the part of the database database is used for selecting a database for the collection . the Com@@ bin@@ ational field driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ ql , another set up in the sub @-@ window My@@ S@@ ql is necessary . &quot;
&quot; the My@@ S@@ ql setup is used for inser@@ ting the database for &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK . under calcul@@ ators , the machine is entered into Port : the network port is available under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name , to which the connection is produced . &quot;
use user name : and password : to enter the data required for connection to the database .
the cart@@ on card load .@@ f@@ m draws the support for bur@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; can submit the names of en@@ iel@@ ded mos@@ quit@@ oes to a poll@@ ut@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations concerning the current piece .
&quot; here you enter your username and password for your bur@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you have no profile , you can register one on the load . &quot;
&quot; split pieces send and so the profile update : this setting allows it &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK , to transmit the names of the split pieces to your bur@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . &quot;
&quot; similar interpre@@ ters call : after activation of this setting will be displayed &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK , a list of similar interpre@@ ters to the each other play . note : you may need a fixed .@@ f@@ m profile to use this feature . &quot;
&quot; &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; eg ; Linux ) . further information can be found in the summary of the functions and the gallery with screens . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ AR@@ OK requires only the C@@ deli@@ bs package and otherwise no other KDE packages . you have to install k@@ deli@@ bs ( including the programs contained therein , because &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; requires some of them , such as modules or scripts ) . we have compiled a little guide on how to compile K@@ deli@@ bs . &quot;
&quot; some features such as the O@@ SD will advance the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org does so work , but flu@@ x@@ box will work for example difficulty . we try to support AM@@ AR@@ OK on all platforms , so we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because these represent an excellent development environment . &quot;
probably one of your files will add a bug in the Tag@@ li@@ b library . you can see the file by typ@@ ing in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / AM@@ AR@@ OK / collection _ scan@@ .@@ log . after that you can delete the file and create the collection again .
mostly this is that Tag@@ lib will cr@@ ashes when reading the met@@ a information from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers under bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; if you use MySQL as a database , then try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK , is something mature . &quot;
&quot; make sure all of the libraries have been compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b has been compiled with GCC 3.@@ 3.@@ x , then this leads to the processing of met@@ a @-@ information . &quot;
&quot; if you use KDE with art@@ s@@ d , then de@@ activate automatic . switch off , if in@@ active for ... in the setting of sound system , or do not use at least no value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the che@@ ers by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail will open automatically with a crash ) , and you will send us a good brick , the error will be guaranteed . &quot;
&quot; this is because of that many program data is available as UT@@ F @-@ 8 into the met@@ a @-@ information , but do not write as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot;
# ! / usr / bin / perl included the file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib@@ - &gt; new ( $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ) ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; errors in writing the tags of $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; \ &apos; unless $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag ; ) ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&quot; &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / petition / dynam@@ ical playlist ) can be used in KDE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , you will find the status de@@ activated on grey and semi @-@ transparent . note that in some cases you need to click on a symbol until these setting shows their effect . &quot;
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ its symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ pix@@ map - then check if AM@@ AR@@ OK has the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos;@@ counter amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p Q@@ T .
&quot; to fix this error , you may remove any colon@@ ized Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that AM@@ AR@@ OK will find the correct version first . &quot;
there are some possibilities . most installation problems clarify the easiest through the help of an expert your Uni@@ x@@ - or Linux distribution . you can also use help with other users or with the developers . use the forum and the IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in the channel # AM@@ AR@@ OK .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please enter there only a mistake if you get something at the master@@ ing of a bug in AM@@ AR@@ OK .
after the start of &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; only a blank playlist appears . how do you get there in music ?
this is easy . use the file browser on the left and open the folder you want . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
&quot; to keep the surface intui@@ tively , the start has been converted into the statisti@@ c window . you can find it under extras statistics . &quot;
the meaning of these symbols has changed with AM@@ AR@@ OK 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for evaluation by the user while the points will be automatically calculated .
&quot; to evaluate pieces , have to display pieces in the playlist , click on the list box and select column displays . you can also use the short @-@ installed Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works when AM@@ AR@@ OK in the background . &quot;
select the files you want to remove and then press Ent@@ f on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button to select your selection and then choose the playlist from the menu .
drag a playlist file with the mouse into the playlist and let them drop them exactly how you would make it with other files as well .
&quot; in the toolbar of playlist , right next to the add @-@ button , is the button playlist , just click on it . &quot;
probably missing the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config . install the package x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel and install &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; new . look also for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ alis@@ ations . &quot;
the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . besides you will find it via the menu bar under extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
&quot; no . yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; therefore uses one of the back@@ end independent approach , therefore the real question are Wel@@ che media types supports G@@ stre@@ amer / X@@ ine / Arts / K@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we can even support text and PN@@ G de@@ co@@ res ! &quot;
&quot; it can ! maybe use Fed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which will be supplied in the pres@@ et no MP3 decoder . the solution : old @-@ F2 , GG : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , n@@ c@@ aste &quot;
start the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; plays MP3 &apos;s from : - )
&quot; if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa S@@ ink , the device must use a bl@@ ender . a bl@@ ender allows for multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneous audio mix@@ er ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix -@@ module for al@@ sa ( software mix@@ er ) . &quot;
the output of this command should help you find the problem of problems and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you may need to specify a different set ( e.g. : os@@ s@@ le ) .
&quot; this is doing &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; already do not forget that media first need to be de@@ coded . you can only hear a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ coded them and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ coding the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can be directly related to AL@@ SA just like X@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . activate Sound@@ server with maximum possible priority ( real @-@ time list ) and increase the size of sound Pu@@ ffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ s@@ wr@@ ap@@ per su@@ id is set .
at KDE 3.@@ 2.@@ X there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia @-@ Code@@ cs that can cause any problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia @-@ Code@@ cs . read this error report . the enlarge of the sound controller in your AL@@ SA furniture .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help you .
&quot; either use the Arts driver , but instead of G@@ Stre@@ amer or X@@ ine , or install KDE multimedia complete to get the faster Arts Code ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; probably use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the X@@ ine driver has been strongly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts Pu@@ ffer in the Control Center and Sound &amp; Multimedia , Sound System . the lower the bu@@ ffer , the less results react to visu@@ alis@@ ations . yes , this is a mistake , please help us fix it . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but when I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , cr@@ ashes &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK . why ? &quot;
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer you need to register all components . run G@@ ST regi@@ sters to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that does not help you can also ask at IR@@ C -@@ channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
try to download AM@@ AR@@ OK before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg down , compile and install it . run the module folder with G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ stream @-@ config ) and run G@@ ST register once again . start now &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK . &quot;
please tell them about bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de.@@ org@@ . if you have a whole list of proposals / wishes you send them the best to our mailing list : AM@@ AR@@ OK @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ s@@ ource@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&quot; &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; is an album of the British Mike Old@@ field . I really like it and find that the name sounds good . besides , the name contains the magic K ... : ) &quot;
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P this is already possible . Set in your calendar program an alarm and let you run with the alarm system : d@@ co@@ p AM@@ AR@@ OK player play
&quot; this command lets &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; run the playback . make sure that &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; runs before you go to bed , then you will be stopped by the soft tones of the music that you &apos;re going to bed before going to bed . &quot;
how can you hear the current title in &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; the title can be found on another computer ?
if a functioning SSH environment is available , you can proceed as follows . diesel command gives you interpre@@ ter and title of the current piece of : SSH w ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ user name AM@@ AR@@ OK player now@@ Play@@ ing
replace IP address with your IP and your username . it pres@@ upp@@ oses that your identification is present in the file ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa .
the visu@@ alis@@ ations may be separated from the &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK button . press this on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent , in size changeable window . &quot;
the combination of C@@ trl + right mouse button puts a piece in the cliff order in queue in queue . by pressing the entry button after a search in the playlist , the first search results are played and the search is reset . &quot;
&quot; OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ cky functions , but what about the symbol in the system section of the control bar ? &quot;
click with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; click on the title of a browser . in the context menu you can choose which browser will be displayed .
my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is on a NFS drive . after the start of AM@@ AR@@ OK the collection database cannot be created and the console appear many error messages . what is now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; does not work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / AM@@ AR@@ OK on a local drive or use am@@ aro@@ k@@ s MySQL support .
&quot; insert the CD , then click in the menu on audio CD . it opens a file browser with multiple folders . you can switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them into the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic code you take instead of files from folders mp3 or og@@ g . &quot;
&quot; Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( Q@@ string ( &quot; SELE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , the F@@ ROM statistics &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &apos; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( &apos; e@@ String ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; basically , this does not fit the previous review with a dimin@@ ishing value , based on how often the play was played . the less influence the piece has played every single rating on the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can enter the evaluation for a piece by yourself by clicking with the right mouse button on a Sp@@ al@@ ten@@ ding in the playlist window , namely , select the rating button on the piece and edit : review or edit F2 . you can also edit the evaluation in dialog with the right mouse button . &quot;
the developers do not want to publish it when you are to publish a stable version of AM@@ AR@@ OK . this means that KDE packages have a fixed publishing plan of the AM@@ AR@@ OK schedule that has been put together with the short term plan of AM@@ AR@@ OK .
&quot; this is a new feature in AM@@ AR@@ OK , which some users can also be able to find anno@@ ying . disable the option icon at the playback in the general settings . &quot;
the Analy@@ zer is part of the toolbar . select Settings toolbar ... and take the desired changes .
&quot; download a design , or create your own . install this then under AM@@ AR@@ OK ... Ap@@ pear@@ ance context @-@ browser design , click on new design .... &quot;
&quot; the symbol was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) too similar . to avoid difficulties , it was removed . &quot;
Kon@@ quer@@ or navigation area enables you to browse monitoring and control of &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK . start Kon@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation area . click on the button Settings ( the top ) and then select AM@@ AR@@ OK button on the button .
Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler is a free service to be sent to the information which is played on an independent server . the service is free of charge and you need only a free username and password . Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ;
&quot; if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of cr@@ ashes and therefore a lot of trou@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; pres@@ um@@ ably became &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; compiled before you have X@@ ine or g@@ stre@@ amer . therefore , the / configure routine does not compile this output modules . you have to configure &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; re@@ configure and install . &quot;
&quot; now I have been installed &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; new , but the output modules still appear not yet . and now ? &quot;
&quot; probably use a distribution that installed the development files separately from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer are installed , the same applies to X@@ ine , you need to install X@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that , you need to compile and install X@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that , you need to re @-@ compile and install again . &quot;
I get the mistake G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ Cri@@ tical * * : Factory for &apos; ad@@ der &apos;s no type .. How can I fix it ?
&quot; your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer has been compiled with pre@@ ad@@ ware , that is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without pre@@ linking . a tip from Mer@@ lin @-@ TC : use any L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile AM@@ AR@@ OK . &quot;
I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype au@@ dia / mp@@ 4 although the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad installed .
to play mp@@ 4 or M4@@ A files with G@@ Stre@@ amer must be installed next to g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad also the module g@@ stre@@ amer c@@ quick@@ time .
you will receive the mistake There is no element present to the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
you are playing an MP3 stream but the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then run as a system administration G@@ ST register . then you will start AM@@ AR@@ OK .
I have a second sound@@ card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use AM@@ AR@@ OK to use the second sound@@ card ?
under settings AM@@ AR@@ OK setup ... Audio output give you the device . typical is e.g. H@@ W : 0 for the standard sound card and H@@ W : 1 for the second .
here you can see an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on one machine with a on@@ board AC@@ 97 @-@ Co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
pc@@ m.@@ int@@ el@@ 8x@@ 0 { type plug sl@@ av@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; H@@ W : 0 &quot; } c@@ tl@@ .@@ int@@ el@@ 8x@@ 0 { type H@@ W card 0 } pc@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type plug sl@@ av@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; H@@ W : 1 &quot; } c@@ tl@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type H@@ W card 1 }
&quot; in the dialog by X@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio one , and the output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib take care of the conversion of the sampling rate , channels and so on ) . &quot;
if you want to use a virtual mix device to de@@ activate the tick on sound@@ card supports m@@ map .

&quot; open the CD @-@ Copy dialog . this also allows the copying of a CD to another medium . alternatively , you can also just copy a copy from one CD , which you would then sometimes prefer to burn , if you want to copy CDs with def@@ ective sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; opens the DVD cop@@ ing dialog . this also allows you to create a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also install only an image from one DVD which will then be able to burn a DVD with the help of copying . furthermore , the target medium must not be large enough to accommodate the entire ( video ) data of the source media in the original form . &quot;
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ R@@ W . this allows you to delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ R@@ W .
&quot; open the dialog to the form@@ atting a DVD . with this dialog you can form@@ atting a DVD ± R ( W ) , making the content completely er@@ ased . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; allows you to choose between writing modes and incre@@ mental . &quot;
&quot; the dialog box asks for a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source that can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( N@@ ero * .n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , so you must use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
&quot; burning a previously , DVD @-@ image . the dialog asks for a * .@@ is@@ o file as a data source , which can be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . &quot;
&quot; an earlier DVD @-@ video can be converted . this dialog box usually appears after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used all @-@ standing @-@ standing video , coding settings and even ways to change the size and cutting black edges . &quot;
&quot; displays information about the occa@@ sional medium . this information is represented in the content , and contain properties of the medium , such as size and titles of the CD or DVD . &quot;
shows a list of the toolbar from &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; when an entry is crossed , the toolbar is visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; when this is crossed , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; switched the folder view or from . the folder view contains an overview of your folder and the CD / DVD drives . if the contents is activated , their content is displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions like media info , locking and un@@ locking of the disk or explo@@ iting of the medium . &quot;
&quot; switched on the table view or from . the contents of the contents allows you to select and drag files into the project view . the contents is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs , provided a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; the head @-@ industri@@ alized in the project view is one or out . the copying is a narrower area , which is only visible when the project view does not contain any real function , it looks only hand@@ some and separates the project view clearly from the remaining views . &quot;
&quot; this will open a dialog window for changing the keyboard regulations for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after having selected one of the available commands in the upper part , one can adjust the short@@ cut order for it further . &quot;
&quot; this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; furniture assist@@ ants . this allows the correct authorization for burning CDs and DVDs to be set . for this , system administration rights you need to enter the password for the system administration ( root ) . &quot;
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here you can adjust general terms and conditions . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should be operating on an@@ hi@@ eb . this dialog is intended to person@@ alize and aimed at the tuning of the program .
&quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also , with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface equipped . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled by a shell script . &quot;
&quot; to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions to use , you can either use the command line d@@ co@@ p , or that is somewhat more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the function@@ alities , therefore , is more your taste and the type of your tasks is decisive , which of the accompanying programs you want . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter , we suppose that you use the command line d@@ co@@ p . to make use of the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; you need to make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following at console : &quot;
&quot; in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , all &amp; none ; -@@ program gem@@ a , supported &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts that are described below . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ reading for &amp; k@@ de ; it can be easily read and stored in MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . also other formats are possible , depending on enc@@ oder that is installed on the computer . &quot;
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading from &amp; CD ; -@@ data in WAV files on the hard disk ) and by many co@@ ders ( comp@@ ress ) . currently en@@ ame for MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs and FLA@@ C ( compar@@ ative compression ) will be added starting from Linux distribution ) . additional co@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
&quot; first , the title of the &amp; CD is read and stored in WAV files on the computer ( recorded and comp@@ ressed ) ; and then &quot;
are in a second step of these WAV files ( usually one per title ) comp@@ ressed to the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format or in other formats like the ver@@ lu@@ st@@ free FLA@@ C .
&quot; for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is compiled . almost any distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step must be installed ( for MP3 ) , og@@ ging up to ( for O@@ GG ) or other co@@ di@@ ers installed . all these programs are usually not necessary for any Linux distribu@@ tions already , it is very likely not necessary to compile anything yourself . if for example FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is also not required . &quot;
which Ko@@ di@@ er@@ er- / File Format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction to co @-@ erer , audio quality and compression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , uses &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is not possible to read a copy of audio data from the &amp; CD ; it is not possible to avoid a protected audio CD ; it is not possible to avoid copying audio CD ; simply avoid the mechanisms of cop@@ ulating audio CD ; simply avoid the purchase of Cop@@ ier@@ protected audio CD ; s ! &quot;
&quot; while the set @-@ up has to be done only once ( the furnishings dialog can be called up to a suitable configuration ) , it will be explained the daily handling of reading a &amp; CD ; this leads ( hopefully ) to understanding the sl@@ ender approach of the user interface , about which you can frequently stum@@ ble at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; can convert into many formats depending on which en@@ coding programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; can use &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB from the internet or can work completely without network , whereby all is manually recorded . &quot;
this is just a brief list of the commands of the main window . on the page step by step example there are further information such as this program is used as well as the screenshot with descriptions of the tab@@ s for the configuration of the program .
&quot; start the CD@@ DB request of the CD @-@ data according to the establishment of request in the tab CD@@ DB . ( this can be locally or online , in the latter case , first the connection must be made to the internet . ) &quot;
start reading and - if a enc@@ oder will be configured according to the coding tab - the coding .
&quot; opens a sub@@ menu with a list of available enc@@ oder , so that the selection can be read with another enc@@ oder as the standard can be read , that previously the enc@@ oder can be configured in the dialog settings in the interior dialog . &quot;
opens the file manager so that an already selected file is selected to be selected instead of a full &amp; CD .
opens the furniture dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for programs ( such as read the &amp; CD ; exit ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the main dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different boxes cards ( such as enc@@ oder , to set up the en@@ co@@ ders ) . here , you must go before the program can be successful ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes key quality , co@@ ter and compress@@ or and helps you choose the right co@@ di@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is to be lost , a ver@@ lu@@ st@@ free audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are also others like &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; Mon@@ key &apos; , which may possibly be available for this distribution . the down@@ sides are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can reproduce these files . &quot;
&quot; among the audio formats , the information generated by data comp@@ ressed according to their psycho@@ acoustic model , are MP3 and O@@ GG . O@@ GG may have a slight advantage compared to MP3 in audio quality at lower bit rates ( up to 128 kb@@ ps ) , but above this bit rate the differences are less important , as both Ko@@ di@@ erer will produce very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still supplied with most distribu@@ tions free , but there are open license questions . &quot;
+ High to high quality sound quality ( with high bit@@ rates ) but compared with O@@ GG slightly deeper quality for deeper bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music should be heard from one machine or a computer based music system and / or when one of the few existing O@@ GG tools available .
&quot; MP3 - when music is also available on other devices such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special auto @-@ stereo systems . today - initially , these devices usually support the MP3 format . &quot;
a brief list of parameters for audio quality and the resulting compression for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting is usually offering transparency for most people and most of the Musik@@ pieces acceptable transparency , and has quite high quality . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 kb@@ ps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . need up to 320 kb@@ ps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo and high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 kb@@ ps C@@ BR , compression rate approximately 5.5 . needs always 256 kb@@ ps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older units need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos;@@ = 128 kb@@ ps C@@ BR joint stereo , compression rate approximately 11 128 kb@@ ps for all pieces of a title . good recovery for music of young people , portable equipment and auto@@ oster@@ e@@ o@@ ats . but not good enough for better Hi@@ Fi stereo . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ kb@@ ps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely superior quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; CD ; information that can be retri@@ eved manually or through the program automatically removed from the free@@ DB via the Internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can commit / needed to create the folder and file name as well as the characteristics of the music files . &quot;
&quot; in connection with Ko@@ di@@ er@@ programs , there is often a combination of programs for the co@@ hesive and these parameters here . the manual or help to the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers declare the switch for these programs . &quot;
&quot; e.g. to add the &amp; CD ; title to the key@@ word ( English : day ) , if MP@@ 3@@ s are coded with l@@ ame , the switch must be added by l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; the result looks like : &apos; -@@ tt { Tit@@ le } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be needed ( = Kn@@ op@@ f@@ be@@ zel in assist@@ ants ) :
&quot; this is what the free@@ DB is : a free database , in which persons can read / enter , so that all the other information can be downloaded instead of yourself in the computer . it is to be noted that here only by text is spoken : &amp; CD ; title , artist , names of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not by the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal but I ( An@@ no@@ m of the shores ) : so the author is not attorney . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; more or less valuable , so cannot be added any of the artist nor the music enterprise . all information can be obtained on a b@@ um@@ mel through a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; it is actively engaged to select a cross @-@ field . for use of free@@ DB can be used as the used in the system . in this type of configuration , it appears , the e @-@ mail address will not be used by the server ( this can only be the programmer who reviewed the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are in many countries copies of the main database . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; to use free@@ DB is set to use the geographic server , the geographic server is needed in the network and resem@@ bles the load between the computers . &quot;
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of Mir@@ ror servers for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information while reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually published monthly ) just the updates of the database .
which utility program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
&quot; there are sc@@ ams that this c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; whoever wants to know more accurately , search in the source code ... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; see that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed first if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; to save the WAV files can be chosen the codi@@ le and thus the desired file format . at the first opening there are pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a compar@@ ative compression for audio data ) on the tab . other co@@ er@@ ers can be added on this tab . &quot;
the Ko@@ di@@ erer package must be installed by the relevant Linux distribution before the codi@@ le can be used . this is also required for the pre@@ defined co@@ er@@ ers . further information on Ko@@ di@@ erer can be found in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a co @-@ code you can get more information about his switch by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a con@@ soles ( eg ; con@@ sole ) . it must be replaced by the name of the installed Ko@@ di@@ ver .
&quot; this may have many causes . check the setting up the device designation of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drives , the write - and readers are installed and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio en@@ coding of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) are installed . try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal . this could give an indication of what is wrong . &quot;
check whether you do not want a copy audio CD ; you want to read the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is one chapter with one step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; read the complete manual , everything understood but somehow still is un@@ certain what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to make those areas exactly what you want . &quot;
in this example we will start the program for the first time everything setup and our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to create MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 kb@@ ps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 key@@ word ( tags ) .
&quot; it must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . an appropriate package for l@@ ame can be found for example with a search engine , as it is not necessary to compile the source files as you can of course always do . &quot;
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you own writer ( eg ; by trying to copy with the con@@ quer@@ or something ) .
the first section deals the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; something that is probably only done once and
the second section describes how to read the action on a &amp; CD ; what has to be repeated for every purpose .
&quot; here we determine the selected co@@ er@@ ers to compression the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 kb@@ ps ) . since we are la@@ zy , we share the program with the free@@ DB to download the &amp; CD ; data from the Internet . &quot;
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will likely not be able to read at every output of a &amp; CD , once the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the device drawing is transferred to the reader programme to read it the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces can be read .
&quot; frequently , / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device designation of your drive . if this is not working or if more than a &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , so a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the entries of the device labels for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
the card @-@ card general settings . here you don &apos;t have much to do . here an additional conversion will be defined . in our example everything will be shown as shown in the screenshot is shown .
&quot; only in case of un@@ complete information , you will be informed if statements are ab@@ sent to the witness of keywords ( tags ) . &quot;
the card @-@ card CD ; -@@ settings . simply both entries selected . we are convenient and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically via the Internet from a free@@ DB computer .
note : the machine must be connected during the read of the &amp; CD ; using the Internet to access the free@@ DB server .
&quot; the second listing is easier , is a &amp; CD ; entry containing immediately the read @-@ read / fil@@ en@@ ame or tag entries , they can be easily changed using con@@ quer@@ or file name , and the ID@@ 3 @-@ tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example , to note : if you want to manually enter everything manually , you can use the selection fields and free@@ DB is not used . however , you can use the database previously . however , the two selection fields must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set on the following box card . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is for us free@@ DB . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ ev@@ ing the &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB server on the internet . how do the system you get to get the CD ? read the section about free@@ DB . put everything in the screenshot is shown in the screenshot . &quot;
mode : we have not downloaded the database with remote database on the Internet server .
&quot; CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server in your area . on this path , the load is distributed among the machines . this setting will work as a first attempt . &quot;
&quot; both work equally well as the server concerns , since many fire@@ walls protocol the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there is perhaps more luck with the 80 , as the &amp; HTTP ; protocol is usually open to surf the Internet . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we do not want to transfer any &amp; CD ; data to the free@@ DB server . the first impulse @-@ box should dis@@ abling . &quot;
simply take the settings from the screenshot . ( make sure that the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
&quot; number of play@@ able pieces : exc@@ use , there is a reason why more than one at the same time when using existing drive ? parall@@ el@@ es Read and coding ? the author does not know , therefore simply try . &quot;
CD ; after reading the last piece : select this to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the trial .
&quot; custom folder for temporary files : if you are specified it , then / must be specified the path / folder in which the WAV files are placed . if the box does not specify , the files in a private folder will not be copied , if you want to do something with the WAV files . &quot;
&quot; everything just enter as it is on the screenshot is . the command is a bit long , under circumstances a bit has to be left to the right to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good Hi@@ Fi stereo . the compression factor is about 224 to 256 cp@@ bs . the reached compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory . &quot;
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the restriction of the production of tags on version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1.@@ ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; Tags can also be deleted if required . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; ID@@ 3 &apos; Tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change in the tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
Set the rest like shown in the screenshot . some comments for future use outside this sample :
&quot; number of simultaneous WAV files : with a dual core or quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried to en@@ coding more than one WAV file at the same time . &quot;
&quot; this is it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; this configuration is used as standard for each reading of an &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music , you will never need it again . &quot;
&quot; in this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; the folder structure is organized and furnished . first , a connection to the Internet is structured , as we are convenient and the &amp; CD ; data is described in this section , must be repeated for any in@@ adequ@@ ately &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; since we use a &amp; CD , the screenshot is not yet contained in free@@ DB , the screenshot is a little different from the same for a &amp; CD ; therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually , instead of collecting them from the internet . comments are to be noted on the differences . &quot;
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is to find . it is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this hand@@ book .
&quot; if this is not yet done , now the &amp; CD must be defined in the drive that was defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment , the pieces and length should be listed in the window , just like the screenshot now . this only when the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD : be identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; if this does not happen , then look in the section questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section on the basic settings . &quot;
&quot; note : if the &amp; CD has been picked up successfully by the free@@ DB , all the titles of the pieces are already filled out , and the name of the artist and the album are shown . &quot;
&quot; in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; -@@ key to your &amp; CD ; there will be a window appears , and you can choose the database entry in your opinion best to your &amp; CD ; &quot;
&quot; if you do not select the cross @-@ section for the automatic query of free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in dialogue for settings ) , you can also manually trigger you to your database when selecting the first button in the toolbar . if you do not collect local database , you need the connection to the Internet . &quot;
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - write the CD @-@ Data and the Tit@@ els of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screenshot one . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; updates &apos; the rest of the data in the input field &apos; album &apos; .
the artist must not be given more in the input field &apos; actu@@ ator title &apos; unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
the lower comment field can be used for single comments ini@@ di@@ ap@@ ell per piece , the comment field of the album will be used for comments that are common to all the pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of data from the free@@ DB is not empty , but it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editors ( e.g. if all words begin with great letters letters or not ... ) but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limited the length of the fields on 30 characters for the artist , album and titles of a piece , and only 28 characters for the comment . if you are ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags ; this option will be set up on the tab code settings ; take a look at the section &quot; basic settings &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; you can change the day information of the generated files later at any time with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags . &quot;
tags will not be supported by all Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ern or file formats . see the help to the Ko@@ di@@ erer to get more information .
simply select an entry containing the style of the in@@ adequ@@ acy CD . this example is not important as we address the &amp; CD ; -@@ Data is not forward . for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or rap for example are to be found under Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; come back to the main window . click on the line with the second piece .
&quot; the window of the CD editor will be released again and you will see that the fields for the album is already filled with the entered data , which we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . just enter the title of the piece on any case and other information you wish . &quot;
click on the next line in the main window and proceed to the same way up to you all the title data of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the free@@ DB . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the toolbar . note that the artist and the album are shown above the item list .
&quot; note that there is a check @-@ character prior to each line of a piece . only the titles are chosen in front of each line of a piece . just make sure that all the pieces are selected , or add the button all the pieces at the bottom of the screen to choose all the pieces . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the button selection out of reading the reading process , this window will appear for confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what abl@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; click on the tab for switching on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is read straight to the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the lower part of the window in the status line . &quot;
&quot; this error message can be seen if you are trying to work with a co@@ ter , which you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully coded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list . &quot;
&quot; by the way , the folder for the tmp file and the target folder are not what we have entered here in example . have you checked whether you write writing access to the folder for the temporary files and target folders ? ; - ) &quot;
&quot; now it is clear , why the error occurred directly after the end of the reading of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new record : contract 4 is the coding of pieces 1 into the format MP3 . this makes it possible to read and en@@ coding in parallel . note the status details in the bottom of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
&quot; the author of the program has found no configuration settings to read this behavior . the only thing is configur@@ able , the result of con@@ current processes is un@@ clear . the machine used with a AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem during simultaneous output and en@@ coding ( of however two different pieces ) . &quot;
&quot; now the final title is read , while another piece is coded and a third job turns into the queue of the body . after the last piece is coded , a small window with a message for a short time in the upper left side of the window appears . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x. or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create comp@@ ressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the codi@@ le of your choice . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; today , within the &amp; k@@ de ; CV@@ S is already familiar with CV@@ S , you can download an anonymous copy here . most distribu@@ tions already included . most distribu@@ tions already included . most distribu@@ tions already included in your distribution . if you &apos;re reading this , you probably have already done ... &quot;
&quot; this section is directed to persons , compiled by source files , and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are searching for help how the program can be adapted to your needs , if it is running time , then the following is true for you : &quot;
&quot; a program that calls many different programs , has many variants of settings . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it displays the screenshot of the various boxes of settings and also includes comments for options that may not be used in the example . &quot;
&quot; hello , still on read ? even if only the help menu is cli@@ cked after the first time of the program , without any cl@@ ue as it was supposed to go out from this somehow empty screen ( especially when at the time of the program starts no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu from ? &quot;
&quot; what is it about ? who reads this , probably has already started the program . it should look like this : &quot;
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately , no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual on &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; it is thought always something to add or change it . at least just after cont@@ acting the author . and if you read this , he did this section and therefore agree with this proposal . &quot;
&quot; strange when it succeeded in getting the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N to pick up , then you do not need this information , but ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kara@@ ok@@ esp@@ er of &amp; k@@ de ; beside others he has no real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ a@@ oke @-@ real @-@ time consolidation of texts also some features , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI @-@ Player . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; k@@ mid ; also supports the &amp; Linux ; ultr@@ as@@ o@@ und @-@ project driver , which is required for CIS cards . AL@@ SA is supported once it supports a sequence . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it is easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by pressing a pressing key on the ( virtual ) keyboard .

supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( lyrics or textiles ) .
seat support . if you finish &amp; k@@ de ; during the playback of a song finish the mid will start again with the same song again .
&quot; supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , A@@ we , FM and CIS cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P -@@ driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can choose opening ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog with which you can choose the desired song . &quot;
you can also drop a file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; Windows to drop in the &amp; mid @-@ mid @-@ window . this also works with multiple songs simultaneously .
&quot; to play a piece of music , you open it and add the button to play in the toolbar , select the entry ticket from the menu piece or add the id@@ ols . &quot;
&quot; please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece automatically starts , once you move it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window will be added to a collection and then played up each other . ) &quot;
&quot; once &amp; mid @-@ mid ; one piece goes , you can jump to any point by using the middle mouse button and drive with the rain . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is too fast or slow down , you can click on the left and right of the Tem@@ po@@ on and thus change the play@@ speed . to return the original speed , double click the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the id@@ key has two tasks : if a piece is played , a pressure on the button break or off the menu entry into the menu piece , thus breaks off the playback . add the id@@ ols while no piece is played , starts &amp; mid @-@ mid ; the playback . &quot;
&quot; lyrics can be stored on two species in a piece of music . some pieces use tex@@ tual event , others use lyrics and another both . some pieces have no text : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; mid ; you can set up which events are to be displayed and even better : the event ni@@ sty@@ p will automatically determine which a song will be used , so that you have nothing manually , so that you want nothing to manually , if you want to change the new kar@@ a@@ oke text . however , you still have the opportunity to change this when you want to see the other way . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set an event type , select from the menu settings the entries text and lyrics . the same function also have the buttons 1 and 2 . &quot;
a collection is a list of MIDI files which you summar@@ ise . these are set up in line . this section is how you can use Coll@@ ections efficiently .
&quot; to create a collection , you first open the collection ager . this can be found in the menu collection under the point .... Click there to New and enter the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy a existing collection by clicking Copy and then select the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs like the original .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can set the winn@@ ings in the collection ager . &quot;
in the temporary collection you will reach all the songs that you want to add to any other collection .
&quot; when leaving the application this collection is not saved . concerns the , if you add many pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection ager . there you can add a song using the button Add a song . it appears in turn the file dialog , using its help you can choose the desired song . &quot;
&quot; a second method to add a song depends on the adjustment of automatic adding to the collection . &quot;
&quot; when automatic adding is activated , a piece when opening ( using File Open or Drag &amp; Drop ) automatically added to the active collection . &quot;
&quot; when automatic add to the collection is not activated , when opening a piece the temporary collection is activated and yellow . this collection will then be added to the newly opened pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you have to open the collection ager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove . &quot;
&quot; you can choose the order that are played in which the songs are played . if you choose the sequence , the songs are played in order , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; if you add songs or add or remove or random order in the menu , the order will be re @-@ defined . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collection ager or use the selection list above the kar@@ a@@ oke text . &quot;
&quot; to jump to a song , select the button of the song , the entry next song from the menu piece or press the arrow to the right . &quot;
&quot; to reverse a song back , select the button pre@@ previous piece , the entry previous piece of the menu piece or press the arrow to the left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection ager , select the delet@@ ing collection and click the button Delete . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection can not be deleted . however , this doesn &apos;t matter as they are stored by &amp; mid ; not saved . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thesizer , which are not general MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ map General @-@ MIDI events are translated into events that syn@@ thesizer the syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map showing all events of the type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the type Change patch to Tru@@ mp@@ et and therefore always sound a trumpet when originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you have only one sound@@ card , you don &apos;t need any MIDI @-@ map , because all sound cards GM are compatible ( including A@@ we - and CIS cards , FM -@@ devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; there are no programs to create MIDI maps , so you must edit the appropriate file from hand ( with your favorite editor ) . &quot;
a MIDI @-@ map is a text file that stores all necessary conver@@ sions to play a piece .
&quot; each section may only appear once , except KE@@ Y@@ MAP section that may appear so often as desired . prerequisite for this is , however , that any appearance has a different text ID ( see below ) . &quot;
De@@ fine PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MAP &quot; Name of the Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MAP &quot; A further Key@@ map ... EN@@ D De@@ fine CH@@ ANN@@ EL@@ D ... EN@@ D Options ... EN@@ D
&quot; they see that De@@ fine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for Options ) and EN@@ D , that the end of a section is achieved . &quot;
please send me your map file as e @-@ mail so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can be compatible with devices that are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible devices .
in this section the patches of General MIDI on your specific keyboard will be illustrated . the general usage looks as follows :
&quot; please note that the left side of the equation sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM -@@ patches are in the right sequence ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and do not leave any line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; optional all key@@ s@@ To M is needed to put all notes that need this instrument on the tone with the number M . if your keyboard supports an example ( GM @-@ patch 127 ) , you can use a drum ( e.g. with clay 60 ) , that is similar to the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section . &quot;
&quot; so if a MIDI file should play a note with patch 127 ( screw @-@ shot ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of what sound is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that the patch is targeted here with the term drum patch ( drum , bas@@ ins , Marac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one who means the tone the tone of the always same drum ( like him some key@@ boards ) . &quot;
the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section will be needed to specify how to be illustrated on a specific channel or instrument .
&quot; as in the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section the order of lines is very important , as well as their presence . you must therefore have 128 entries . &quot;
you can define multiple Key@@ boards for each channel and every instrument . you only have to use different names in the first row .
key@@ maps are used mainly to make tones on the per@@ k@@ le channel . watch out as an example the provided Key@@ boards .
&quot; this section can be used to form some channels to others . if you want to exchange for example the first and second channel , you simply make it in CH@@ ANN@@ EL@@ MAP section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for Key@@ boards , which have the per@@ plex@@ es on a specific channel ( General MIDI to channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; Midi @-@ Devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ ANN@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , according to the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; N is the channel , which is listed on the Channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the key@@ map needs to be defined in the file name , all events will be ignored that will try the patch on this channel . in this case it will always be Patch x uses . &quot;
the For@@ ce@@ patch option can be useful for example to always use the per@@ k@@ le patch on the Persian canal .
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ Ratio gives the value of Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der @-@ events . if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der @-@ Event with the value n , this with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) is calculated and then only passed on . the value 40@@ 96 is used , so that in the map file is not a dec@@ imal number ) . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed because GM means that a keyboard , which should play a pitch , which should play a sound higher with the value 40@@ 96 , but try to play some key@@ boards up to an oc@@ tave above . to try to try the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; mid ; &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI @-@ map , just open the dialog MIDI settings . this can be found in the menu under settings , point MIDI settings &quot;
the channel view is a window with a whole range of piano signat@@ ures ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these pianos you can see which sounds are straight .
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel . for each channel , there is a selection listing , where you can choose an instrument , the button is no more green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
the channel view has ( until now ) two different views to view the split @-@ tones . view in the menu settings under the point channel view : settings
&quot; the pace @-@ LCD indicates the speed , which is played with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the pace of a song . if you find e.g. one song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow@@ down it down . to change the pace , use the arrows left and right of the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file that includes information about how a music piece has to be played . it contains the notes , the rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; so that the same MIDI file may result in two different devices to very different results , just as two different musicians play the same notes in a very different way . &quot;
&quot; well , I cannot force anyone , &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file has a similar sound quality . with a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc . you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) from &amp; mid ; have done . that has happened because &amp; k@@ mid ; without A@@ we support you need to download a source distribution and install ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s home page ) &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I do not want to add all files individually . &quot;
&quot; agreed to support &amp; k@@ mid ; Drag &amp; Drop . simply open the folder that you want to add to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files , and drag them onto the &amp; mid @-@ mid @-@ window . &quot;
once you need to enable automatic adding to the collection . otherwise the files are added to a temporary collection .
you can click the arrow key to the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD bet@@ s to slow@@ down the playback . to restore the standard temp@@ o you can double on the LCD double .
I &apos;ve been on a &amp; k@@ de ; desktop space a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I want to play a MIDI file ) or I want to play a file just in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; move the window and drag the file into the window from &amp; k@@ mid ;
&quot; if you want to listen to a file quickly , without adding it to a collection , switch the setting automatic adding to the collection , and the new ; file is added to a temporary collection . opening files &quot;
&quot; if we take you , you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ . do not just want to play the first file . so set the setting automatic adding to the collection and then open up your temporary collection then contains exactly these a MIDI file . &quot;
then sign up even B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid ab@@ ell p@@ iel@@ s and a collection with all three files to create . how do you do that ?
these people sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards sent . all sincere thanks ! if I see these songs or see the postcard , anim@@ ates me to program on &amp; k@@ mid ; to program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; and I am in the third year , so I &apos;m trying to take much free time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take a little time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to get a bit of time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to collect MIDI files , making music and prove sent@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where they can download MIDI / Kara@@ oke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es &quot;

&quot; a sound@@ card . I recommend you a good sound@@ card or an external syn@@ thesizer , as the sound quality depends fundamentally on your sound card . it &apos;s not the same whether you use a FM radio device or an A@@ we card . &quot;
&quot; if you have no sound card , you need to compile &amp; mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL compile it as if you would have a sound@@ card , except that you can of course not listen to music . &quot;

&quot; &amp; km@@ player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , ph@@ ono and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is needed to play video files from M@@ Player or PH@@ ON@@ ON supported formats , as well as to play DVD &apos;s , V@@ CD or TV and camera . &quot;

&quot; the use window is made of so called and@@ ock@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is the window with the playlist . and finally , there is a information window that will only be displayed when information can be recovered . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to add the preferred connections under the menu book@@ marks , but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played by each other , so you should use the category permanent playlist . &quot;
&quot; naturally , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy . if you select an entry , its group and all its sub@@ categories to the current category is copied and the playback begins with the attached entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; updated pieces &apos; , television and permanent playlist can also be modified by direc@@ ting the XML configuration files . of course , the various files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / km@@ player / , can be viewed by an editor , but also by applying the mode mode . by the cli@@ pping of a sub @-@ group , only the XML content of this part is displayed . &quot;
&quot; after Chang@@ ing XML files , the menu must be selected and chosen from the menu and either chosen mode , or another category is selected . &quot;
all changes are lost when the machining mode leave or a different group is selected without the playlist .
&quot; as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; km@@ player , some functions can only be switched by changing the XML configuration files .. &quot;
&quot; the animation during the start@@ up and end may be disabled by the edi@@ tions of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c and modify &#91; general Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be easily inserted . &quot;
it is also possible to enable another animation . &amp; km@@ player ; the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / km@@ player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / km@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation during the start@@ up does not need to be short , it is automatically termin@@ ated by opening a different source . this would not disturbing the user through the end @-@ Animation , the user can therefore end the application a second time . &quot;
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the ads of a favorite image : &amp; lt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; IMG _ home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ ted ; in the source package of &amp; km@@ player ; are supported in the directory tests / some examples of S@@ MI@@ L that are supported by &amp; km@@ player ;
there is a rider for configuration of M@@ Player in the configuration dialog by &amp; km@@ player ; here the path from the M@@ Player and the clip@@ board size of the data stream from the network and other things can be adjusted .
another tool for de@@ bug@@ ging is the button &apos; console &apos; in the toolbar of km@@ player . here is the output of M@@ Player .
there is no rider for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog by &amp; km@@ player ; everything must be configured by manually updating the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa is played :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; km@@ player ; it can even be inserted the special field Em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
&quot; so that the &amp; km@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages can be re@@ fine , the &amp; km@@ player template must be specified as a service provider for the M@@ IME type / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the dialog boxes of KDE labels . &quot;
&quot; the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; km@@ player ; is used in a con@@ soles application and search error messages regarding the loading of the browser module library . the tri@@ cky process will occur , the back@@ end output is displayed within &amp; km@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore always a given back@@ end for a particular M@@ IME type is taken ( of course only if this has also been determined ) , this must be done by manual Change of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example PH@@ ON@@ ON can restore all og@@ g files : &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ player ; can be installed from TV cards , either via M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . this can be configured to use @-@ to @-@ use device and TV channels . this can be configured to manually edit the scanner from the configuration dialog box or the configuration file can be edited manually . &quot;
&quot; to configure the V@@ DR ( video data Rek@@ order ) settings in the km@@ player , the dialog is detected in the Settings below - &gt; S@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there you should be selected ( e.g. , it is PAL for west Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DV@@ B in it . &quot;
&quot; since the V@@ DR can use of km@@ player just X@@ Video , it should also function X@@ Video ( probably this type of playback of video devices under Linux the only one works ) . this is also necessary to use the vide@@ o@@ for@@ l@@ inux extension to the X server ( / etc / X11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) . &quot;

are there hints like I can make my CD@@ ROM drive lower when I play from him ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is as user root after installing the device . it is absolutely sure that / dev / c@@ drom with the CD@@ ROM drive shows .
X@@ ine will only start slowly but every time my CPU has to be tested on their performance ?

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed for comp@@ iling from &amp; k@@ ile ;
lat@@ ex ; : a professional folding application . under Unix @-@ like systems is likely to be returned to the package &amp; tex@@ tures ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be used in the used &amp; Linux ; -@@ distribution . for installation should be the documentation of the distribution or installation disc ; / DVD .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; the project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for various distribu@@ tions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the k@@ ile ; website .
&quot; this hand@@ book is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; &quot;
&quot; advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all proposals for documentation should be taken into account . is the support for this project or the documentation desired , the contact over the k@@ ile should be made . &quot;
if you have questions or when comp@@ iling from &amp; k@@ ile ; or extensions desired , this should be addressed to the mailing list k@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ s@@ ource@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ surroundings for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; installation space . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers the possibility for the use of all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ programs in a graphical interface and within these a simple , immediate and tailored access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; programs . finally , the easy to use wiz@@ ard , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference and the powerful project management . &quot;
to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and its possibilities should be read the manual to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can be started directly by reading the chapters working with the editor of &amp; Kate ;
for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the correct expression : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . is the right expression : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . can use a La@@ ie ( English . lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ mac@@ ros is that it originates from the surname of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
&quot; here only a good orientation to &amp; lat@@ ex ; given it is not the ultimate book to be able to place &amp; lat@@ ex ; a guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : Document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced User , 3rd Edition , 1999 &quot;
&quot; just as other output languages includes &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction , with which the all@@ eged properties like paper format , page numbered und texture , which starts with the command \ \ BE@@ G@@ IN { document } , and must be closed with the command \ \ end { document } . &quot;
the quick @-@ ascent assistant of &amp; k@@ ile ; is a native function for the fast creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; the selection of assist@@ ants ( menu ) provides some possibilities for creating the document .
&quot; docum@@ entations : this is hereby the way of the document list : article &#91; book &#93; , report &#91; review &#93; , report &#91; review &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ art@@ cl &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ aper &#93; , proj@@ ector &#91; Beam@@ forming &#93; , slides &#91; Prosp@@ er &#93; or Custom . &quot;
en@@ coding : hereby the character en@@ coding is set . modern systems are used to use the UT@@ F @-@ 8 -@@ coding as standard . best , UT@@ F @-@ 8x should be under@@ estimated ( to correct processing of the &amp; lat@@ ex ; documents ) . &quot;
this list is mostly used for additional packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for incorpor@@ ating them only in the cross field .
&quot; article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , Report ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Com@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German requirements ) . you should always find use in the creation of German texts . &quot;
new users are not worried either . it is merely a brief description of the functions and further information in this section .
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; offers - just as other source code editors - the accuracy of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . by &amp; k@@ ile ; it &apos;s a simple problem looking for some mathematical environment . however , it is due to that any mathematical environment is not closed . however , it will save you through the hum@@ ble time and shift . &quot;
&quot; with the automatic adjustment of the environments , it is created by entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ BE@@ G@@ IN { Command } ) by &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically create a whit@@ line ( for input of text ) and the per@@ im@@ print line ( e.g. \ \ end { Command } ) . this function can be disabled in the menu settings , setup ... La@@ TeX commands will be disabled . &quot;
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; erm@@ ined the sub@@ division of the document into the following items ( part is the most important and sub@@ merged the sub@@ merged element ) :
&quot; in view of the document in the structure , the single elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click on the respective changes . &quot;
when creating the own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful in creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ files can be very helpful . once a DVI ; -@@ file was created &amp; k@@ ile ; by a click with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ viewer to the corresponding line in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source text .
a DVI ; -@@ file revealed a description of the form@@ atted document and also other information such as the font and is adjacent to PDF the exact output type of &amp; Tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; there are many tools to view conversion and print of DVI ; files for various systems and straight@@ ens .
&quot; when using the wheel search , the elements of the DVI ; -@@ File has been cli@@ cked with the Editor and once upon an element in the DVI ; -@@ HTML text was cli@@ cked , becomes the exact opposite of it . once on a section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; the source text was cli@@ cked , becomes the appropriate place in the DVI ; -@@ viewers . &quot;
Master @-@ document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a Master document the work with other integrated .@@ tex files will be simplified . when using a project a project project can be adjusted for project settings .
quick @-@ construction : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ HTML text is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if no errors in the source text are ) .
file Sharing : in this mode the DVI ; -@@ file is based on - and it is not a call of &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the quick @-@ building .
&quot; in view of the Edit toolbar , the three co@@ es of the selection criteria should be developed into the document . the first selection process is designed for the fast structure of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... The Constitu@@ tional &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands for the sub@@ division are : &quot;
&quot; the Edit panel further is for one of articles such as tags , fu@@ Ã ic notes or references . the disc@@ ol@@ abilities are : &quot;
&quot; name : with this command a name for a section , an image or other element is created . &quot;
cover : is used for reference to a fixed term ( selection above ) .
&quot; using quotation , a selection list with liter@@ ary entries is displayed . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; it only works when the file is necessary to a project . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are also available in &amp; k@@ ile ; by hand . &quot;
&quot; the last drop @-@ box with the name of Gre@@ Ã ¶ le is used for defining the font . it is possible to set the font , the fu@@ Ã ic notes , etc . , there are the following fonts : &quot;
&quot; when calling &amp; k@@ ile , there are two choices for creating a new document by selecting the document type and restric@@ ting the settings . 2 . the document can be written on hand with the hand . &quot;
&quot; the brack@@ ets after the command \ \ docum@@ ent@@ ment contain the settings for the command . the font is fixed . the font is not at the beginning , this can also be done in the text . &quot;
once the above source text has been entered the &amp; lat@@ ex ; the source text has to be compiled . the easiest way to this is the use of the menu labels or but@@ ton@@ ing fast .
the source text must be saved in front of the comp@@ iling . &amp; k@@ ile ; for saving the storage automatically .
&quot; the comp@@ iling of the document fails , should be sear@@ ched in the log for errors . when using quick construction , it should be started . if this is not the case , also the logging should be noticed . &quot;
&quot; an environment ( engl@@ er environment ) is a text that is treated differently than the remaining document . for example , a report with the font and \ \ end { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } . &quot;
there are only possible within the area ( of \ \ BE@@ G@@ IN { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no circum@@ stance ( number ) for the treatment within an environment .
&quot; there are many possibilities to enhance the legi@@ bility and usability of the document . you can also use certain fonts , fat , cur@@ si@@ veness , sub@@ missions , etc. added to the command \ \ end or automatic at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ BE@@ G@@ IN { emp@@ h } : this command is for the short pressure and is as long as it is closed until he is closed with an \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in one sentence can be displayed with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ BE@@ G@@ IN { quote } and ends with \ \ end { quote } .
&quot; after the background was presented to writing the source text with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ mark @-@ address , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; &quot;
&quot; once in the assist@@ ants a bit text was entered , a few adjustments should be accomplished for the better re@@ adability of the document . this should be mind@@ set , a few positions in the fat and cur@@ si@@ v@@ print and a poem to apply to see the differences of these commands . &quot;
&quot; once the document was viewed , the editor @-@ view or Str@@ g E may return to the editor again ( in the internal viewer ) . with an external viewer , the window must be closed . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI ; -@@ file has been created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file can be converted . simply try and rin@@ se . &quot;
DVI ; is a rounded file format . these files are created by &amp; Tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the re@@ adability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi @-@ issue such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF -@@ transform@@ ers or computer screen monitors . &quot;
for the print of a &amp; DVI ; file are the same steps as for the creation of the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - can then be printed out the document ( if the printer is correct ) .
&quot; the toolbar , the conversion of the DVI , file into other formats . once the DVI ; -@@ file created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; the source text has been created , the conversion can start into the toolbar . &quot;
the pre @-@ looking search for direct jump from the editor for the per@@ missible position within the DVI ; -@@ file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Bin@@ Ã ¤ r@@ files . this needs only Modern under settings K@@ ile setup ... tools are selected .
&quot; to choose the pre @-@ looking search , the mouse pointer must be positioned in a line of the source code and as@@ leep for viewing on precau@@ tions . the jump to the appropriate place in the DVI ; -@@ viewer is then so@@ unded . &quot;
with this function in &amp; Oc@@ ular ; a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; comp@@ elling and to the corresponding line . there must be &amp; k@@ ile ; in &amp; Oc@@ ular ; as text editor will set ( settings Ok@@ ular ... Editor )
&quot; should when using a quick @-@ speed of the &amp; DVI ; -@@ viewer not , a bug may appear . should be a mistake , this will be displayed in the log file or in the message window . &quot;
the logging file is always used in the source text . in the editor you can then use the button of La@@ TeX errors and N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ ster La@@ TeX @-@ errors and N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ ster La@@ TeX @-@ errors and incl@@ ined faul@@ ty must be cli@@ cked on the errors in the log file and &amp; k@@ ile ; jump to faul@@ ty line .
&quot; once you click on the corresponding button in the toolbar , a window will appear to select the template to be selected for the document . &quot;
&quot; in selecting of empty document , a document can be written either from scratch or the wiz@@ ard to quickly create a new document . further information can be found in the section . &quot;
&quot; value users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates , can be stored and loaded into &amp; k@@ ile ; allows and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
to create a new template needs to be created either an existing &amp; Tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; a new template can be created . &amp; k@@ ile ; can create a new template using an existing document and select a file template .
when creating a new document from a template using a file New characters will be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character en@@ coding ) . these variables can be set in settings K@@ ile ... settings in general .
&quot; when creating your own template , it is necessary to know which string chains of which variables are to be replaced : &quot;
&quot; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ LA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ : this string is replaced by input in documentation class . typically , they will be used : \ \ Docum@@ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ LA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { article } . &quot;
the easiest way to create a template is the use of assist@@ ants and associated with the commands of the commands in the editor . once the document was created in this way the following steps were accomplished :
&quot; when creating a new document , it can then be filled with its own template instead of default . &quot;
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; a simple way to create a template should be looked after one on the internet and follow the steps described below .
&amp; k@@ ile ; uses &amp; Kate ; as internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for reading and herr@@ ing of many different types of text files ( including also &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for you &amp; Kate ; can be done directly from &amp; k@@ ile ;
to know more about &amp; Kate ; and its features should be read the manual to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can be used there directly by reading the chapters working with the editor of &amp; Kate ;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ instruction reference , which can be inv@@ oked on the menu of La@@ TeX reference . you can find an expres@@ sive description of nearly all commands , that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use as well as their syntax . &quot;
a double @-@ click with penet@@ rated Str@@ g button to select the &amp; Tex ; -@@ word to choose \ \ par of \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p just \ \ par .
&quot; in the drag of the text , the left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied into the clip@@ board . &quot;
&quot; when using the arrow buttons , you can taste some parts of the source text in the Edit@@ ing window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; has the possibilities to browse the most varied kinds of source texts , and acc@@ entu@@ ate them . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands from the normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ulas are highlighted by another color . &quot;
&quot; many assist@@ ants are also possible to have a own type of book@@ marks within the text . this is also highlighted the jump to n@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ th or last spr@@ ing@@ es , so that it is automatically highlighted in the first input of a character . &quot;
&quot; the machining is probably one of the main aspects in using a program like &amp; k@@ ile . although &amp; Kate ; important features were added in &amp; k@@ ile ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; special commands for their selection . under Edit exclusion , the following commands are included in the text code : &quot;
&quot; under@@ mines a complete paragraph ( group of lines referred to on both sides a blank line ) . this extended meaning do not include a text by means of tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands and all other lines of source code . the only be@@ u@@ clari@@ fied thing in &amp; k@@ ile ; it is the only way separated by two blank lines . &quot;
&quot; the word under the current cursor position . this selection also has an advanced meaning , since this command also has &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end . &quot;
&quot; to the reading of a part of the document , the ke@@ eper of this document can be removed ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers with own command for a faster manifestation . under Edit Rem@@ ove are included in the following commands : &quot;
remove a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; k@@ ile ; is included in the description of machining volumes .
it was already glori@@ fied that environments a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore it offers &amp; k@@ ile ; for additional commands under the Edit environment for an extremely simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ;
this command will be j@@ ump@@ ed with this command to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to enlarge the environment .
with this command the current setting is inj@@ ected at the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to the pier of the surrounding area .
if the cursor is located or inside the command \ \ BE@@ G@@ IN { Sur@@ round@@ ings } is an end to the surrounding area ( or vice versa ) .
&quot; in the input of many fu@@ tile environmental commands can quickly get lost off . this command as@@ hi@@ sto@@ cked the most recently opened environment , so that the wast@@ ed ambient structure is not scattered . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ groups , which are determined by brack@@ ets { ... } . under Edit TeX Group are a few important commands to those from the Edit environment . &quot;
this command becomes the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the cl@@ amp cl@@ amp cl@@ amp .
with this command the end of the current group calls ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the wel@@ ded cl@@ asp .
&quot; if the cursor is before or behind the soft cl@@ amp of a &amp; Tex ; a group # is , becomes the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; in the input of many wast@@ ed @-@ coated groups @-@ brack@@ ets can quickly go out quickly , if this command as@@ certain@@ ed the last group , so that the wast@@ ed structure of the &amp; Tex ; -@@ groups are not scattered . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the purpose of pur@@ pos@@ ing implementation is used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the sign &quot; &quot; for two simple letters &quot; &quot; is used . &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; this case , knows this case and con@@ cludes two close initial letters for &quot; &quot; &amp; lat@@ ex &quot; . &quot; &quot;
this automatic inser@@ tion of double beginnings can be set up under settings K@@ ile ... La@@ TeX and can be cut off .
&quot; you can also use L@@ Ã ¤ n@@ der@@ specific settings ( e.g. n@@ german or French ) , and therefore German or French conditions . there are also many other languages available . &quot;
&quot; in the print of Shift ; Input Chann@@ els &amp; k@@ ile ; an intelligent inter@@ ruption change . if the current position within a lists of lists ( such as en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , for example , not only a po@@ inters , but at the same time the command \ \ item . &quot;
&quot; within a tables environment , t &amp; k@@ ile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with an end @-@ end model line . &quot;
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to support pres@@ et &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom @-@ defined environments . this enables to set up under settings k@@ ile ; establish ... La@@ TeX added .
&quot; some users want to arrange the columns in tables and thereby all E@@ t signs ( amp ; ) among each other . &amp; k@@ ile ; seeks to emp@@ ower it . while this tab@@ ulator is not the per@@ plex@@ ity , for the table position of the current tab@@ ulator . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; Kate ; already has a good source text system , these in &amp; k@@ ile ; for special orders ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) still expanded . there are three different modes of working with settings K@@ ile . all these modes can set up for different working methods . &quot;
&quot; when you start a new environment using the command \ \ BE@@ G@@ IN { Sur@@ round@@ ings } , &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically the command \ \ end { surroundings } after an empty line ( for the text ) . &quot;
&quot; in the print key , the last letter of the input will be removed and m@@ Ã ¶ le ER@@ T is thereby the complete list . on the other hand , the list may be reduced by entering a further letter also . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively you can also use &amp; k@@ ile ; alternatively you can choose jumping on these positions by means of machining jumping stamps , and the weigh@@ ted parameter then captured . &quot;
&quot; under settings k@@ ile ; setup ... k@@ ile ; possible settings to these lists are made . it is possible to use various wine @-@ lists for &amp; Tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands , as well as expan@@ se of common language use . &quot;
&quot; the command mode is for full use of environments not n@@ Ã ¼ y . it is always a few letters associated with \ \ BE@@ G@@ IN , and the call of the complete mode will be used to follow . on the other hand , the environments are so often used that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for the app@@ ellation of the environments . &quot;
&quot; in the call of the land mode , the menu item or the short@@ cut off , the command to become un@@ folded and it appears \ \ BE@@ G@@ IN { . after that , the environment can be continued in the easiest way and can be termin@@ ated by pressing the entry . &quot;
&quot; once this is accomplished , the environment will automatically be closed again . once &amp; k@@ ile it recognis@@ es that it is a lists of lists and is still a first \ \ item command . &quot;
under settings k@@ ile ; setup ... k@@ ile ; possible settings to these lists are made . this mode uses the wa@@ it@@ ching mode for land mode for &amp; Tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands .
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; supported user @-@ defined lists of det@@ ach@@ ments , which can be used immediately by filling under settings K@@ ile . as an example of a log list , the file exam@@ ple@@ .c@@ w@@ l , in which , for example the entry L = \ \ La@@ TeX is included . &quot;
&quot; for example , the letter L entered and the word dism@@ iss@@ ful mode displayed , the letter L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ TeX . &quot;
&quot; rough quality , for automatic sc@@ iss@@ ors are not helpful . however , that many walls have been written in a document more than once , so it offers &amp; k@@ ile ; the en@@ coding for all already written wound . &quot;
&quot; this mode can set up in the menu of K@@ ile ... K@@ ile Ver@@ sions can be seen . here , the threshold for the display of the assignment shall be specified . &quot;
the full @-@ condition files can be used in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ ile / / / mode / a personalized Home folder . mode stands for con@@ dens@@ ation ( apost@@ asy ) or Tex does not exist .
&quot; the dialog &apos;s dialog is designed as simple as possible , as well as possible to understand the bases of the basics of the graphics formats , the sections should be controlled and observed . &quot;
&quot; PS files are not as known as PDF files , but offer an excellent base for loads and new to @-@ end pages . will use the pages with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; the tools can be newly arranged and then with ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file . &quot;
&quot; to use the outcome of the work , the source text must be compiled , all the tools are group@@ ed in the men@@ tioning comp@@ iling , create conversion and creating view . &quot;
for comp@@ iling the source code for viewer like &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be the keyboard short@@ cut by the old ; 2 times the DVI ; -@@ file converted into a PS file and be viewed by the old ; 5 the PS file can be viewed .
&quot; when using the command fast , it is usually called a viewer after comp@@ iling . should not be used in a new window , each becomes a new window . &quot;
a new project is called the project new project .... here you will find the following information for the project :

the script function of &amp; k@@ ile ; allows the design of EC@@ MA@@ Script -@@ Ko@@ de . the scripts can be managed in the sender of scripts .
the API @-@ scripts have not yet been developed yet and can be used in other versions of &amp; k@@ ile ;
first must be said that the export environment of scripts in &amp; k@@ ile ; a system @-@ wide object ( = k@@ ile ) has the following methods :
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a very sophisticated system to be expanded in which the basic functions can be expanded through a wide range of additional items . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers a lot of different help for supporting the user .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ tures ; are supplied with many documents . this includes a documentation for the included packages and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
a fully @-@ heart@@ ed Re@@ ef for &amp; Tex ; and this is not only a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather it is a fully automated manual for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands and is therefore ideal for searching for a certain form@@ atting . since it is a very large document it is divided into &amp; k@@ ile ; into three major book@@ marks .
&quot; due to the amount of documents with those &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; delivered , the finding of the right document is not always easy . as well as appropriate assistance provides &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ tures ; the small application of tex@@ t@@ k , which provides a database with all to &amp; k@@ ile ; available documents and here for a graphical surface . &quot;
all documents are divided into categories and the gray advantage is the search for par@@ cel name or stroke . of &amp; k@@ ile ; then only the results are displayed .
double @-@ click with the mouse or the desired space for the viewer .
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener and user @-@ friendly &amp; lat@@ ex ; - / Tex ; -@@ source Editor , which can be rot@@ ated on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ de ; jobs and Unix ; is also a part of the Fink project , allowing &amp; k@@ ile ; also available on &amp; Mac ; with installed OS X output . &quot;
&quot; much thanks to those who are continuing to continue the &amp; k@@ ile ; project aims and for many hours for the development of tools , which we can use all in compliance with the &amp; GNU / GNU license . &quot;

enter the name of the file as the result is supposed to . the file is usually stored in their home folder .
&quot; the plugins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , have come with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even little to do . thus , the plug @-@ in system will benefit from the extra functionality and do not wait until someone can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; more information can be found below . &quot;
&quot; to install a plugin or a K@@ Part , we begin using the menu plugins . so that the following dialogue will be opened : &quot;
this dialog allows to manage all the plugins and add new plugins . we describe every &amp; GUI ; -@@ element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a memory location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to search of plug @-@ ins .
often work on a project several persons in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship with each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with shift ; F@@ 7 project @-@ properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nickname is the nickname of the user and serves to clear identification .
&quot; one member can have several roles in the project , such as team leader as well as sub@@ project leader . &quot;
the user can look out from the list of members of members who he is . this is done by pressing the team member from the list and the button will be pressing as pressing . the currently selected Member ( its identity ) appears after you are : text .
&quot; name and setting of their own identity is important regarding messages and comments , see for further information . &quot;
&quot; apart from the overview of their team there is another advantage by collecting members of the team : it can be created an event for information about the team leaders , if something particular occurs . see for further information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that are carried out when a certain particular project happens . an example would draw up the opening of the opening and closing of the project , so much someone can work on how a file is secured , or a script that will add a file to CV@@ S as soon as it is added to the project . &quot;
&quot; on the page event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project settings , there can be events created , edited and deleted . &quot;
&quot; an email is sent to the address selected in the recipient list . the Ad@@ res@@ sat can be a team or sub@@ project manager . see in , wei such manager will be set up . &quot;
comments are special comments in the documents . you are different from normal comments using the following things :
notes to enter comments is simple . it can be chosen either the note entry from the editor @-@ context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key word in a commentary area followed by an@@ ing@@ text .
&quot; notes can be sent a single member of the team . in this case , the nickname de@@ x@@ ot@@ ation of the team is played , the role played a role in the project from the following possibilities : team leader Head of Sub@@ project leaders should be specified the respective branch - or sub @-@ project names , as in the following examples below . &quot;
&quot; name and roles names are independent of large or small no@@ un@@ cement , but spaces around the br@@ aces and the : make the note un@@ folding . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and form@@ atting languages that is D@@ TD @-@ diagnostic table and web@@ based form@@ atting and scrip@@ ting languages supported .
&quot; the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only via &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a brief description for the others can be found in . &quot;
the settings can be set up by using settings Qu@@ anta ... . diesel dialog extends over some pages that are dealt with each other .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags including car rental may be modified . the entries are :
large / low @-@ off of tags : large / low @-@ off of automatically lod@@ ged tags . normal wholes@@ ale / small @-@ scription means the tags will be inserted as inserted in the tag@@ XML files .
large / low @-@ off of attri@@ bu@@ cks : large / low @-@ off of automatically inde@@ struc@@ ted attributes . normal wholes@@ ale / inf@@ lic@@ ations means that the attributes are described as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
&quot; optional tags automatically closing : if raised , will be optional for tags , for which the final day is optional , this immediately after the &amp; gt ; &quot;
not optional tags automatically closing : how above all the other tags except the simple tags .
&quot; start @-@ up and closing day automatically update : if switched on , the corresponding final day will be changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic detection of acc@@ ent signs : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated signs into the appropriate en@@ coding during inser@@ ting .
M@@ IME types : Mim@@ eti@@ zation can be recovered for detection of different types of files . using the button standard can be restored the default ones .
standard string : the coding of newly created or used in other ways than with Open Open files ( where the coding of the file may be passed ) but this setting is displayed here from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
&quot; standard D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD is used for newly created files , or for Files whose D@@ TD is not recognized . this setting is displayed here however from the same in the project features , if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; generate regularly backup copies , so that in case of an black@@ out or crash in the next start of the program the document is recovered . also for even stored documents is created a backup regularly , according to the given time created . &quot;
&quot; the Preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor or a separate view ( or documentation in a box ) , which makes it possible to look at the documentation , the Preview and the source text at the same time . &quot;
put the window settings back on the standard back to the next start is useful when the user interface through modi@@ fying the MDI modes and an@@ do@@ cks / depend on views through each other . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ rack command line parameters .
the War@@ n@@ mel@@ e area serves the tax of the possibility to disable war@@ nings by means of warning by means of non @-@ extr@@ adi@@ tion .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can be specified the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ izing behavior of the V@@ PL@@ e and the source text in its shared mode . with regard to the different modes .
&quot; here , the Par@@ ser and the Struc@@ tured tree , which represents the illustration of the Par@@ ser @-@ node in the document , in detail . &quot;
&quot; in the area of mouse click on the structural tree , the following action is possible to change the action by clicking the structural tree with the mouse buttons . &quot;
&quot; in the field of structural @-@ tree settings , the visibility of the tree can be opened automatically in the tree , the actu@@ ality of the tree , when machining and how deep in changing the structure tree will be adjusted . blank groups are those empty areas in the text , while empty groups are not found in the current document . &quot;
&quot; the area for organizing the abbrevi@@ ations ( a kind of templates ) that will be un@@ fol@@ ds in groups , each can be divided for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s , it can be a valid group for PHP where the i@@ f@@ le abbrevi@@ ation is slightly different than in a group valid for Javascript . &quot;
&quot; here , the plug @-@ ins can be managed . plugins are K@@ part applications from third @-@ third page , which can be re @-@ used by every part @-@ capable application , on the most known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in must be specified : &quot;
&quot; address : the path to the plugin , if it is not in a stand there such as $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib . &quot;
&quot; input : this information will be delivered to the plugin when starting , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
&quot; component in &quot; &quot; Only @-@ read &quot; mode : check whether the plugin uses its loading . only @-@ read @-@ K@@ parts usually refuse to load , if this option is not selected . &quot;
&quot; check the plugin : is this activated , then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the entered information is correct , then if the plugin is not available at the moment but it should be installed later . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , the trou@@ bleshooting was completely re@@ developed . the support for the no more necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger was adjusted , as well as support for the db@@ g Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead of this a de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in concept was implemented , the various impl@@ ement@@ ations made via plug @-@ ins . &quot;
&quot; currently only a plugin available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; in@@ qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; adds . &quot;
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with selecting a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the button options next to the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin you can change the specific settings .
&quot; if a de@@ bu@@ gger is activated for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ interface : &quot;
a view that is displayed in the content of over@@ alert variables . usually appears in the left dock .
&quot; a view , where all shelf points , with line numbers and terms are listed . usually appears in the lower dock . &quot;
a view that is shown in the output ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger . usually appears in the lower dock .
&quot; depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything is available or part of the following functionality . &quot;
&quot; with this action , the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger , if required , or she shares the plugin with , to listen to de@@ bug requirements . this action is opened by default if a project is opened , which must not be considered a de@@ bu@@ gger , so it does not have to be respected . &quot;
the counter@@ part of de@@ bug@@ ging session Star@@ te the session . closes the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger or ends the lu@@ de according to requirements .
sending a HTTP @-@ request to the server to address a de@@ bug request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this requirement is displayed in the viewing de@@ bu@@ gger edition .
&quot; points the de@@ bu@@ gger to begin with the execution of script and information on the above variables , as well as the current @-@ current variable , the execution will be continued during the script , the script will start with the request . &quot;
&quot; to send the de@@ bu@@ gger , with the execution of script to start , without information on more alert variables and the current line number . if this happens , while a script is running out , the version runs before a request is placed . &quot;
the de@@ bu@@ gger leads the next statement in the script without entering the functions or includes .
the de@@ bu@@ gger leads the next statement in the script when it is possible to function in functions and includes error @-@ adjusted .
&quot; points the de@@ bu@@ gger , to move the statement and go to the next one , as if there was the current one . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog in which a variable or an expression can be entered , the super@@ vised value appears in the variable view . &quot;
this dialog can be given an variable or set a new value of a variable .

this chapter describes how you can customize &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to meet your needs and how you can help &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; better to become better .
&quot; documentation type E@@ di@@ tier@@ i ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; abilities to provide support for Mark@@ up@@ - and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS ; allows for easy , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; a quick , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web development , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and the toolbar . tag allows two file types , the &amp; E@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and day XML files with the extension .@@ tag@@ onal window ) , add text and instructions to add faster to a document than a user ever could . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or created automatically from an existing D@@ TD . see for details on conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how to create new XML files , then the &amp; tri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also work@@ pieces . briefly , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
t@@ XML files ( .@@ day ) define the specific attri@@ bute for tags and the layout and content of the self @-@ fac@@ ebook ; the &amp; tri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even work@@ pieces enable fast inser@@ tion of tags into a document without a risk of writing .
&quot; tag folder are nothing as a folder . they contain only the &amp; tri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . day folders carry the name of the descri@@ p@@ tive language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.01 @-@ ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML to and declar@@ es whether they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible to give other users a better insight and more information about working with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes every element in detail . everything about possibilities and boundaries is explained in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of a day @-@ document document . it can only happen once in a document . it may contain the definition of many tags , but it does not contain any element type over himself . &quot;
the type of tags is a script function . when using it &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the class type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only for the type of Meth@@ od . returns the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the day has a living attri@@ bute and the attributes within this tags may be added to any other day . ( only family 1 ) &quot;
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; -@@ day . this is a only element type element .
&quot; describes an attri@@ bute of a tags . this element can only appear once for any attri@@ bute . it lays the name and the type of the attri@@ bute . in addition , there are further tags , descri@@ bing how this attri@@ bute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; this is a only element element . &quot;

a container day that is group@@ ed together with the elements of a list . it can only happen for an attri@@ bute description only once . it is a only element of element .
sets the position of the attri@@ bute of a tags within a dialog box . this day can occur for any attri@@ bute in a dialog only once ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the element is empty .
returns the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be present in the dialog box ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; E@@ col@@ r &gt; Day ) . this item is empty .
returns a list of elements that may occur within the required tags . this element is a single element .
returns a list of elements that end one day . this element is a single element .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with an &amp; XML ; -@@ declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 en@@ coding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be re@@ structured and closed .
&quot; spaces affect nothing , but watch on &amp; and &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; Tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; to be replaced , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
to review the Tag@@ XML files is the tools dialog top in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; Start to start and over@@ check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . an additional dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions .
this function is currently not available . currently the inspection occurs only when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ;
in the following an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes this &amp; b ; scheme &gt; element in the &amp; W@@ 3C ; &amp; XML ; -@@ pattern . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ loading function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file is supposed to be over@@ lo@@ ad@@ .@@ day .
&quot; &amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; en@@ coding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; day name = &quot; &quot; function &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &quot;
the &amp; tri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just fairly simple and there is an editor to be att@@ ain@@ able via D@@ TD Bear@@ be@@ ite D@@ TD settings . this can be edited by a list of sel@@ ectable &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created a simple &amp; tri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; version = use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = D@@ TD HTML 4.01 Tran@@ si@@ tional / / EN ) Nickname = The simplified name of the D@@ TD . ( HTML 4.01 Tran@@ si@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as a nickname . &quot;
an action can specify with settings actions ... created . click New Promotion leads to the same dialog :
the short@@ cut short@@ cut . by clicking the button to be user @-@ defined a keyboard short@@ cut ; using K@@ one is the current keyboard short@@ cut .
&quot; the simpl@@ est actions . it can be inserted in the det@@ ai@@ ed settings and inserted in the execution of the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the sample below . &quot;
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action you can use external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) to change the document or use the document ( or parts of the document ) . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; examples are the quick start -@@ dialog , or the different graphics in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ EPs . &quot;
&quot; first , the name of the script and interpre@@ ter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scri@@ pt@@ .@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scri@@ pt@@ dir / share / apps / qu@@ anta / scrip@@ ting folder : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / scrip@@ ts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in the command line : &quot;
% f : we will be replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file will be removed : / from the document name .
&quot; % pi@@ d : is replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance is running , the text will be unique to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used by the external script . &quot;
&quot; the parameters for this event , normally the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or the path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the above mentioned methods , a script may be taken by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in the default file input can be determined to send to the standard input . possibilities are : &quot;
selected text : the selected range of the document is sent to the script . the % input is usually only useful with this setting .
&quot; corresponding to the input may also be re@@ directed to the issu@@ ing of the application . there are two types of output : normal edition , which can be specified on the default edition . it can be specified with which to set the default output text , by which the value is set to the selection output : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the aw@@ up language , it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups . in any case , it is not too many , so you can create a toolbar with the name of the mark@@ ups . &quot;
&quot; once a work@@ station is added , you need to add actions and configure . select Settings can be set . &quot;
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Promotion button at the bottom of the window starts the Edit Mode .
fill in all the required fields and add the day to the suitable work@@ station .
&quot; complete everything and , if the tag attributes , and you plan their use , enable dialogue &quot; &quot; to edit &quot; &quot; if available , so that a input when entering the action is possible . &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is that an ugly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? replace it before we have difficulty .
&quot; to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; select other programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses by default 32@@ x@@ 32 Pixel , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size from others . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created icon not only helps you to remember what the action is doing , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . &quot;
&quot; with regard to that the day start , I decided to create a kick button as a symbol . through the use of green ( green is usually interpreted as a symbol , rigid , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user sign@@ aled that assu@@ mp@@ ed this symbol ; start @-@ day in the current document . &quot;
&quot; after the creation of the symbol , it must be connected with the action . this happens through the menu using settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selection of the desired action . besides the text box there is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder where the stored symbol is , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the contact button and continue using any other tags , so there are still what is , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot;
&quot; suppose you want to complement some usual &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions to the toolbar panel , or it should be set to the better overview by some separ@@ ators set into several groups . make sure that the toolbar panel is selected . &quot;
&quot; I want to choose the separ@@ ator ( quite left up ) for my toolbar . according to the selection of the item , that can be added to the toolbar button , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I want to add a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or Preview . I will choose it and add it to the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; please note , as the separ@@ ators support group@@ ing . anyone who knows the toolbar , could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button is the opposite of the start @-@ button . &quot;
&quot; the new toolbar must be tested by pro@@ filing all symbols in order to ensure that everything works . &quot;
&quot; secure in the right folder . after real@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be im@@ regular folders , but your toolbar ( s ) should be loaded in the right folder , so that their toolbar ( s ) will be loaded ( s ) if a file is opened by the appropriate type . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the worth men@@ tioning of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the form@@ atting , that you like most . therefore describes this chapter as I create a &amp; PHP ; -@@ documentary tree for my personal use . &quot;
&quot; before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory if anyone has done this for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you must search an existing documentation for the form@@ atting / script / etc . language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . the first part we leave you , the second one we treat it here . &quot;
# KDE Con@@ figuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc You = path to load relative to this file for instance ph@@ p@@ 42 / # Sec@@ 2.2 . # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 . 1 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 2.@@ html
the section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the document tree . for example you can see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation is something :
# KDE config file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc &#91; Tree &#93; Doc You = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level = Top element = introduction ... introduction ... introduction = Frequ@@ tion@@ .html ... Language Reference = Basic syntax ... Basic syntax = langu@@ ag@@ e.@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .html ...
be aware of the # before getting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that it is a sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known border for the chess speakers ( except by reason ) m@@ das@@ h ; but try it yourself .
note that the index is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consistent at the top of the tree @-@ view &amp; m@@ das@@ h ; folder displayed ! ) .
&quot; spaces affect nothing , but watch on &amp; and &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; res@@ sources . &quot;
&quot; the table cut is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file that serves as part of the counter@@ part sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP / fetch _ array function , the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file binding . &quot;
&quot; a simple list of by complem@@ ented context @-@ elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) . &quot;
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c and save to $ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( like you have specified it in your file cr@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
&quot; if you are sure that these are good and it worth to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation have been used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory will not be rich with the best web development platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; are you not alone . it is possible to divide the ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , work@@ pieces with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; the resources may send by e @-@ mail to friends , partners or otherwise to whom you will send an email menu entry , such as D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with e @-@ mail , toolbar panel with email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts . &quot;
&quot; the resources can be up@@ loaded into our main archive , from where all others &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can download them . the contributions are checked and only available when our team needs them as correct and usable for publication , where our team needs them as correct and usable for the publication . this will ensure the origin of resources , both for our team and for the later users . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading , you will be asked for their private G@@ PG key ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event you have multiple keys you can choose to check out . in the dialogue of New resource required ( URL preview may stay empty ) and click on OK to upload the upload . &quot;
&quot; the upload can upload by the menus D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , toolbar panel , and in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , still before installing , studied &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the irre@@ conc@@ ession of the resource by checking the integrity and Sig@@ nific@@ ation . in case of problems the integrity and the resource can be broken carefully . if the integrity is given and the resource correctly signed , a message appears with the specification of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work on XML languages , which is currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the creation can be time @-@ consuming , because hundreds of day files in the tag@@ XML format could be necessary . there is the easiest way to convert a D@@ TD automatically into a D@@ TE@@ P package . &quot;
&quot; the conversion can be started by the D@@ TD charging and Convert a D@@ TD . select the .@@ dt@@ d file with the D@@ TD description , which shall be used . after that , the following dialogue will appear : &quot;
target directory : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; will be written in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! DO@@ C@@ TY@@ PE Defin@@ i@@ fications : the character string that will appear in the ! DO@@ C@@ TY@@ PE Tag as HTML Public - / / W@@ 3C / / D@@ TD HTML 4.01 Tran@@ si@@ tional / / D@@ TD HTML 4.01 Tran@@ si@@ tional / / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ ml@@ 4 / Tags e.@@ dt@@ d .
&quot; fine @-@ adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if activated , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; following the conversion the &amp; tri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; Editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this opportunity . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . in order to understand and get full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , one must first get acquainted with these fundamental concepts . this chapter is trying to customize them precisely these concepts without understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; little Ben@@ ef@@ ulness . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the work@@ space is divided into three areas : global , local and project related . this distinction involves a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for each , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this enables the group of administr@@ ators about actions that is globally marked , in common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this enables the group of administr@@ ators diverse work@@ pieces , actions and patterns in the global tree to be available to anyone in a multi @-@ user environment . &quot;
local elements represent a personal collection of web developers for a single user . these are user @-@ specific pattern and materials handling . local items are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
&quot; project @-@ related items are only available within a specific project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; -@@ patterns to work with special actions especially for the files of a specific project . simply said , this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which allows the sharing of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ MDI ; consists of several main areas : the Edit@@ ors , the Bau@@ man@@ ag@@ ites , with info and the toolbar . please turn in , and for further information on these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click the box , to get a context menu with the right mouse button to re@@ load a context menu with the current documents , re@@ load , delete or up@@ loading of the document , jump to a book@@ marks or execution of CV@@ S command to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right @-@ click in the Edit@@ ors section guide to another context menu on the processed document contents , how basic machining steps ( cut / paste ) , editing of under the mouse cursor , or opening the file , when the string under the mouse cursor is called a file . &quot;
&quot; at the top of the Edit@@ or@@ window , the toolbar can be shown . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.01 Tran@@ si@@ tional as standard , for which a set of work@@ pieces will be shown . in the course of further development of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the toolbar can be adapted to the new features and associated user needs . &quot;
&quot; the use of work@@ pieces is really easy . if they want to insert in their document , then click on the icon that the day represents , then you can insert the data for this straight , then you can insert a day to fill out several attributes ( such as anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog various fields . &quot;
&quot; the Build@@ ings ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow it to navigate in the information on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; navigate to open and tran@@ sit@@ ing . in the presentation with Kart@@ ei@@ re@@ ites stand for files , project , templates , script , attributes and documentation construction . &quot;
&quot; project Management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this view displays all the files in the project and allows the st@@ ew@@ ing of files in the project using the right mouse click . actions like adding , un@@ loading , upload or delet@@ ing the files from storage media can be performed with the then shown context menu . &quot;
&quot; another way of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the use of templates . almost everything can be a template , pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . all possibilities are open to you . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories , depending on how they are used . the category depends on the corresponding users and templates in projects are available only in the project . more on templates will be found in . &quot;
&quot; here you will find information on the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of the integration in Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking on the right mouse button you can retrieve the available information on a script . via the right mouse button are available for further functions , such as the script should be sent , edit or send by mail . &quot;
&quot; with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . through links @-@ click of an element , the cursor will be placed on the position of the element . through right @-@ click of an element opening a list of commands in terms of navigation and refres@@ her of the tree . &quot;
&quot; this tree appears under the other construction views . with it , you can change rapidly attributes and nam@@ esp@@ ace . this allows the change of all available attributes with few clicks . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation on Web @-@ technology for your development can be found . it can be downloaded documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; documentation website can be downloaded , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be attached to project specific documentation . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus comes with two boxes , at the bottom of the window , about the beneficial information can be reached : the message window and the problem window . &quot;
&quot; this cart@@ on , shows information about each in Qu@@ anta current script . such , the D@@ TD of the current document and all changes to the D@@ TD . &quot;
&quot; this card leader shows all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts , which will be run , give all error messages ( as there are ) in this window . &quot;
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; work@@ pieces are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the respective command displayed . the Chocolate page is the possibility to define own prec@@ epts as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ;
&quot; another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a work@@ top with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; sent the toolbar as a comp@@ ressed T@@ ar archive over &amp; k@@ mail ; if they receive a toolbar in an email , they can secure it in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; how to secure and load them ! &quot;
&quot; it is reasonable , if you want to adjust the place of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; auto@@ conf may want to adapt to your system . it has a complete list of options available to the configure script , type . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not run here . &quot;
&quot; if you have problems when st@@ ump &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder contains . also you should ensure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in PAT@@ H in front of their bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the KDE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a multitude of powerful functions .
&quot; during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; the editor began to create , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; an independent , expan@@ dable mark@@ up languages would be ? well , this would make it an absolutely great Web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive Web development tool . together , if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , should be the appropriate &amp; IDE ; &quot;
&quot; well , to the above @-@ mentioned requirements must be stated that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; development community is based not only this is possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to extend , as they need it for their need . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; allows web developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( MDI ; ) . this can enlarge productivity almost every task . by means of self @-@ drawn promotions , scripts and toolbar without having to remember a scrip@@ ting language . ( more about them can be found in . ) &quot;
&amp; qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for rapid web development and quickly expanded into a well @-@ engine@@ ered editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; qu@@ anta ; the original developer left the GPL @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more in the details @-@ depth documentation is with help : / qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ help@@ center help : / qu@@ anta run ) . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ anta ; is currently developed and super@@ vised by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon sequ@@ it@@ ur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time when you open a file , which is not on it , with the oldest entry . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . look at the section on templates . should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project pre@@ storage device , only a mistake is reported . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ ts the inser@@ tion from the clip@@ board there , special characters to &amp; HTML ; -@@ Notes , so that they are displayed correctly and not understood by the browser as form@@ atting assignment . &quot;
conver@@ ts the text from the clip@@ board in &amp; URL ; -@@ Notes containing the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . first and foremost to the inser@@ tion &amp; URL ; s in the anchor day .
switch the block@@ ages to or from . that allows you to choose text blocks with the help of the &amp; Shift .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful when your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script is out !
seeking a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expres@@ sions to help you .
shows the message window or not an . this is the window in which you see the display of scripts and de@@ bu@@ gger .
&quot; initial and switching of the problem por@@ ters at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem @-@ por@@ ter is activated , once you switch to the structural tree . &quot;
shows the sheet @-@ old left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a click @-@ click .
&quot; if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu together with the entries of previous or neighbour@@ ly , depending on the position of the cursor in the document . &quot;
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu group@@ ed after the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
open an existing project from the hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog to insert files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied into the project directory .
search the project directory according to new files that could be there . this allows for example to copy graphics files into your project folder or sub@@ folders and then add them to the project .
loads the files in your project to the server high . the list of available conveyor methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded one input / output modules ( K@@ IO Sl@@ aves ) .
&quot; settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project manages . in the chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects can be found for details . &quot;
loads a project tool . these are stored in project you / tool@@ ing and are only stored in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
&quot; a dialog to store your toolbar . allows you to select the type of the toolbar : local or project . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog to add a new toolbar . this creates only the name . actions are stored by means of settings ... added by using settings , or you will be asked if you want to store the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; remove a toolbar from the point of view . delet@@ es it not from the hard disk . if you have not saved the toolbar , you will be asked if you want to do that . &quot;
&quot; with this , you can send your own toolbar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ team , thus the toolbar available in the next publication is available ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as attached . &quot;
&quot; allows the upload of work@@ es to the main server , where everyone can access it . see in . &quot;
&quot; invite one &amp; D@@ TD ; that has made you or anyone else , and convert into the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own right @-@ format . &quot;
&quot; loaded / refresh the entities from the &amp; D@@ TD ; it is useful , if the entities should be re@@ printed out of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this globally is and a write @-@ in in the global KDE folder is not available , the loading . &quot;
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags , which are available in the currently invited toolbar , is available in the Tags menu a sub@@ menu standard , which contains list of tags / actions on this toolbar . &quot;
&quot; allows access to the current day setup dialog , if there is one . this entry is always present in the menu tags , followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; -@@ specific sub @-@ men@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; enabled or de@@ activated the intelligent inser@@ tion of tags . currently this works only with ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ tion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the inser@@ tion by tool @-@ toolbar , if this day speaks to the rules of this place . &quot;
&quot; in the plugins menu , the available plugins are listed below the items listed above . click on . click on an activated plug @-@ in . &quot;
sel@@ ects the syn@@ tac@@ tic mode for the current file . the list of available herbal codes depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; -@@ version .
&quot; choose the type of po@@ inters identifi@@ er . very useful when you know people , the other OS platforms to use . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh . &quot;
check the syntax of the current document with the selected &amp; D@@ TD ; using the external application .
immediate inter@@ connection between the different types of the user interface . due to some limitations in the KDE libraries you can cause time or un@@ nice graphics mode . recommended is the box mode that is also the default setting mode that is also the default setting mode that the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier .
&quot; in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub@@ window . with a selection of an entry , the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated . &quot;
the display of the status bar on the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window is connected or off .
&quot; the changes in this dialog can be influenced by any application that use the K@@ HTML Part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser . &quot;
sets the behaviour of the Edit@@ or@@ window . in the documentation of &amp; Kate ; you can find details .
&quot; a dialog will be published in which you can delete items from the toolbar , or which you can change and follow the sequences . &quot;
&quot; this should generate a help according to the environment of the mouse , but is not implemented yet . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with every open source project the developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find here the way . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled up from top down , as after filling out the project called the whole directories structure for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields may be completed later with shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties are adjusted . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project to include , for example fo@@ o . in the input of name it will be automatically filled . &quot;
&quot; this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project @-@ file . by default , it has the name of the project in small letters ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is saved in the project directory . &quot;
&quot; here you can access the server address of the machine , which you want to access , except the local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ bit@@ .de ) or an IP @-@ address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected log file will be used . depending on the setting of the remote host may be required . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where the templates will be stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a common collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where the toolbar can be saved for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ ing . if a common collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
that allows to insert files from the local fil@@ es@@ ystem to the project . it can be selected multiple files or whole folders .
&quot; this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . on ser@@ vers@@ y script ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently . &quot;
&quot; extract that files that are involved somewhere in the main folder of the project . if a project is beginning to new , not starter . &quot;
this option will display all the files and folders within the main folder and you can make a precise selection according to vou@@ ch .
&quot; this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by a hook or , by removing the tick , clips from the project . &quot;
the latest screen of the new project assist@@ ants contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be up@@ loaded in the menu with project properties in the sub @-@ window profile or be modified using the keyboard short@@ cut ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project assist@@ ants and are described in . the additional entries will be explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ame ( wild@@ card possible ) to be re@@ ignored in project related operations such as project folder .
&quot; additional option to above , also files that are listed in .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project . &quot;
the project view is loaded when opening the project . in order to read more about project views .
thus the desired de@@ bu@@ gger can be selected . at present only Gub@@ ed is supported . more information about Gub@@ ed is available in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin can be adjusted using the button options .
&quot; in the sub @-@ window profiles , up@@ loading profiles can be set ( see in ) as well as the display of a building view for the content of the server for each profile , adding a separate construction view for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list for details . see the details . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window event , one can switch events @-@ actions and add these actions to change or delete these actions , if a previously defined event occurs , such as the f@@ uses of a file . see the details . &quot;
&quot; standard opens &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project , which was opened . this behavior can not currently not affect . &quot;
to open another project you select project ... coming from the menu project or the icon project open from the toolbar . the dialog project is displayed and allows you to choose a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
&quot; if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file will be automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving you . the same happens when you load a new project . &quot;
project management provides free access to the files in the project . there can be managed the files in the current project .
&quot; folder also act , however , the entries opening Open and opening with ... in with the right mouse button on the map menu : &quot;
here you can be selected different profiles . the profile contains information on the site of the up@@ loading files .
&quot; allows removing the current profile . if only a profile exists , the button b@@ bor@@ ed to prevent the Rem@@ ove . &quot;
&quot; the password will keep in the core memory and forgotten when it is useful , if most frequent upload of files is needed and the more uns@@ afe password on the plate is not saved . &quot;
&quot; this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog , if you change your opinion before up@@ loading . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many high @-@ loads profiles can be up@@ loaded and up@@ loaded with the project ( or parts of the project ) to various servers . when you edit or create a profile , this dialog is displayed : &quot;
that &apos;s the server name to which the files are to be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address function .
the transfer protocol for the up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed K@@ IO slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( locally ) and n@@ fs . &quot;
&quot; the port for transfer . normally , this does not have to be changed , except the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your spru@@ ce , this is either a time @-@ saving function or danger . use them according to your discretion . the password is saved on the plate so that it cannot be easily read , but anyone with programming knowledge can be easily seen in the plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is only one set of files and work@@ pieces . it can be in a project many views , i.e. by simple exchange of view can be loaded various files and work@@ pieces and replace the currently opened files and toolbar . &quot;
&quot; views can be saved in the menu project or the project toolbar , accessible via settings of the toolbar project toolbar , opened or deleted . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has the most to do . this helps not only increase productivity but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; at their own way of working . &quot;
&quot; as mentioned above , work@@ pieces are already mentioned in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; best suited via the menu toolbar . use and adding will be different . adding the toolbar is treated in the section Ad@@ ding of work@@ pieces . &quot;
&quot; the toolbar and symbols on this can be adjusted either by using the context menu ( right @-@ click on the toolbar ) , other actions like toolbar panel , can be specified in dialog , where actions can be visible on this or other toolbar . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a toolbar , the entries will be removed and re@@ inst@@ ated action that are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; the toolbar and the actions on them can set up in the menu with settings factory , setup ... and settings actions can be set . &quot;
&quot; templates are essentially connected to the link@@ age , code cut@@ lets and files to the link@@ age . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; uses templates in principle such as a exercise system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or any on the system &apos;s existing directory in the pre@@ storage tree ; templates in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the restrictions that one can imagine for the fil@@ es@@ ystem . &quot;
&quot; some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; included templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions at the beginning of each template , prior to use . &quot;
&quot; binary text is all that is not pure text . it may be any file except text , so images , &amp; PDF ; s , flash files &amp; etc ; binary functions are usually inserted in documents using short@@ cuts ( e.g. pictures with IMG sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in advance @-@ tree under global templates . additional information on the tree @-@ tree is available . &quot;
documents can be created by any text document type . on the basis of these templates you can be created new documents . usually makes a simple bar@@ ley for the purpose and organiz@@ es work in appropriate way to be efficient . some examples can be found in advance tree under global templates . see for more information about the templates .
&quot; this type of templates is useful , if not a new document will be inserted based on a template but the same text field is always included in the documents . you can find everything from a comment on JavaScript or Perl basis . some examples are in advance @-@ tree under global templates . see for more information about the templates . &quot;
&quot; as the name says , these templates for whole websites serves as templates . they are a collection of various documents organized in a folder structure , summar@@ ized in a comp@@ ressed t@@ ar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &quot;
&quot; shape the documentation structure for popularity ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc . ) and select a file as a template to save a local template .... &quot;
&quot; once this is done , notice that ( even if it was stored as a project window ) the template is not visible in the tree @-@ tree . look at the pre@@ disposition of the project . &quot;
select Text in your document and click File As a template to save a local / project window . alternatively the selection can easily be drag@@ ged with drag@@ ging and draw on the component man@@ ure templates .
&quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied into a pre @-@ level folder , all file management functions can be used for it , such as drag@@ ging and paste or insert the file tree from Kon@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; you can select files in the file tree or in the project files to select a folder on the right and secure a site template , secured a name for the template , but of course it can be saved as local or global template . &quot;
project requirements enable a very purpose @-@ oriented advance . you can insert head@@ lines and foot@@ lines or connect dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; additionally you can keep some things when using templates in projects very deeply in mind .
the storage structure in the sub @-@ window is based on the in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / templates . each of this folder corresponds to one of four types of containers as above .
to set the behavior of a folder is in pre@@ disposition with the right mouse button on the folder and select in the context menu properties . the following dialog will appear :
&quot; a selection with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is can@@ cel@@ ed as soon as ellip@@ tical attributes . &quot;
&quot; this is default by default and fits everything except the tri@@ parti@@ tions in the storage room . if a regular folder would be shut down , except they would be explicitly activated . in case of a normal folder , the flower would appear with something like text @-@ building . if nothing appears , one is likely to appear in a regular folder . &quot;
&quot; allowed or deleted text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ er for all templates for a specific project , allowing to equi@@ p a whole presentation with the right head@@ lines / foot@@ er lines . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you have a context menu ( on display right mouse button ) via a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and insert templates from one place to another . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; Source text editor , which is accessible via the menu View Editor . the first mode re@@ places the editing window into two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor . &quot;
&quot; the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; and then you can edit and turn on the source code editor , in which the changes carried out in the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor is visible in the source code . &quot;
&quot; working with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor to a document that includes &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; it is not possible to edit these directly with the V@@ PL ; it is still necessary to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; it is no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works just like the first , except that at the same time changes both in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor is visible and the cursor in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor is already active , puts the key@@ press to the active cursor from one window to another , while maintaining the position in the document . &quot;
the synchronization distance between the V@@ PL ; the editor and the source text editor can be set up via settings Qu@@ anta ... After selecting V@@ PL ; it is possible to set up between synchron@@ isation after a click or automatically . in principle the recommendation can be adjusted in addition to a small single switch for quick calcul@@ ators and a big donation for slow .
&quot; suppose you want to change the title of the website , so tools can be edited using un@@ visible tags in working with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor is also called if a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; it is used to change the reduction of the pad@@ lock . this makes it possible to change : &quot;
&quot; Met@@ a @-@ Tags allow the storage of information about the document itself , e.g. keywords for internet search engines . Met@@ a @-@ elements can be added by pressing the two buttons , e.g. keywords on the column names and key@@ word keywords key . &quot;
CSS rules are the new way of designing the watch of pages in the browser . you can add CSS rules with the buttons under the list or delete a change over the list is exactly as with the met@@ a @-@ elements . the editing of CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style feature by pressing on the file @-@ open button and select the appropriate file .
&quot; the use of the cursor is as in a text processing , performed by filling with the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cursor works as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing and deleted by means of rel@@ essly or remove . &quot;
&quot; inser@@ ting tags will be done in the same way over the toolbar , such as in the source text editor . it is too noted that the inser@@ tion of tags previously already existing identical tags may not be removed e.g. if an anchor day , surrounded by text it needs to be removed every other surrounding an@@ ker tag . &quot;
some toolbar such as the tables wiz@@ ard or the lists Assistant are disabled . they are later used in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release the tables or lists work can be used .
&quot; &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the investigation of styles . in contrast to other programs for style templates , the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of the style . &quot;
&quot; to compile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully compile , except &amp; k@@ de ; yet the libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ bex@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are already present in a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ; already present . &quot;

x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g covers the complete path from a fil@@ en@@ ame . fil@@ en@@ ame in the same folder as the upper@@ most loaded style en@@ ames is loaded with rel@@ ativ@@ ly path to the bench top@@ con .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l . the following entry is possible :
&quot; this command will be checked for a partial or complete match with a pre@@ age called QNAP ME or a specified model name . &amp; eg ; template is correct with each QNAP ME which contains the string template . &quot;
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the given &quot; QNAP ME &quot; will be extended according to the rules that is defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace file . X@@ SL : test@@ 1 will be extended &amp; eg ; extended to http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a ques@@ tion@@ ist holding must be dis@@ solved for the related UR@@ I and pointer number . this will be automatically executed when loading the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . holding points will be re @-@ checked shortly after the start of each run .

there are many graphical tools for the compar@@ isons . why so &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly why I wrote .
the inter@@ connection was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors were made to many changes and at the same time had corrected it in many places that had corrected it . another programmer had changed in the same file much text . the result was a lot of conflict with the merger .
&quot; the program used to me only changed the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly was changed within these lines . and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the objection had changed . the merger of these changes was a small nigh@@ tm@@ are . &quot;
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could be able to represent differences within one line and changes to white signs . later all of further useful features were added .
&quot; if you would like to compare for example quickly , just copy it to the clip@@ board and insert it in one of the compar@@ ative window . &quot;
a function made a lot of work was the compar@@ isons and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; nearly into a full file browser .
also 3 @-@ way connections will be fully supported . this is useful when two persons are working independently of one piece of co@@ ders and make changes perform . the original file allows you to edit the result . in this editor you can even edit the result . in this editor you can even edit the result . the screenshot shows three quantum files in combination :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps with the compar@@ isons and coher@@ ence complete folder . this screenshot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder inter@@ connection :
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and proo@@ fs the possibilities today today . if you have to check in Ko@@ en , you will like this function . &quot;
&quot; differences in white signs and tab@@ ulators are visible visible . if lines only differ in a certain number of white signs , one can see it at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no hass@@ le more , if J@@ em@@ and the inser@@ tion changes . ) &quot;
&quot; if a file is the same , and the other is different in a row , then the color shows that file is different . red color means that both are different to different files . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name , but in different folders , you can make the Ti@@ p@@ par@@ work by using only the fil@@ en@@ ames of the first file completely . example : &quot;
we@@ bed@@ itor folder 1 La@@ ner@@ 2 -@@ o target folder k@@ diff@@ 3 folder ner@@ ner@@ 1 folder 3 folder
&quot; opening dialog allows the manual en@@ ames of fil@@ en@@ ames , selecting the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting an recently opened file from the fol@@ dable list . you don &apos;t need to specify the third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of the differences with two files will be empty . &quot;
&quot; using the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you choose a folder , the compar@@ isons and assembling of folders will be selected , for B and C , however , a folder , then uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A to the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; if mer@@ ging is crossed , the input field becomes active and can be processed . however , it is not necessarily required to specify a output file . you can get this step later on saving . &quot;
the setup -@@ button opens a dialog with settings . here you can specify options before you start with the same / inter@@ connection .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the clip@@ board to the active comparison window . the comparison starts then . in the Open @-@ dialog you do not have to select files , you can simply connect the dialog with the Cancel button . &quot;
&quot; you can also use drag and drop , drag a file from a file manager or select text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window . &quot;
&quot; which thought is behind it ? sometimes , a file contains e.g. several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar those features are , they would have only two appropriate files to load it in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then download and compare them . now you can simply copy the relevant sections , insert and then compare . &quot;
note : currently you can draw nothing from &amp; diff@@ use ; only the case can be supported by text into a compar@@ ative window .
&quot; warning : some editors interpret the target and insert text into another program , cut and paste ( instead of copy and paste ) . in such case your original data might be lost . &quot;
&quot; in the upper part of each text@@ window , the info @-@ line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) Every@@ thing info is optional . ) Every@@ one info has a while on the line . then a small auxiliary window will display the full name . ) &quot;
&quot; the three source windows are the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed via the Settings menu ) . &quot;
&quot; when a difference is recognized , one sees in the color that file distingu@@ ishes itself . if both files differ , the pres@@ et color is different . ( colour for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files . that &apos;s in the next section ( assembling ) well . &quot;
&quot; left in addition to the text there is the combination column . if differences were found , the column shows the appropriate color . in some programming languages the color shows not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + for example , there are white signs only in character chains and comments , relevant for the Proc@@ essor and in a few , rare occasions . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line that separates the combination column from the text , is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines . if the line @-@ line is activated , the line of the converted lines is represented . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( among the compar@@ ative stern ) also has a info @-@ line with the wording issue : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; changed &#93; if you have edited the result . usually it contains the automatic assembling already text , but often it contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! to all conflicts dis@@ solved is the save de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use the buttons to noc@@ tur@@ keys / ung@@ sten conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
&quot; if only two comparison windows be used , each difference is at the same time a conflict of manual needs to be solved manually . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the left mouse button in one of the window , the first line of the group will be displayed in all windows and the first line of the group is shown . ( this will also be a jump of position in the windows , where the beginning of the group is not visible . ) This group is highlighted the color background color for current area , and each on the left appears a black beams . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , by automatic coll@@ ision , or by manual editing no more line remains in the group ; then no line will be displayed in the source ; this text is only one card holder for the event that you may change your opinion and perhaps another source . this text appears neither in the final saved file , nor in a mark@@ ings you may want to copy and how to insert it differently . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt , cl@@ apping fli@@ gt ; however , appears in the clip@@ board , if you copy such text from the result window , proceed carefully with this function . &quot;
&quot; note : if when selecting the sources , the options ignore or ignor@@ ance C / C + + comments are activated , changes in figures or comments are also treated like white signs . &quot;
&quot; navig@@ ating is mainly to use the image and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you use one of the window , you can use the arrow keys left , bottom , bottom , bottom and bus@@ g end , Si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs . &quot;
in the eye window you can also use the other buttons to edit . with the inser@@ tion button you can switch between inser@@ tion and over@@ writing mode . ( pres@@ et is the insert mode . )
one click with the left mouse button in one of the coher@@ ent columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group ( as already in the section ) and the ed@@ itable output window was explained ) .
&quot; the toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / pre @-@ previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ bottom / Str@@ g @-@ above ) , to proceed to the next / pre @-@ previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ bottom / Str@@ g @-@ Start ) or to the next / pre @-@ previous conflict , as conflict must be seen as conflict . therefore , between solved and un@@ resolved conflicts . &quot;
&quot; to copy the mark@@ ings into the clip@@ board , you need to copy the Copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ inser@@ tion ) . if this option is automatically copied , automatically turn into the clip@@ board and remove the manual copy . if you are using this option but carefully , because you could not over@@ write the contents of the clip@@ board . &quot;
&quot; po@@ inters are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix variants are using a pointer @-@ line characters \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems do not use gu@@ agen@@ b \ \ r \ . K@@ diff@@ 3 re@@ tains the pointer @-@ line files not , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; neither with binary files . &quot;
the options and the list of the most recently used files will be automatically saved and restored during the next start . ( menu adjustment &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 setup ... )
&quot; select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , dialogue also provides writings with variable width to choose from , you should not use it . ) &quot;
&quot; if you activate this option , differences in cur@@ si@@ ver script are presented . if the chosen font is not supported , nothing happens at all . &quot;
&quot; on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in its pure form but would be displayed automatically . on these systems the button of preference is automatically an odd color . &quot;
&quot; when this option is activated , when using the tab@@ ulator button the appropriate number of spaces inserted . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator sign is inserted . &quot;
&quot; if you press the return or return , the inser@@ tion of the previous line will be used automatically for the next line . &quot;
&quot; when this option is activated , each selection will automatically be copied into the clip@@ board . the manual is automatically copied into the clip@@ board . &quot;
you can choose which type @-@ type you prefer to store . the pres@@ et value is the generally usual selection of the operating system used .
&quot; at the compar@@ isons of files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first to find all completely identical lines in source files . only during this first step can be seen white characters . the second step is compar@@ es every line . in this step , white signs will not be ignored . also when connecting white signs are not ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) save a car copy &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , other again only save a line sk@@ ating &apos; \ &apos; . usually igno@@ res &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the pattern is activated , however this option must be disabled . during the merger , this option must be disabled . in the pres@@ et@@ ting it is disabled . &quot;
&quot; in the default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis figures and related signs ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) . in the result the differences are shown yet , but they are treated like white signs . &quot;
in the pres@@ et this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white signs .
&quot; intensive after even smaller differences . the option is activated in default . it is effective with complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files . &quot;
&quot; in the automatic mode mode , this setting determines how long the results of the selection will be shown before the next un@@ resolved conflict will continue . &quot;
automatically trig@@ gers all conflicts in white signs by using the chosen file as a source . ( pres@@ et is manual selection ) . note that the Automatic selection will also be used in numbers or comments if the options ignore or Ig@@ nor@@ ther@@ C / C + + -@@ comments are activated .
these options are used in the chapter on the scanning of folders and run of a union . look for details under documentation for directory comparison and assembling .
&quot; when a file is stored and already exists an older version , the original version will be attached to the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if already such back@@ up@@ file is existed with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
&quot; the language of the user interface does not fit the current program . you need to stop &amp; diff@@ use , and re@@ boot the change so that the change is active . ( this option is not available in the KDE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; it is not available because the language there is global over the control centre . ) &quot;
the following coding settings can be adjusted for each entry separately . if you activate this option is used for all entries the upper setting is used .
a quick note about the coding of code appears a short notice what the local en@@ coding is . ( this can not be changed here and has for you purely informal character . )
&quot; customize the file coding for source files . this influences , such as special characters treated and interpre@@ ting . as the coding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different coding can be compared and merged . &quot;
&quot; if you have edited a file , you can specify which en@@ coding will be used for saving . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre @-@ processing command , they might not be able to function with your co@@ dec , but the processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII code . ) With this option one can specify the coding of the output of pre @-@ processing command . &quot;
turn this to supp@@ ress changes in white signs into the text or overview page . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore or Ig@@ nor@@ ther@@ C / C + + -@@ comments are activated . )
&quot; this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences between two of three files are shown . however , B , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C is displayed in addition to the normal nor a second column column with the required information . &quot;
sometimes you want to use the available square on the screen rather for long lines . bl@@ ends just the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
ranks the comparison window by side or over@@ lap . this can also be useful for display of long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you consider the differences and then decide ab@@ rup@@ tly to perform the files together . a simple click starts the inter@@ connection and use the file names used as default file for output file . ( if this function is used to re@@ boot the inter@@ connection again then the name of the last file used will be kept . )
&quot; when reading a file it will be transferred to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command will be visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own preferences which corresponds exactly to your requirements . you can use this function for example to cut dis@@ rup@@ tive parts or to correct the inser@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file it is given first to this external command . if the command of the command is specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command will only be used in line control . you can write your own preferences set , which corresponds exactly your requirements . each input line must have a related issue line . &quot;
&quot; the idea behind it is to allow the user more flexibility when managing the Di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users want to program the well . the good news is however , that in most cases sed or perl is completely sufficient . &quot;
use this pre @-@ processing command for po@@ inters to convert : sed &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ \ \ &apos; The \ \ 1 in a row string refers to the found text in the first Kl@@ am@@ mer@@ n@@ couple . the \ \ U conver@@ ts the found text in large letters .
CV@@ S and other Ver@@ sion@@ control systems use some keywords to insert automatically created text files : \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _
&quot; while you experiment with sed , you might start to understand it and perhaps like you like this regular expression even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
the Ig@@ nor@@ ing of numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of a further pre @-@ processing command for po@@ inters &apos; s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 89.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ ach sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each hit is replaced by nothing but practically deleted . &quot;
sometimes you might want to perform multiple compositions at once . then you can use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions from each other .
&quot; instead of sed , you can also have something different such as perl use@@ . perl -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / Er@@ ror / counter &apos;@@ H@@ owever , perl requires several details . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) , perl needs only ( and ) without the imag@@ ined &apos; \ \ &apos; . example : &quot;
the data after the normal pre @-@ processor will maintain for viewing and maintain . further operations change only the data that sees the line @-@ off @-@ Al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus .
&quot; note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre @-@ processor , the pointer Proc@@ essor sees the output of the normal price @-@ processor as input . &quot;
&quot; the processor command are very useful , but as with any function , the text changes or differences , you may not notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case . &quot;
frequently you need to edit programmers in a folder many files . for this reason you can compare with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder recur@@ sively compare and merge .
... makes a suggestion for each object to create a proposal ; you can customize the proposal from the start
... can simul@@ ate the coher@@ ence and shows the simul@@ ated changes without it really perform .
... performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) .
this is the compar@@ isons and mer@@ ging of individual files very similar . you only need to open folder on the command line or in the dialog file .
&quot; when three folders will be merged , then folder 1 is used as base . if no target folder was specified , uses &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not the inter@@ connection . to start the merger , you must press the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 button . ( more details follow . ) &quot;
&quot; during the reading of the folder you will notify you a small message window on the current progress . if you v@@ om@@ iting the folder , only the files are listed until then were compared . &quot;
&quot; when the scanning the folder is completed , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left @-@ hand side , ... &quot;
each file and each folder that was found during the Scan is displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with one simple mouse click .
&quot; the folder structure is usually folded . you can click on the + / - click on the + / - click , or to use the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions all sub@@ directories , and all sub@@ directories with which you can set up all the folder and folders . &quot;
&quot; click on a file , the file will be started immediately and it appears as a comparison window . &quot;
the icon in column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in other folders , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail pane to the selected object . in such a case the merger action can not be automatically selected . if the merger will run , you will inform you about problems of this kind . &quot;
&quot; as shown in the above picture , are used in the columns A / B / C the colors red , green , yellow and black . &quot;
&quot; with identical entries , the colour is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different . &quot;
&quot; folders will be identical as the same when you are identical contents , then folder the same color . in folders the age is un@@ significant for its colour . &quot;
&quot; the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a sheet again , which is only green , then yellow is becomes yellow and later when it is old . &quot;
&quot; a and C identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if b does not exist , delete the goal , if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a and B identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target ( if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; B and C identical , but not a : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the goal , if it exists ) &quot;
... a , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if a a folder and B is a file ) : error : contradi@@ c@@ tory data types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects can not be started . &quot;
... a and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if a a folder and B is a file ) : error : contradi@@ c@@ tory data types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects can not be started .
&quot; the mode for synchron@@ ize is active , if only two folders and no explicit target folder were indicated , and if the option directories are synchron@@ ized . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action is identical , so that both folders are identical . if you have an entry ... &quot;
... A and B exist but not identical are : merge and the result in both folders . ( the user sees as the visible fil@@ en@@ ames for the output file only B ; directly after the inter@@ acting copy &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
&quot; when two folders will be combined and the option re@@ union file instead of combination ( uns@@ ure ) is activated , then a error error : files are different , but the date is identical .. sol@@ ves such errors will not be removed , the merger of the folder can not be started . &quot;
&quot; during the merger , one file will display a file after the other . you see status column shows , and accordingly other messages when something in@@ expected . if the inter@@ play is completed , you should make a last review and check if the status is all right . &quot;
&quot; if in furnishing dialog the file method of compar@@ ative method is chosen , K@@ diff@@ 3 will display additional columns . these contain the number of ast@@ eries , rede@@ emed , un@@ whit@@ ew@@ er and whit@@ ew@@ er conflicts . ( the column for rede@@ emed conflicts will only be displayed when three folders can be compared or merged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either merge the straight selected entry ( file or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries selected at once . if you have selected all inter@@ c@@ tive actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can run the inter@@ play . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you have no target folder , then in the three folder @-@ based mode C will be used as the goal in a two @-@ folder @-@ based mode , B and / or B is used as the target . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a target folder , please check if all entries may be displayed in the target folder , also in the folder structure . there are some options in the folder structure . please check these options to avoid un@@ ador@@ able surprises : &quot;
to perform all entries : select directory mounted / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the keyboard short@@ cut ) . to execute only the current entry : select action of the current module or press F@@ 6 .
&quot; if due to contradi@@ c@@ tory data types still exist , a message appears on the faul@@ ty elements . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; when you perform all entries , a dialog window will appear with the options guide , simul@@ ate and break . &quot;
select only if you want to see what would happen without the really changes . you will receive a detailed list of all actions .
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then certain actions necessary with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a combination window ( see the screenshot ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are finished using a file , select again directory / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you have not yet saved , a corresponding dialog . then leads &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a mistake , you will find a message and detailed status information . at the end of the list you will find some messages that will help you choose the cause of the problem . so you have the option to choose another action for entry or solve the problem in another way before proceeding with the inter@@ acting . &quot;
&quot; if some entries were individually combined , notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; this entries ( in the current session ) and leads them at the later date of all entries . even if the inter@@ connection has been translated or not saved , these entries will change as done . only if you change the inter@@ acting action , this entries will again be merged . &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 setup ... ) now has a section called directory connections with these options :
only files that adapt to the specified pattern are displayed in the Elem@@ ent@@ ree . separate card holder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default must not match that pattern .
&quot; Files and folders match that pattern are not displayed in the Elem@@ ent@@ ree , use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ em@@ akers : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . pres@@ et is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
&quot; Files and folders match that pattern are not displayed in the Elem@@ ent@@ ree , use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ em@@ akers : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . pres@@ et is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
ignored files that would also be ignored by CV@@ S . many autonom@@ ous files are ignored by CV@@ S . the big advantage is that this folder is specific with a .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some fil@@ es@@ ystems files have a verse -@@ attri@@ bute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems a file marked as hidden . this option can decide whether these files are to be displayed in the Elem@@ entary tree or not . this option is switched on in pres@@ et@@ ting .
&quot; with links to files : if the option is sealed , symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched on , the files are compared to which the links show . this is disabled in the default . &quot;
&quot; with links to the folder : when the option is activated , the symbolic links are compared and recur@@ sively check out . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not on possible records , guide and diff@@ use . ) This option is de@@ activated in pres@@ et@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; complete analysis of each file by and shows the statisti@@ c columns . ( the number of rede@@ emed , un@@ mon@@ ast@@ eries , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The full analysis is s@@ lower than a simple binary analysis , and much s@@ lower if it is applied to files that do not contain any text . ( provide a corresponding anti @-@ pattern ) . &quot;
&quot; if you compare large folder about a long @-@ term network , it may be faster , only the ch@@ ir@@ ation date and the file size compared to compare . this speed is a certain level of safety . please use with caution . this option is set in the default . &quot;
&quot; similarly as confidential to the ch@@ ir@@ ation date , there is no real comparison instead . the files will be identical when they &apos;re equal in size . this option may be useful if when copying the loss date . please use caution . this option is switched on in default . &quot;
&quot; enabled the synchronization mode if two folders are compared and no target folder are specified . in this mode , the proposals are identical to the merger , that both folders are identical . also the results of the combination of files are stored in both folders . this option is de@@ activated in the default . &quot;
&quot; in case there are differences , the copying of the newer file was proposed as action . ( this will be considered as uns@@ ure as it is not checked that the other file was not also modified . ) This option is de@@ activated in the default . &quot;
&quot; if a file or folder is replaced or deleted , then the original version will be ren@@ amed and receives the extension .@@ original . if an old backup file will already exist with the .@@ ori@@ g extension , this option will also be deleted . this option is also switched on . this option is switched on in pres@@ et@@ ting . &quot;
normally the folder @-@ based view remains visible ; you can switch the window buttons with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want to switch the window folder into the window @-@ menu and switch the switch between directory &amp; text window between the two views .
&quot; probably you prefer to compare a file easily by double @-@ click . however , there is also a corresponding menu entry . you can also install a single file directly without the folder menu . you can use the result , the status will be set out and the file will not be merged if you perform the folder . &quot;
&quot; this status will be lost , if you read the directory again : directory - menu : new &quot;
KDE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO @-@ slaves . K@@ diff@@ 3 uses this for reading files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folders for opening that are on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder inside a comp@@ ressed archive with a local folder .
one URL has a different syntax to local files and folders . a few things should you consider :
&quot; a path can be relatively und@@ oder . or .. it is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute . &quot;
&quot; special characters must be mas@@ hed . ( # - &gt; % 23 , space marking &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the fil@@ es@@ ystem on the server , sometimes through the protocol . it follows a brief list of constraints : &quot;
&quot; or it cannot be distinguished whether a link on a file or folder shows . then always a file is accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , SF@@ TP : ) . &quot;
there is no way to edit authorization or change @-@ date . therefore the eligi@@ bility or modification date from original . ( consider this option confidential of the size . ) ( This is only available with local files ) .
&quot; the main purpose of purpose is currently being the differences in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op will first start the built @-@ in differences . to start K@@ diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the differences view and then select In K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; normally , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two full input files . if it is used as being K@@ Part ; the name of the original files from the Patch @-@ File . then does &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files will have to exist . then starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file . &quot;
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if any of the original files exists . moreover , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since creation of the patch file . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as a part is executed , it only supports the compar@@ isons of two files , a very small toolbar and menu . the mer@@ ging or the same of folders is not supported in the box mode . &quot;
&quot; tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diff@@ 2 ( now He@@ ist there are comp@@ are ) there already . moreover , the name K@@ diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can lead to the program diff@@ use from the Di@@ ff @-@ Tool collection . &quot;
I use GPL programs already very long and I learned a lot while listening to the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programmers who went this path or get him so .
&quot; you have compiled the program from sources and configure the configure script to KDE released in / usr / local , but then KDE can not find the resources for user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you can find more information on this topic . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white signs is different , these lines will be treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line will be treated as not identical . if similar lines appear next to each other , this is this is dence but this Bec@@ is the case . &quot;
the editor notes itself for any difference in the files where he begins and where he ends . it is necessary to det@@ ach a conflict just by clicking in the source text and select the button A / B / C . this important information is however lost when the result could easily be saved as text file and it &apos;s too much effort to create extra a separate file format that could save this information .
the effort for this was to be too large . you can restore a certain version always by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text should be used another editor .
after removing text is suddenly lt ; no sr@@ c left ; appeared and the text is not clear . what does it mean and how can it be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses many colors for the highlight of differences . even more her@@ nia would be conf@@ using and lack the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and trou@@ bles came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you very much !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later .
information on how to use K@@ diff@@ 3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage .
a list of recent changes can be found at http : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ s@@ ource@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the Qu@@ ell package .
&quot; to compile &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; compile and install , use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ distribution : &quot;
&quot; KDE released the folder in your system , installed in KDE . if you are uns@@ ure , you will find further details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file . &quot;
&quot; since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake you should have no problems with comp@@ iling . should nevertheless difficulties occur , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing list of it . &quot;
cut ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Shift ) copies into the clip@@ board and delet@@ es the marked text . inser@@ ting text from the clip@@ board to the current cursor position and replace the current mark@@ ings .
&quot; showing differences : files that are identical in all folders and are not appear in the folder structure , and consequently also in the target folder . &quot;
( in the current program version you need to re@@ locate changes to these options with the function updates . )
&quot; only entries are displayed , the differences are indicated . if the target folder these files will not already be copied into the target folder . if the target folder these files are not already installed , they are lacking in a later program version . ) This option is de@@ activated in a later program version . ) This option is de@@ activated in pres@@ et@@ ting folder . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons to choose the source with the let@@ tering A , B and C below the menu bar . if you are attached to one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) , they will be back on the button again accordingly . &quot;
in the pres@@ et this option is disabled . Under@@ differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white signs .
the &amp; kp@@ ager ; shows a mini @-@ show of all virtual work@@ space . it is quite handy to see the ongoing programs on the work@@ space to change their size or move them . this works both within a desktop and several .
the &amp; kp@@ ager ; can display all virtual work@@ space as well as the applications running in it . the applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
the middle mouse button can be moved within &amp; kp@@ ager ; the movement can be moved within a desktop and other work@@ space as well .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked on : if on the empty background of &amp; kp@@ ager ; click on an application within &amp; kp@@ ager ; then click on an application within &amp; kp@@ ager ; then click on an application within &amp; kp@@ ager ; also click on an application within &amp; ring ; maxim@@ ize , on working space and end . the commands will make the following : &quot;
maxim@@ ize the use window on the full size of the desktop . appears only when applied to an application .
send the application to selected virtual work@@ space . appears only when applied to an application .
&quot; this device marked is marked , can be drag@@ ged inside the &amp; kp@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other work@@ places can be moved . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , will be displayed in &amp; ring ager ; the names of the virtual work@@ space displayed . &quot;
&quot; cross @-@ side of this field leaves the &amp; kp@@ ager ; the number of virtual work@@ places is displayed together with name , the names with Or@@ din@@ al@@ numbers are provided , &amp; eg ; 1. working surface . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the background of each work@@ space is also shown as background in &amp; kp@@ ager ; &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the current programs will be displayed as a small window in &amp; ring ager ; otherwise only the empty work@@ space displayed in order to make their choice . &quot;
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rec@@ t@@ angle with the propor@@ tions of the program window . symbol shows the window with its standard symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . remark : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
&quot; here the arrangement of the &amp; kp@@ ager ; -@@ main window will be determined : classic leaves &amp; kp@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n @-@ R@@ aster , which shows all virtual work@@ space in a horizontal row and ver@@ tically illustrated in a sen@@ k@@ right , which is very good for the representation on the desktop . &quot;
the &amp; kp@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini program in the Control bar . it has the advantage that it can be used in the size that can display windows as symbols or with their content . furthermore it runs outside the control bar .
right mouse button within &amp; kp@@ ager ; and subsequent output of switch @-@ setting up ... lets the dialog settings appear .
currently this cannot be changed in the dialog settings : you can do this but manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor like e.g. &amp; ke@@ dit ; or VI@@ . if you don &apos;t want to register as user root or login to your system administrator . in this file you must enter the key wind@@ ow@@ ac@@ ent@@ Mode and that a value indicated . possible values are :
&quot; because &amp; kp@@ ager ; part of the package base is , you need a functioning installation of the KDE labels . &quot;

&quot; &amp; km@@ ag ; is a screenshot of the screen . you can use &amp; km@@ ag ; a part of the screen , so as if you use a magni@@ fying glass for the small printed or the exact change of a picture . this documentation is intended to be a full manual for the use of &amp; km@@ ag . &quot;
&quot; -@@ km@@ ag ; is a very powerful application , which is constantly enhanced with new functions . it is optimized for use on high @-@ weak computers . &quot;
&quot; when you start &amp; km@@ ag , appears a window as shown above . the main window of &amp; km@@ ag ; shows the enlarged section of the screen . in the following , this window shows the larger area of the screen , is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as a selection window below . &quot;
in the default setting magni@@ fied &amp; km@@ ag ; alternatively you can arrange &amp; km@@ ag . alternatively you can arrange a selected screen mode in a larger window ( selection mode ) or the environment of the mouse cursor on the screen ( eg ; on the left side of the screen ) .
&quot; if you want to avoid that the mouse pointer in the enlarged window is displayed , select the setting of mouse cursor . please note that the form of mouse cursor is still not able to recognize the form of mouse cursor . this is always the standard @-@ k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse cursor . &quot;
&quot; in the selection mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it to the arrow and mouse @-@ keys and change its size . this can be done in the following ways : &quot;
move the mouse cursor in the larger window and keep the left mouse button pressed so you can move the content of the enlarge window and move it with the arrow keys .
&quot; if you additionally press the &amp; Shift , click or the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the selection window . &quot;
with this combination you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the selection window remains firm and only the lower right corner is to move .
&quot; &amp; km@@ ag ; features a lot of functions . you can copy the enlarged image directly to the printer , to copy in a file to the clip@@ board ( to add it later to other applications ) , the image is turning and much more . &quot;
start or stop the update of the display . the update will be updating the required CPU time against 0 .
&quot; select the actu@@ alization rate ( Very low , sc@@ oring , means , p@@ och , Very high ) . the higher the actu@@ alization rate , the more CPU time is needed . &quot;
in this mode a selection window appears . the selected range is displayed in a window .
&quot; &amp; km@@ ag ; uses your introductory shor@@ ts to save files , opening a new window , print , new@@ com@@ ers ( with the button document once again in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; ) , enlarge and reduced &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; landmark also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screenshot of the screen , so as if you use a magni@@ fier , in order to view the small printed in a newspaper or a photo . this application is suitable for various people of use : from research or artist to web designer or visual disabled . &quot;
detailed user &apos;s documentation can be found with help : / km@@ ag ( enter either this URL in the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or launch k@@ help@@ center help : / km@@ ag ) .

&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click , once the mouse @-@ cursor has had a while on the same spot . it is meant to help people who suffer the R@@ SI syndrome ( Rep@@ eti@@ tive disease syndrome ) and those of any mouse click pain . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click , once the mouse @-@ cursor has prepared a while on the same spot . it is thought to help people who em@@ ulate the Rep@@ eti@@ tian &apos;s In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and those of any mouse click pain . besides , it can em@@ ulate the draw with the mouse . this requires a little practice . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can the pain deal with the clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without any pain . unfortunately , you can also suffer from the mere damage to your computer , you should seek a doctor if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; to be able to make it clear : even if &amp; Mon@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; sor@@ eness helps to avoid the clicking with the mouse , it is against pain caused by eliminating the mouse , us@@ eless . and as with all ergonomic aids is valid : the result may vary for everyone . &quot;
the use of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and leads a mouse click here once you break the movement shortly .
&quot; if the smart re@@ loc@@ ator is activated , makes u@@ c@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break after it &apos;s pressing the mouse button . in this way you can carry out the mouse button . in this way you can carry out the mouse button with pressed mouse button . this is how you get rid of the mouse button , but you get used quickly to it . &quot;
&quot; this verse time must be hidden after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse @-@ click . &quot;
&quot; is intelligent to be switched on , the turning point is switched ( 1 / 10 s ) active . here the time is shut down , the &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after the descent of the mouse button wa@@ its before the mouse button again get rid , if the mouse button is switched again , if the mouse is switched off . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Mon@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now , this function is now activated by mouse button . if this function is activated , creates a long @-@ click on the left and back , followed by a break , a click with the right mouse button . a long @-@ click . these movements are started in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt , if &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time will be started , but they can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; if the sound is del@@ ayed , you can move &amp; k@@ de ; to keep the reaction times , select Sound &amp; Multimedia , select there sound system and here the rider General . there is a sli@@ der sound Pu@@ ffer that you can install on a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times . &quot;
&quot; this setting is marked , is called &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only available under &amp; k@@ de ; please check the respective documentation on rate to find out how you start a program automatically . &quot;
&quot; sets all settings back to values , which were set when opening the dialogue . have you already pushed the button , the settings on the stand after the final pressures of waste are reset . &quot;
&quot; best use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; initially using the pres@@ ets . especially the intelligent re@@ loc@@ ating should let you first be switched off . if you then click on the automatic mouse click , you can later take the intelligent move . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it may be necessary to reduce the response times from &amp; k@@ de ; at sounds . &quot;
&quot; first of all you should be aware of which places a mouse click without effect : the Click on the neutr@@ als components of windows or on places in the browser window that don &apos;t link to un@@ preced@@ ented reactions . you can therefore park the mouse on such places until you want to use them again . &quot;
&quot; when your mouse h@@ elt , you should clean@@ se your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick allows you to clean not just the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into touch with the mouse ball . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to take out the mouse ball . as that happens , is different from mouse to mouse . however , it should be quickly clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the ball roles . these are on the sides of the Lo@@ ches , into which the ball was used . the dirt and the dirt here you can easily drop with a flat blade or the barrel @-@ scrat@@ ching . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations , the operating system inter@@ rup@@ ts the execution of &amp; Mon@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you are just to use an ar@@ dem@@ ise tool , that means that &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the surgery does not end anymore through the release of the mouse . &quot;
this happens when you use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use a window window and move a window .
the solution to this problem is that you can carry out a mouse click . here is the status of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; return and you can work as usual .
&quot; problem : if you type text , try &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and sets the cursor to another position . &quot;
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cursor there , where you want to have it . however , you park your mouse on a neutral area of desktop , if you are looking out a ke@@ yst@@ er path . secure zones for mouse @-@ cursor are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the toolbar and menus and the titles of windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the intelligent feed , but I don &apos;t make it to edit text . &quot;
&quot; the intelligent re@@ loc@@ ating is an advanced function of &amp; Mon@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time , before you to copy it to the clip@@ board , to copy it into the clip@@ board , to move it into the clip@@ board , and you will probably want to set any other action . here are some ad@@ vices about it : &quot;
&quot; use the smart re@@ loc@@ ating not , if you just begin using &amp; Mon@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; do not mark the text box , then follow the mouse button pressed , while you move the mouse button to move to the other end of the text , and once again turn the mouse button . &quot;
&quot; use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this will be sure when &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button expresses a sound like a mouse @-@ click . so you know exactly when in the intelligent feed @-@ sliding period . later , you can use the intelligent re@@ loc@@ ating mouse even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . however , it requires some exercise . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; Mon@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to be able to use , the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window System must be installed . this should be the case in most system . &quot;
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound@@ card and speaker and set these correctly .
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; enter the mouse button once the mouse cursor is under@@ min@@ ed . this program was developed for people who suffer the R@@ SI syndrome and those of the activity of the Mo@@ sta@@ est pain@@ s . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; it can also be configured , that it is a certain time waiting that a draw process begins before the mouse button will start . in this way the mouse can also be performed with the mouse . &quot;

&quot; km@@ outh ; is a program , with the m@@ ute user can let their computer speak for themselves . &quot;
&quot; with the program &amp; km@@ outh , m@@ ute user can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the talk on propositions which should be discussed again . &quot;
&quot; on the first page of the wiz@@ ard ( lin@@ kes screenshot ) enter the command a , which will later be used for voice output of text . further details can be found in the description of the tool dial@@ ogs . &quot;
&quot; on the second page you can choose the standard text@@ book . from the text@@ book books you can often choose text passages , without having to tap into . the texture can of course be edited . &quot;
&quot; on the third page ( right screenshot ) , you define the dictionary for the vocabulary . &amp; km@@ outh ; reads the KDE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of individual words . in addition , you can indicate the wording of a Open@@ Office.@@ org @-@ dictionary , so that only correctly the words used in the vocabulary . &quot;
the main window of &amp; km@@ outh ; is clearly visible and contains essentially an entry field for the ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ oting of your propositions ( the lower white area in the screenshot ) and a de@@ bit memory of the already sung phrases ( the upper white field in the screenshot ) .
&quot; if you have km@@ outh ; correctly , you can enter in the input field the propositions you want to hear . each spoken set is attached to the running memory . you can choose from these propositions which should be discussed again . &quot;
&quot; with the menu entry settings km@@ outh ; set up the setup dialog by &amp; km@@ outh ; this dialog contains two box @-@ cards , voice @-@ tone and settings , the page &apos;s vocabulary , as well as the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . &quot;
&quot; in the input box of the box card voice , enter the command to call the voice @-@ generator . in the range under the entry field you set the character en@@ coding with the text to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; and km@@ outh ; knows two kinds to pass the text . select the link field , if the text is to be passed as standard to language generator . &quot;
&quot; if the an@@ kreu@@ z field is not selected , the text is passed as parameter . you can use the following card holder : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command to voice output depends on your voice generator . this command can be found in the documentation on your language generator . examples of this can be found in the App@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; as a language service is used as a language service , it is first attempt to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if that is successful , the other settings are available on this page . the product range is available for voice @-@ voice and which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection action to determine the selection of a text box , you determine which action through the short@@ cuts or by selecting a word cycle in the menu text@@ book or in the box for text pass@@ codes are triggered . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of so@@ fort , the selected text@@ cycle is directly spoken and additionally inserted in the box memory . with the selection of In the input field , the selected texts will initially only be entered into the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second selection box of the machining window , you can specify if the text@@ book can be automatically saved when closing the machining window will be automatically saved . &quot;
&quot; the book is stored with the selection of text@@ book . if you choose changes , the text@@ book is not saved . select before saving , will be &amp; km@@ outh ; ask if the text@@ book will be saved . &quot;
the page &apos;s vocabulary contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the vocabulary . in the main window next to the entry field shows &amp; km@@ outh ; a selection box when this list contains more than a dictionary . with this selection you can choose the currently used dictionary for vocabulary .
&quot; with buttons right on the page you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries , or add it to a file . below the list you can set in the input field and set the language for the dictionary . &quot;
choose for this source the desired language ; &amp; km@@ outh ; reads the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation one . the frequency of the individual words will be determined simply by counting the occurrence . additionally you can add the word list with a Open@@ Office.@@ org @-@ dictionary to insert only proper written words into the new dictionary .
&quot; with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; km@@ outh ; asks , which words should be merged , and how these weigh@@ ted are to be brought . &quot;
&quot; with this option , you place a new , empty dictionary without entries . since &amp; km@@ outh ; new entered words automatically into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time . &quot;
the main area of the window for the processing of text moun@@ ts is two divided . in the upper part the texture books are shown as tree structure .
&quot; in the lower part , you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text box , you can change the word cycle or the related short@@ cut . if you have selected a text text@@ book , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; to add actions like new text passages or books or delete selected text passages and books , you can either reach the menu item , in the toolbar or via an elevator menu . &quot;
the sequence of text@@ books or text passages you can change by drag@@ ging with the mouse to the new job or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; button .
&quot; the selected text is copied and copied into the clip@@ board . if in the input field a text section is selected , this is used , otherwise the selected areas of the transfer . &quot;
&quot; the selected text is copied into the clip@@ board . if in the input field a text section is selected , this is used , otherwise the selected areas of the transfer . &quot;
&quot; the currently active proposition is discussed . if text is located in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected propositions of the run @-@ storage . &quot;
&quot; this menu entry is crossed , will display a sliding toolbar with buttons for frequently used commands . the toolbar can be placed directly under the menu bar . by mouse click on the ver@@ sive left side and hand , the toolbar can be moved to another place . &quot;
&quot; this menu entry is crossed , is a narrow l@@ ull in the lower part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; km@@ outh ; displayed when not b@@ crossed , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; this menu entry is crossed , will be displayed a shift bar for texture books . by mouse click on the toolbar window directly under the toolbar panel and drag@@ ging the toolbar can be moved to another place . &quot;
probably you have given the command for voice output not correct or not complete . open Settings km@@ outh ; setup the page General settings and enter the command for voice output on the map &apos;s voice output . ( see Set@@ ting dialog for voice syn@@ thesizer for more details . )
&quot; Festival is a voice @-@ issue system from the University of Edinburgh . currently , English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh is currently supported . the license allows to use festival free of charge and without restrictions . &quot;
to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output will be assumed that festival is installed in the folder / usr / local / festival . the command to voice output is then :
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is an in &amp; Java . currently , he only supports the English language . currently , he only supports the English pron@@ unci@@ ation language . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and without restrictions . &quot;
to show an example of the command line for setting up voice output will be accepted that Free@@ T@@ TS installed in the folder / usr / local / fre@@ et is then possible with one of the three command examples :
&quot; for the third example , the option must send data as standard entry . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
&quot; M@@ BRO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . he conver@@ ts a list of ph@@ one@@ ers into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to use the text in Ph@@ on@@ eme . the license allows to use the M@@ BRO@@ LA for free for non commercial and non @-@ military applications . &quot;
in our example H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text in Ph@@ on@@ eme for M@@ BRO@@ LA under the assumption that H@@ adi@@ fax and M@@ BRO@@ LA in / usr / local / ha@@ di@@ fax and / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la installed .
&quot; unfortunately H@@ adi@@ fax likes to swal@@ lowed H@@ adi@@ fax just like the last sign of the text , so that an additional sign is required . the full command is therefore more costly than in the other examples : &quot;
( cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / ha@@ di@@ fax / mb@@ ro@@ la / mb@@ ro@@ la / dev / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; art@@ spl@@ ay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in a line . the option will send data as default .
&quot; the voice @-@ issue dem@@ on by &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language service , all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ uses a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being further developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice @-@ acting systems . &quot;
&quot; since the adjustment of language generators is only at the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use as a language service as a language service in &amp; km@@ outh . &quot;
&quot; to setting , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which is in the setup dialog of &amp; km@@ outh ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; km@@ outh ; successfully use a language generator ( and natural &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; km@@ outh ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additionally storage for voice generator ) , but that depends on the individual of your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; km@@ outh ; is an application with which people who cannot speak , text by the machine can be saved . it will be saved a list already sung phrases , which the user can always re@@ por@@ tioned again . &quot;
note that &amp; km@@ outh ; no voice @-@ syn@@ thesizer involves . on the computer a language syn@@ thesizer must be installed .

&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; - The voice @-@ issue system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is one of modules of existing service , which allows every application to read text over the &amp; D@@ Bus ; interface . &quot;
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a sub@@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice @-@ tone ( T@@ TS ) . it represents a common use interface for &amp; k@@ de ; programmer ready to be equipped with which their applications can be equipped with T@@ TS abilities . also the users offers it interesting options .
read texts ( or parts of it ) in the text editor &amp; Kate ; even if &amp; Kate ; in other &amp; k@@ de ; applications is embedded .
&quot; the language edition is done via the program Speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher , the different background programme such as es@@ ale , festival , &amp; etc . &quot;
allows the production of voice output on the command line ( or with shell script ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; -@@ Help program .

&quot; at the first start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr or as long as no sp@@ okes@@ man are shown , the box card is shown . see also . if you have at least one speaker , the cart@@ on card is displayed . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS @-@ syn@@ thesizer offer different languages and voices , so also various male or female , or such which is defined in volume or speed . you should also set up multiple variants for a syn@@ thesizer . you should at least use a sp@@ okes@@ person before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; use the program speed @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise the default speakers . &quot;
different speaker for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable with several printers in the same printer .
&quot; click on the box @-@ board speaker at kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr , the cart@@ ons is displayed automatically if you run kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and still no speaker is set up . &quot;
all furnished speakers appear in this list . the preferred speaker appear above in the list . the top speaker is used for voice output if an application does not exist .
&quot; select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to move the speaker in the list a line further down . the order of the speaker in the list also determines its priority . &quot;
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; power system ;
&quot; here , choose a voting type , there are three male and three female voices and a junior and p@@ est tim@@ ers to choose from . &quot;
&quot; click here , appears on the new speaker at the box card speaker . to change the settings of this Interphone , click Edit . &quot;
&quot; now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; already for almost use . go back to box card , so that the T@@ TS service is activated ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , so that the T@@ TS @-@ Service starts . now , click on map to create text to create and manage text . see map . &quot;
&quot; if you have at least one speaker , you can start the language output system of &amp; k@@ de ; click on the box name and to open this map card . here you can set some general options . &quot;
&quot; select this cross @-@ section to activate the &amp; kt@@ ts ; this start successfully starts the cart@@ on card orders and you can read text orders and read , see . remove the mark@@ ings , is hal@@ ted K@@ TT@@ SD and the T@@ TS @-@ System of &amp; k@@ de ; disabled . &quot;
&quot; if kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is finished , runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; further , provided the field language output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is crossed . &quot;
&quot; this an@@ kreu@@ z field marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr appears in the pre @-@ read automatically in the system scope of the control bar , it dis@@ appears as soon as the pre @-@ read is completed . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series you can start text entries , break , stop and resume . &quot;
with the buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; inter@@ clip@@ board or open a text file to read . you can also change the speaker for a job .
&quot; click on An@@ gle or OK , then all changed settings on all pages . &quot;
the card @-@ card orders is only displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD was started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD click on the box board and activate there voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
&quot; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of displayed web page . check out whether &amp; kt@@ ts ; then select the text that should be read , and select in the main menu tools text . after a short time the voice output should begin . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s almost always useful to mark the desired text of a website . you can also ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; -@@ pre @-@ head@@ lines and other invisible brands are also read . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Kate ; the enhanced text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; you can read , check whether &amp; kt@@ ts ; then , select the text that should be read , and select in the main menu tools text pre @-@ read , then the voice output should begin . &quot;
&quot; this also works when &amp; Kate ; in other applications is embedded , as &amp; eg ; in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; qu@@ anta ; &quot;
&quot; K@@ Noti@@ fy is the Message system of &amp; k@@ de ; you will be notified about you by you , you can also read the text of these messages as well . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; conversation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; you can set different types of messages . you can set up different kinds of messages ; for example , you set up a message when you appear in a IR@@ C channel in which your nickname occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can then read the IR@@ C news text . &quot;
&quot; supports a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program K@@ Noti@@ fy , appears a menu entry noti@@ fications in the menu settings of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ depending on application . &quot;
filter for drawing dimensions offer a good chance to correct notice : false stressed or fails to correct the file . you remove the tags and b from the messages that can be sent by mail and also the expression / local / In@@ box as it can be accepted in most cases as required .
filters are one of the advanced abilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filter is not required .
&quot; in filters , text is edited , before he will be sent to the program Speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for enhancing the pron@@ unci@@ ation to replace wrong words or abbrevi@@ ations , to choose a suitable language and speaker , or to handle certain defects of voice @-@ syn@@ thesi@@ ologists and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the working method of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; different types of texts . &quot;
the edition of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it will be pre@@ ached all other contracts and keeps these orders . when the output of the screen reader is read , the following orders are continued again . &quot;
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor gets too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are continued after the issu@@ ance of warning .
&quot; messages have the nearest top priority . a message ends up a message . while you can read a long text on a website , you can welcome you with &amp; km@@ outh ; someone welcome the room here . &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications are also messages . read this . &quot;
&quot; the rest are simple text entries . each order you encounter from the box card , is a word order . K@@ S@@ ay@@ it is an example of a applications which are used for a applications . text y@@ ields are intended for the issu@@ ing texts which have no particular ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; all four orders are processed in queue , with the exception of the output of screen re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a screen re@@ aders , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just such reads , this issue will be hal@@ ted and ended . &quot;
&quot; first , you must know that filter will never be applied to the output of screen playback . you will be applied to normal war@@ nings , messages and text entries as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages . &quot;
filter uses the text and enter it to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are executed as modules . in the future there are still further types of filters .
&quot; strings , they replace parts of a text by other text . the re@@ plac@@ eable parts can be used either as words or as a regular expression ; it is used with pre@@ defined character controllers as : - ) by text or for the form@@ atting of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better compreh@@ en@@ sible form . &quot;
&amp; XML ; -@@ trans@@ former use a X@@ SLT @-@ file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format to convert into another format . delivery of &amp; X@@ HTML ; are included in SS@@ ML .
&quot; with speaker filter you can filter orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program , the text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent to a speaker . if you can read for example on the box card speaker , you can read text from KDE messages about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these different filters has adjustable rules , according to which he is applied for voice output . if the filter does not determine that his rules exist , he gives the text unchanged to the next filter . &quot;
&quot; when a word assignment , a notification , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications on &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it is set up by all activated filters , which are set down on the page down . the process is processed in order in the list from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of the furnished normal filters . if a filter is not crossed , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed down from top to bottom . &quot;
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter and it will be shown below the following furniture panel .
&quot; for setting of string filters , you need to enter a list of words or regular expression as compar@@ ative patterns , then the text will be changed in the text , then the text will be exchanged for the corresponding replacement text . large and low @-@ p@@ umping is not noticed when compared . &quot;
&quot; type for your filter a name . this name can be used as required , it must only be different from the names of the other filters . &quot;
this is the list of words and regular phrases . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column and re@@ places it in accordance with the strings from the column . the list is shown in the sequence from top to bottom .
click here to move the marked word or the regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons , you can download a list of words or regular excer@@ pts from a file that save the current list or delete a list from a file , the file will be attached to the existing list . &quot;
&quot; here , a language is entered here , the filter is only used when the speaker speaks for the text@@ book one of the languages listed here . click on the button to display a list of languages . you can also click on the button to hold a list of languages at the mouse click the &amp; C@@ trl ; button pressed . &quot;
&quot; here is a value entered , the filter is only applied if the text is used by one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comp@@ mat@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
&quot; the applications ID run programs can be obtained with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ Num@@ bers must be taken away . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 indicates , you can only enter copied . &quot;
the string filter is applied only then to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the box of th@@ eses Filter if match . all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts . &quot;
in comparison of words the character filter is used in the form \ \ s word \ \ s. words must therefore be limited by separ@@ ating ( spaces ) .
in this hand@@ book you will find no guidance for writing regular expression . if you have the &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; tit@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Con@@ figuration &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; phrases can be found in the package k@@ deu@@ ter@@ ls .
&amp; XML ; -@@ trans@@ former translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SLT @-@ files from a format to another format . X@@ SLT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3C standard for such surveys . it can only be used on well @-@ formed XML . the auxiliary program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c achiev@@ able via the environmental variable PAT@@ H ranges also x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; with the microphone elect@@ oral filter you can send texts to a certain speaker , who can be arranged on the map card speaker , or to a speaker with certain properties . you can , for example set that texts by k@@ mail from a female voice should be read . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; kt@@ ts ; add a text to the filter , there is a sp@@ okes@@ person for the text . the speaker is selected by the sp@@ okes@@ person who selected the program , and select the properties of the cart@@ on card speaker . with the speaker filter , you can over@@ write the selected sp@@ okes@@ person . &quot;
&quot; if the filter is applied here , the filter is applied , if the text is installed the specified regular expression . is installed on your system of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; tit@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; phrases , you can get this by clicking on the button to get help with the entry . &quot;
&quot; to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , begin the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; here the characteristics of the desired filter conditions are fixed . if the text is selected above the filter conditions , the speaker will be selected by the desired requirement . click on the button on the right to view the dialog box . &quot;
use these buttons to save your microphone settings or to delete all settings .
the inter@@ changeable filter is used only then to apply to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box of th@@ eses . you must register at least one condition .

the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; -@@ conversion filter is however not mandatory . Debian users can x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; to compile &amp; kt@@ ts , you need a current development environment of KDE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including the packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
&quot; if you have downloaded the source text of &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source archive for k@@ de@@ hies , or have downloaded the tar@@ ball any one night and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you use &amp; kt@@ ts , check first whether speech disp@@ at@@ cher works correctly with your language syn@@ thesizer . for this , you can use the shell script @-@ conf @-@ conf . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr is designed to be further developed , that the establishment of speech disp@@ at@@ cher is directly possible and the script SPD @-@ conf will no longer need it . &quot;
&quot; a long text is distor@@ ted in individual sent@@ ences . the user can go back , repeat , repeat the output or cancel it . &quot;
&quot; if an application is text on &amp; kt@@ ts , it is possible to request the properties of the preferred speaker for the output . thus , an application can be chosen , whose language English and its gender feminine is , it is automatically the most suitable speaker . if you choose more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a sp@@ okes@@ person will see you in . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the box card to add or edit a sp@@ okes@@ person to the list or click Edit , the cart@@ oons for Festival Interactive is shown . as an example , the module of the module for Festival Interactive is shown . details on the modules can be found under . &quot;
enter the path to the detailed f@@ estiv@@ al@@ program . if the path to festival is included in PAT@@ H you have to enter only festival .
&quot; select the character coding for text that is handed over to Festival . in general , this setting is automatically made . generally speaking that Western languages ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 use , eastern languages such as Czech or s@@ lowak@@ i use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these sli@@ ders , you place volume , Interphone speed and pitch of synthetic language . if you can not select some regul@@ ator and this gray will not be displayed , the voice of your chosen voice can not be displayed . &quot;
&quot; some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n @-@ voices need to be loaded around several seconds due to their size . if you load this hint , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that ( with maximum memory consumption ) the first sentence is faster syn@@ thesi@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; if this an@@ kreu@@ z cannot be selected , you still have no speaker set up ( or forget to contact ) . &quot;
&quot; is this an@@ kreu@@ z field marked , is displayed when the launch of t@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is displayed in the system section . otherwise , after the start only the symbol kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is visible , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to view the program window . &quot;
&quot; if this tie @-@ field is marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr still does not run , it appears in the system range as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD will read a text . this means you have the option to read it or to control it . &quot;
&quot; here are all orders placed in queue , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of propositions and the straight one set . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the map card . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this row , you can select the order in the order that is selected in the list below , pre@@ - or back . ( but not every job consists of several sets ) . &quot;
&quot; with a click on OK , all changes of the settings ( also available on the other map maps ) and rec@@ t@@ sm@@ gr becomes a symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if the sound@@ system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the map card audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; here are only text orders performed and managed . expenditure of screen re@@ actors , war@@ nings and messages are not displayed . additional information about the message types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in . &quot;
&quot; choose the type of audio output . if a component can not be selected , it has been compiled , either without support for the respective Audi@@ om@@ o@@ dul or &amp; kt@@ ts ; the necessary libraries can not load . &quot;
&quot; when G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ co@@ ders will be used for audio output , select here the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you need to install at least one module . have AL@@ SA selected , select the PC@@ M device . &quot;
Set the microphone speed here . 50@@ th % corresponds roughly half of half and 200@@ 0s . so that these settings can be implemented in order to install the program so@@ x .
click on An@@ gle to take the new settings for the current &amp; resolution ; -@@ System to take over .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are furnished in your system . most of them will not work . you need to find yourself which device works with you . in doubt choose standard .
&quot; on this map card , you can set special promotions that will always be run when the text is interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of language contracts : &quot;
the edition of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it will be pre@@ ached to all other contracts and keeps these orders . after the output of the screen reader has been read , the raised orders will be resum@@ ed . &quot;
war@@ nings have the nearest priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is too hot . a warning holds the output of messages and normal text . these orders are continued after reading the warning .
&quot; messages have the next priority . a message breaks regular text . &amp; km@@ outh ; is an example of an application to read the news . if you have a long text on a website , you can read with &amp; km@@ outh ; nevertheless someone welcome that straight to the room . &quot;
&quot; a text is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen re@@ aders , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio edition in the queue . &quot;
&quot; this audio file is always played , if a normal text is interrupted . if both introductory sound and introductory news is active , the introductory sound is played before the introductory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this cart@@ oons are valid only for normal text entries . for messages , war@@ nings and expenditure of screen re@@ actors , there are no special actions if they have been interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &quot;
&quot; to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; K@@ Noti@@ fy &apos;s news , run kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and click noti@@ fications . the card @-@ card al@@ erts appear . &quot;
&quot; select this option to switch the pre@@ read of &amp; k@@ de ; proj@@ ections , this setting is not marked , the other settings are de@@ activated and &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads any noti@@ fications before . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is marked , al@@ erts when a sound is played by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add events to the list or delete it . if you click on the button Add , you will find the application and the event you want to add to the list . &quot;
&quot; this event reads the message before , the &amp; conversation ; sent , if anyone mentioned in an IR@@ C message your nickname . &quot;
&quot; all events , for which in the list is nothing other stated , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored . &quot;
&quot; use this selection , to set out what &amp; kt@@ ts shall do when an event occurs . you have the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you choose a user text , enter the text you want . you can use the following card holder : &quot;
&quot; you can enter the characteristics of the desired speaker . standard select the speaker , which is shown in the list on map @-@ card speaker as the top entry . see also for this . &quot;
&quot; note that there are three levels for events . is defined for a specific event of a particular application , it will be executed . otherwise , the action for all other events of the particular application will be executed . as last option comes the action for coll@@ agen , which is defined under standard ( all other events ) . &quot;

use the button save to save the settings for noti@@ fications in a file . use the button loading to load stored settings from a file . if you want to start using an empty list , click Delete . all entries except all off@@ s will be deleted . &quot;
&quot; speech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3C standard to mark text for voice output , the speaker speed , the speaker , the voice of voice and the pitch . moreover , brands for controlling the pron@@ unci@@ ation of the example abbrevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3C standard . &quot;
currently supported &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partly and only in basic functions . the following constraints are available :
&quot; you need to install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tish male ) , as this is the default voice , the festival used by the SS@@ ML issue . &quot;
&quot; if the settings for speed or pitch in the Festival configuration dialog is not set on 100@@ 85 % , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ ot@@ on . &quot;
&lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; en@@ coding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &lt; !

there are two types of filters - normal filters and typ@@ ing limit@@ ing filter ( SD@@ B @-@ Filter ) . S@@ B@@ Ds underlined texts written in individual sent@@ ences . thus the first set of syn@@ thesi@@ zed needs to be pre @-@ jumping or ab@@ rupt or cancel or ab@@ rupt , even if the language syn@@ thesizer is not directly supported . &quot;
here you can see the S@@ atz@@ der@@ limit@@ er filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is automatically set up as an allocation of a stat@@ limit@@ less recogni@@ zable filter . you can change its settings or add more typ@@ ing limit@@ ing filters , but it will be rec@@ tified . &quot;
&quot; easiest to learn the setup of the talk sel@@ ections by clicking on the box card , what speaker &amp; kt@@ ts ; select the speaker selection again , change some features and consider how the selection of inter@@ phone have changed . therefore , you need to have more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is un@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; then faster with the reading can begin , since only the first set must be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long . &quot;
&quot; you can then keep up text entries on cart@@ on card , even if the voice @-@ syn@@ thesizer is not supported this function . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons the normal S@@ atz@@ der@@ limit@@ er filter is automatically set up , if you run kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr for the first time . he can not be switched off , unless you know what you do . &quot;
stat@@ utes recogni@@ zes text with a regular expression for stat@@ utes and add a tab@@ ular code ( dec@@ im@@ al@@ code 8 ) at the stat@@ ure bar ( dec@@ imal table 8 ) at the sole limits ( dec@@ imal boxes are automatically removed from the text ) . note that the default @-@ level limit@@ ing filter is included .
&quot; S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News ( none ) , war@@ nings , messages or the output of screen re@@ actors . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed from Ver@@ ones the normal S@@ atz@@ der@@ limit@@ er filter , you can insert it again by load the file standard _ sb@@ dr@@ c file . &quot;
on the map card reader you can over@@ write the microphone settings for the application . the card @-@ card is displayed when
use of the standard speaker ( the top on the map card speaker ) . in other words : there will be no microphone properties .
&quot; use of the appropriate speaker , which indicates all the properties of a single speaker . if you choose the settings of the microphone or edit , choose &amp; kt@@ ts ; this speaker choose from . otherwise , &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker , which the most viewed originally introduced properties . &quot;
select the method to enter the desired microphone properties by clicking on one of the buttons .
&quot; here , select the properties of the desired speaker . if this feature doesn &apos;t matter , give you nothing . &quot;
select this junction box when the property should prevail over other properties . you can also place several mark@@ ings here .
&quot; since the language is a critical factor when standing the issue is , it is always used as a priority property . the only case when you possibly want to specify the attri@@ bute language , especially if you know that any particular application text is sent in another language than that in the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to use all properties in the field of speaker , the most suitable matches , click on the button standard , and then use to sp@@ okes@@ person who corresponds to the following . &quot;
in this case 0 for the last word order in queue . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number is the input 0 required ) .
&quot; kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr cr@@ ashes immediately when it is started . I have compiled de@@ bug support , but I do not get back tracking . &quot;
G@@ Stre@@ amer is un@@ shortened and &amp; kt@@ ts ; probably you must register G@@ Stre@@ amer . if the problem is not resolved is possibly a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try to upgrade or un@@ install G@@ Stre@@ amer .
&quot; the audio @-@ edition of AL@@ SA does not work when I am playing music with another application , free@@ zes &amp; kt@@ ts ; a message appears on the &amp; Con@@ sole ; appears a message that goes to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; on your system , the problem is that conflicts can occur at AL@@ SA that prohi@@ bit the simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . references to possible solutions can be found on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org . &quot;
I downloaded an additional voice for festival from the internet . I have installed it and can use it in festival but kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr does not show this voice .
&quot; insert in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / f@@ estiv@@ al@@ int / Vo@@ ices the new voice . when that &apos;s successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; where you have found the voice to the developers . &quot;
&quot; on the map card audio there is a setting speed . so this works , the program has to be installed so@@ x and through the ambient variable PAT@@ H . some syn@@ thesi@@ zers like Festival Interactive offer itself on map card for intercom devices . depending on the chosen voice this is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the microphone speed are ignored if &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML , has its own tags , with which the speed is controlled . ) de@@ activate either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; according to &amp; XML ; ( see ) , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of &amp; HTML ; -@@ to @-@ SS@@ ML Re@@ form@@ er@@ filter , and set the microphone speed . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t make it read that Web sites are pre@@ viewed with a female voice . I have set up a female Festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the web pages with a male voice . &quot;
at the Festival 1.@@ 95 beta appears the day SA@@ BLE GEN@@ DER not to work . this festival does not re@@ jects the X@@ SL file for converting SS@@ ML to S@@ aber the GEN@@ DER @-@ tags . the same applies to the VO@@ ICE tags .
&quot; I have added a separate string filter and now I can proceed in &amp; kt@@ ts ; not anymore , or go back . on the box , the order will be displayed only out of one sentence . what am I doing wrong ? &quot;
&quot; pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks ( point , question mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) are not allowed to filter . use for this character instead a filter for the beam . &quot;
AL@@ SA ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . AL@@ SA is already installed on most systems with &amp; Linux ; ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org )

&quot; some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts in the audio issue . if your system also counts , you can not keep playing music and read a text before you find a word order and then start another . possible solutions for this problem you will find on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) . &quot;
&quot; with Stand July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ en has not yet supported real breaks . if you keep a word order in &amp; kt@@ ts ; the current set is still read yet . &quot;

&quot; have downloaded &amp; kt@@ ts ; as tar@@ ball ( with t@@ ar ge@@ sted archive ) , sign up as a normal user and un@@ pack the tar@@ ball in a matching folder . change in this folder and enter the following commands : &quot;
in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 the module &amp; arts ; probably removed or at least only provided upon request .
the following modules for voice @-@ syn@@ thesizer are created by default . some of them have a run@@ time depen@@ dency of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the guidelines of the Debian distribution ) . ( non @-@ free according to the guidelines of the Debian distribution ) .
as a pres@@ et &amp; kt@@ ts ; in / opt / K@@ DE@@ 3 installed . this folder is not listed in the ambient variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you must specify as option --@@ pre@@ fix = destination . for example

&quot; before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; use first , check whether your language syn@@ thesizer properly works . follow the instructions that you have received with syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
&quot; Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer , whose source code is manifest@@ ed . the quality of the votes is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . with many voices you can set loud@@ ness , Interphone speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ . &quot;
&quot; you need to install at least one language . help in the instructions provided with the festival , you need to pre @-@ read web pages , you need to install the ( male British ) voice of Rab _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for these voices , you need to compile an additional module , therefore you need the source code of festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on the transfer . &quot;
&quot; this voice requires Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or higher pre@@ di@@ ct . the voice is still in an early development stage . un@@ pack the software in festival / lib / Vo@@ ices / Russian / . if you enter Russian voices , you must enter a Cyr@@ illi@@ an ( 8 @-@ bit ) coding such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
the festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; look for festival as first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the En@@ coding must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the Option must be set to a 8 @-@ bit Cyr@@ illi@@ c as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
the Festival can be used together with the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; syn@@ thesizer . then the Festival uses the l@@ ex@@ ik@@ al analysis and &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; this creates the audio edition . the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ voices can be downloaded by
note that &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; no complete language output system is . &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; generated language from Di@@ ph@@ on files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone .

&quot; with this procedure additional W@@ rap@@ per @-@ code is added to festival , to use &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; votes for voice @-@ synthesis ; -@@ voice files are not installed in the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; folder , but in the folder Festival / lib / . instructions can be found at &quot;
I@@ MS German festival is a changing version of festival for German &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; voices . required either Festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install Festival and &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; then download MS German Festival of

the instruction module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ts ; with any language syn@@ thesizer according to any language syn@@ thesizer according to the command line .
&quot; at the best use a command to write the language output in a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) , instead of writing the output directly to the Audi@@ og@@ ram . &quot;
&quot; this hand@@ book explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; contro@@ l@@ center ; that allows the management of network interfaces , rout@@ ing and DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; c@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; &quot;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package has been designed to enable users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; create the areas of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the following tasks :
after installation a new module network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting c@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in the &amp; k@@ menu ;
&quot; it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware does not install . physical devices and their drivers have to already be installed and configured , so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device is shown at all and allows the adjustment of network properties . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , drivers for the network hardware and other devices are installed while installing &amp; Linux ; network devices are added later , the drivers have to be loaded by adapting to the following files , according to the kernel release : &quot;
the module Network settings will be loaded when the option network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; index selected . in the start@@ up of the module settings it is temp@@ ting to detect the platform automatically on the system .
&quot; if the platform can not be recognized , the fre@@ eware selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which the distribution and the re@@ vit@@ re@@ tired is best . thanks to Mark@@ ing the setting non @-@ recur@@ ring requests , the setting can be permanently hit . when the next start of the network settings will then be eff@@ ected automatically . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is possible only in the system administration mode . previously , all options are grey , which means the settings can only be viewed , the change mode is not possible . in the system administration mode , you can get by clicking the button of system administration mode at the right bottom of the module . it is the input of the password . &quot;
in the system administration mode the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three hor@@ semen :
the tab network interface serves to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from the tab network interfaces the following tasks can be performed :
the settings sh@@ ear@@ ed network interface can set up through a selection of the desired device in the list and click the button to set up the button in the dialog box .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the button below shows the dialog with further possibilities . &quot;
&quot; with the selection automatic , the TCP / IP settings are done by a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . the DH@@ CP@@ - or BO@@ O@@ TP server is sending all necessary TCP / IP information with each system start , therefore no further setting is required . in the selection list , either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system . &quot;
with the selection Manual can be done without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP the TCP / IP address . in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified in the input field .
&quot; this setting is marked , initi@@ alizing the system the network interface at the boats . if the initi@@ alisation does not wish , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values given in this dialog are shown as properties of the device in the device &apos;s device .
it should be assured that the IP address is not already used in the network . entering an existing IP address would not be used to an TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; con@@ sole ; you can notice whether the desired address is already in use . in doubt the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or cut off on your computer . switch off of a off @-@ off network device is activated by selecting from the list and click on interface ....
network devices can be activated or modified according to your needs . dis@@ connecting a activated network device by selecting from the list and click to disable the interface ....
places the IP address of the computer in the local sub @-@ network that provides the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for the TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub @-@ systems .
&quot; if on the computer there is more than a network interface , the interface has to be selected on the net , in which the gateway computer is selected . &quot;
a computer with DNS support re@@ places a complete domain name due to the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computer can only address IP addresses . if the machine is http : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org we dis@@ solve the name to a IP address such as 12@@ 3.4 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
&quot; the machine to nam@@ ing part of the horse name solution enables simple administration of this list . entries can be added , removed or modified . DNS entries can be ordered by selecting an entry and adding or down@@ grade in the list with buttons , or be ordered in the priority . &quot;
by clicking the button Add ... from the group computer to nam@@ ing a DNS server can be added to a DNS server . it will add the dialogue of New Nam@@ eser@@ ver .
&quot; first , you have to enter the DNS server address and then click the button Add . the entry will then be inserted in the list . &quot;
&quot; from the group computer to the name resolution , select an entry and then click the button Edit ... It will display the dialog editing . &quot;
the list named above @-@ known calcul@@ ators describes links for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily by boats when no DNS server is available . in small , closed networks it can replace DNS server . &quot;
&quot; usually , the list feature known calcul@@ ators some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses are supported . this still in the test version of IP should replace it in the future version 4 . &quot;
enter the IP address of the known calculator and click Add .... The dialogue of the New Ali@@ as will be displayed .
&quot; enter the name of the known calculator and click the Add button . if the well @-@ known calcul@@ ators has several alias names , the button Add several times and enter the other alias names . &quot;
select an entry of a name @-@ known calculator from the list and select Edit ... The dialog documents is displayed .
&quot; it can be executed one of the following tasks , then by clicking OK , the list of static hosts will be updated . &quot;
&quot; the settings made in the module settings are not immediately in the system . to enable changes , needs to be set in a &amp; con@@ sole ; the following command must be set . &quot;
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is http : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ s@@ ource@@ for@@ ge@@ .net which allows you to download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of binary distribu@@ tions ( usually rpm packages ) ranges if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the ready compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and in a &amp; con@@ sole ; with rpm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a tool can be used with graphic user like k@@ package or the installation tool of its distribution . &quot;
&quot; in this case the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; not , but additionally the development packages are needed with libraries and other things . &quot;
&quot; this is recommended only experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do this . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information on basic networks technology , in the second are discussed all by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; changed configuration files . &quot;
this area can not replace an additional knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information on the integration of the PC is provided in a small ( hom@@ e- ) network .
&quot; currently , IP networks with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) is operated . IP@@ v@@ 6 has never expected great spread . from IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected that it is focused in the near future . this description is therefore focused on the common IP@@ v@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; one of the most important information is to point out what IP @-@ address of a network interface is to point . in foreign networks , at the &amp; eg ; Work@@ place is the network administrator to address a valid IP address or , if available , DH@@ CP can not be chosen as easily ! &quot;
&quot; when setting up your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be chosen for this purpose reserved to avoid IP address fli@@ ct with the global ( internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not re@@ directed to the Internet , therefore their use is possible . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the internet for such machines can be made by setting a gat@@ ew@@ ays . &quot;
for smaller networks are mostly used addresses in the area of 192.@@ 168.@@ 1.1 up to 192.@@ 168.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the area is large for networks up to 250 computers large enough .
&quot; in addition , the m@@ net@@ mask is usually set on 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all machines are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.@@ 0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the lo@@ op@@ back @-@ address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own computer ) . the default route is needed for the IP res@@ eller . &quot;
the net@@ address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine . usually the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 of an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface is associated like a closed circle .
&quot; in this part , the configuration files are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; and where they are stored in the various distribu@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; this file will sometimes be modified at DSL connections , so that it doesn &apos;t be surprised if in case of active DSL connections to other content than specified there . &quot;
for &amp; S@@ USE ; is known that this file will be sorted through scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand as expected can therefore occur .

&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; it provides a backup program for belt drives on the basis of t@@ ar . it offers the possibility to create several archives on a tape . the second goal was to answer a surface for t@@ ar , which has presented my wife : how much longer does it take , if you sec@@ ures ? &quot;
&quot; before a band can be used , it must be made by &amp; pe@@ date ; this can happen in three ways : &quot;
&quot; &amp; sund@@ own ; sp@@ ult the band back and reads the cl@@ amping information of the belt . recognis@@ es &amp; cold , the ch@@ aff@@ le on the tape , you will be asked if the tape should be form@@ atted . &quot;
&quot; det@@ ects &amp; pri@@ dat ; the pre @-@ sp@@ ann , looking for the right index on your record . cannot be found , you will be asked if the band@@ index should be re@@ created . &quot;
&quot; if everything went smoothly , it changes the symbol for the band@@ drive to indicate that the band is involved . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the content of the belt can now be sear@@ ched by the fl@@ aps of the entry for the band . &quot;
&quot; before the throw @-@ out of the belt , first the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to achieve this . &quot;
&quot; &amp; c@@ dat ; returns to the band by changing the symbol for the band , that the integration of the band has been solved and displays a corresponding message in the stat@@ us@@ bar . the tape can now be rejected without a risk . &quot;
&quot; before a band of &amp; box ; it can be used , it must be form@@ atted by &amp; c@@ dat ; form@@ atted . &quot;
&quot; a belt area must be form@@ atted , before you use to store data . this process does not correspond to the form@@ atting when using it , it must happen before you can be form@@ atted by the tape of &amp; cold ; flo@@ ppy disk drives are usually putting a form@@ atting of the belt ahead , DAT drives , on the other hand . &quot;
after entering the band@@ name and the capacity de@@ co@@ res the belt ; with the form@@ atting of the belt . all data on the tape will be lost ! after completion of the form@@ atting the band is automatically mounted and is ready to use .
&quot; before you encounter the backup process , you have to select to the securing files . this can happen in three ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it is saved only this file or folder .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are stored .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the so marked files and / or sub@@ folders are secured .
right click on the local file tree and select ...
&quot; once the backup has been initiated , the dialog settings for backup . in this dialog you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog &apos;s dialog shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives on the drive for the drive . it will only be checked the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives on the password for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub @-@ folder are checked .
right click on one of the archives and select the menu entry ...
&quot; once the test process is started , the dialog settings will be started . in this dialog you will once again check your selection and change the bench for the review . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for the review , the dialog will be examined . this dialog shows the progress of the test process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can connect to the re , the files you have to be restored , this can be done in two ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the entry for the band@@ drive . it is restored only the selected file or sub@@ folder .
select the desired files from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folder restored .
right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select to restore in the menu .
&quot; once the recovery process is started , the dialogue settings for restoration . in this dialog you can once again check your selection and change the bench for restoring it . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for the restoration , the dialogue will be re @-@ establish . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
sometimes it proves to be necessary to create the band@@ index file by the Band@@ content . this process delet@@ es all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types of the band :
this will create a backup profile with the currently selected files and default settings . you can make a backup profile the following settings :
&quot; the current labor force , in which the securing is to be carried out . the list of securing files will be automatically updated according to the selected work@@ places . &quot;
&quot; for all folders listed under backup files , that only those files are stored on the same file system , such as the folder . folder that are on other file systems , you can enter separately under backup files , each entry is seen from t@@ ar regardless of the others . &quot;
&quot; perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last in@@ incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file will only be used , which have changed since then . &quot;
the name of the file which is used to determine the changes since the last in@@ incre@@ mental backup .
delet@@ es the snapshot file from the call of t@@ ar . this causes all files to be backed up and set a new snapshot file for the next backup .
the functionality of buttons files &amp; gt ; and lt ; files was not yet fully implemented at the time of creation of this documentation .
you can set the settings via the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu and you can make the following settings :
the full path to the work@@ station for the band@@ drive ( normally / dev / T@@ ape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ channel variant of the belt device .
&quot; this setting is active , transmitted &amp; cold ; before the band is involved the command mt load to the drive . with some drives , this is necessary before reading or des@@ oper@@ able . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched , try &amp; c@@ dat ; the acc@@ us@@ ation of the band@@ drive to bul@@ lock . possibly this attitude does not work with all belt drives . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched , the sol@@ der will be dealt with the inclusion of &amp; col@@ on ; you automatically use the tape . do not use this option at Flo@@ ppy Stream@@ . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched , try &amp; c@@ dat ; the hard@@ war@@ es@@ tic@@ ulous block@@ age for the band@@ drive will change . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you need to communicate &amp; c@@ dat ; in any case you have to communicate the block@@ age for your band &apos;s drive . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; ch@@ dat ; a band form@@ atted , it writes a file to the beginning of the ban@@ ker . this file should only be loaded on the tape . the content of the file is composed as follows : &quot;
&quot; ( N Byte ) The band @-@ ID . the format of this string is specified : seconds , whereby the name of the complete name of the system is , on which the tape was form@@ atted . seconds the number of seconds have passed since the epoch has been form@@ atted . &quot;
the Band @-@ ID is used to use a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
&quot; the remaining files on the tape are pure t@@ ar archives , which can manage directly with &amp; GNU ; - t@@ ar can manage . even other t@@ ar versions should work , as long as it is not about incre@@ mental back@@ ups . &quot;
check the content of a backup system . this symbol is only active when a band is involved .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ viewer for system protocols . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who can &apos;t know where you can obtain information about your system or where the system uses the various protocol files . experienced users can gain quick access to information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; c@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer is in the background . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who do not know where you can &apos;t know where you can obtain information about your system or where the system depos@@ ited the various protocol files .
&quot; in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users can provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore tries to provide some extended functions , with their help the protocol files of certain programs can be fil@@ tered and evaluated . &quot;
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 features &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a range of useful functions . among others include :
&quot; support for many different types of log files , for the format of sy@@ s@@ log @-@ Server and for Sam@@ ba . &quot;
many other functions are also included in addition and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you see in the following screenshot , presents &amp; c@@ system@@ log ; functions available , with their help to filter the single protocol lines of a protocol @-@ file . the individual possibilities to sor@@ ting and filters will be shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after the start , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important protocol @-@ file of the system - the system prot@@ ector is started . you are not shown on Linux normally in the folder / var / log , for the normal user usually does not have permission to read . &quot;
you can also use the filter bar to filter after a selected criterion or on a specified character . enter the list box next to the filter . then a protocol line contains only displayed when in one of the columns contain the strings of the filter search concept .
&quot; you can of course choose another entry on this site . select the filter column , then only with the entries in the selected column settings . select the name of a process , so shows you &amp; c@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines are sent or created by this process . &quot;
this option is activated in default setting and helps you to realize the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level mistakes are shown with a striking colour as a protocol lines of level indication . the colored representation of protocol lines can be activated with dialog .
&quot; if you want to display only a particular process ( e.g. in the system prot@@ ok@@ oll or in the Cr@@ on protocol ) , you can test the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a certain command such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bar . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can jump the option to new lines in the context menu of the main window to view all new added protocol lines . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows you to use multiple protocol files in se@@ perate sub@@ windows . to open this feature set the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub @-@ window and select a window in the menu to display an indication .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website at http : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ so@@ ftw@@ are@@ .@@ org@@ . D@@ ort you can find more information about the supply sources of &amp; c@@ system@@ log .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; in addition you will find in the following folder of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ;
&quot; welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V in@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also as named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the system V in@@ it develops rapidly to the standard for monitoring the program starts in the &amp; Linux ; world , and therefore because it is easier to use , powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it . &quot;
I will not go further to historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it : - ) .
&quot; the in@@ it @-@ binary @-@ file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because maybe someone might attempt to switch a machine to system V in@@ it , without a re@@ install and new format . therefore , you have to think that the old in@@ it was removed from there if there was one . &quot;
the Sy@@ s@@ V in@@ it also differs from the BSD in@@ it that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ d. D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following further folders :
&quot; in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for any system service , which you want to start playing at the high level . system services include such things like network , NFS , &amp; s@@ end@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which only once started . such views belong to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; r@@ c.@@ local should be in the part of / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems do not own any use for it . you can also do a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a bit , what to do with the serial port . &quot;
the kernel is searching for different places according to the program in@@ it and starts the first one finds .
the default cup@@ level is registered in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see a line like the following :
at this point you can throw a look at the second column and probably notice that the pres@@ et Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change it , then you can get rid of the in@@ comes from hand and change the 3 . be sure you can fix it by re@@ boot the system and execute the following : &quot;
&quot; but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you do not fill in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following : &quot;
you will notice that in this folder you are not correct files . instead , each entry is a short@@ cut to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d . &quot;
how starts and stops in@@ it actually System@@ Services ? quite simply : each of the scripts is so written that it is an argument as start and stop accepted . you can actually start those scripts actually manually by hand on the command line :
&quot; this would hold the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if it contains a K , the script will be called with the argument stop . if a S includes , the script will start with the argument . &quot;
&quot; some people want to set up a simple way , machines for many purposes . I could have &amp; eg ; a server @-@ level , which can run only htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; s@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; also , network &amp; etc . ; , network &amp; etc ; starts . &quot;
&quot; here you learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult , because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible . &quot;
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or a different pointer is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six Run@@ level to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
&quot; you can also move the script between Run@@ level@@ n or change the position within one level by changing it from its original Run@@ level ( or its position ) , this will only happen if they withdraw an entry from the available system services . &quot;
&quot; note : entries will be moved , if you want to drag them into a new area . to simply select from the menu editing or from the context menu and then enter into the target area -- even if the same entry has previously existed in the target area of the action . &quot;
the sor@@ ting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case you must edit the sor@@ ting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try to insert the system service .
&quot; note : at present there is no possibility to restore entries , which were thrown into the tr@@ ash . so be careful . &quot;
&quot; you can use the tab@@ ulator button to enable the different work areas ( Available system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection of upper or below the previous one . &quot;
to move a entry into another run@@ level , move it into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X use ) and add it to the desired Run@@ level with C@@ trl ; V ) . &quot;

&quot; all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pres@@ ets are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) , if it is available . otherwise , they are stored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . changes to the pres@@ ets are stored in a local c@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . &quot;
&quot; I have experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ level@@ n , and now the machine starts again . what can I do ? &quot;
enter at the LI@@ LO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t l@@ inux single and press the input button to start in single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the default level at a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be ok ) .

&quot; if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , you must edit additional files in / etc , which are only available in these distribu@@ tions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution . &quot;
&quot; the way systems are started in these distribu@@ tions , simpli@@ fies the configuration for the propriet@@ ory programs of these distribu@@ tions , but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you are using a different distribution : please check if all configuration files are required ( and also , whether they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or htt@@ p@@ d ) simply end without a message if their configuration files are not available or false . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to release . if you use any other distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level so that this manual can be added to this manual . &quot;
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
&quot; to start with &amp; k@@ user ; to start , it is sufficient to read the chapter adjustments of &amp; user ; &quot;

&quot; some card @-@ cards are only represented , if you have advanced settings settings . only when you have advanced settings settings that you can make individual settings , if shadow -@@ passwords need or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as installed in BSD Unix . &quot;
the map @-@ card password appears if shadow -@@ passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as installed in BSD -@@ Uni@@ ces .
this cart@@ on card appears only if for at least one built @-@ in fil@@ es@@ ystem environment ( Qu@@ ota ) and initi@@ alizing it ( recogni@@ zable by the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here you can change parameters each time in KB :
these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current file system is selected using the field of fil@@ es@@ ystem .
&quot; map @-@ card groups inform@@ s about the group related interest of the selected user . the standard group , which includes the user , you will find in the Prim@@ ary Group . furthermore , the user can mark the user in other groups by selecting them in the large field . &quot;
the dialog &apos;s dialog box contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or a group , select exec@@ ut@@ or from the menu user or group or click the matching Add button of the toolbar . the editing or delet@@ ing of the selected users or the selected group is analog . &quot;
