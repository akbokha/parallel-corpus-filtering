<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections of Roh Decodersettings and Roh workflows.</seg>
<seg id="73">"a simple to use camera interface is provided to you, so that you can connect to your digital camera and support your photos directly in & digitization. of course, every medium and every card reader is supported by your operating system, using & digitization."</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are connected by the use of Compact & Flash; Memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transfer. the camera will then be implemented as a turnable device (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras can also use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">"& D came; uses the program gPhoto2 to communicate with digital cameras, a constantly increasing number of over 800 cameras supported. gPhoto2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely spread protocol, which was developed by the International Imaging Industry Association without the need for additional drivers."</seg>
<seg id="76">"many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer. since photos in general are large files and transmission through the serial port slowly, this connection is already obsolete. & digitization also supports these cameras and introduces the transmission of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras will be found under this link."</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 has to be created with purple support to be read and can be read by some libgphoto2 camera channels. if the P50s support is not available in libgphoto2, you will never eat anything or the generating could be very slow. "</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things in & digitization is how easy to extend its functionality by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">"KIPI modules: the KDE Image plugin interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module for & digious, KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and Gwenview. the aim is to provide the modules on all video programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section."</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way as it can also be a user. your advantage is that it's much easier to supplement & digitised; by writing a small module to complement one function than the changes in & digitised; they perform itself.</seg>

<seg id="479">& D came; presents three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">"sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and simple, however, especially in dark areas, grassy images."</seg>
<seg id="481">Insharp Maske is working on the contrast of the edges made to look around a picture. actually it's not a bit like it works rather psychovisual. you can use it to create atmospheric dunce and it's here a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and he is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">"focussing is possibly the best of the three, since it really is the sharpness improved. he is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment."</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without a focus and most digitised images need a correction of sharpness. this in turn leads to a common color together with only minimal differences. the same phenomenon can be observed if color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally need more elongated sharpening as normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">"at JPEG images there is often a camera internal coating. images in the raw format, on the other hand, must always be cured in the processing process."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanner can turn to a lever filter during the reading of the picture. if you disabling this, you will get control of your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get used results by sharpen a photo with the sharpening stables. this allows you to browse with the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">"but you should deal with caution, since the results are not very natural: the sharpening the edges of the edges, but also intensify the smoke. you can reach it via the menu entry reduction. under review, you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too cold. the solution to draw a little soft is much easier than it sharpen. use the tool to switch mould with the menu entry and experiment with your settings. the thumbnails on the right side of the dialog box shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter blurred masquerade is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original picture and the preview help to edit the image. the thumbnails shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and amount. the default values are often good results and should first be tested. an increase in the radius or of the amount will reinforce the effect. if you create the insharply mask, caters and get the impression of atrocities close to sharp edges."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius one how many pixels by each side of a channel are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow bigger radii. you should therefore sharpen the pictures best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the seducted image one of the original is added. thus the strength of the sharpness will be put.</seg>
<seg id="494">"the threshold is a rupture from the maximum RGB value and the difference difference. it can thus be used for a channel difference. in this way, these areas are avoided with a soft change between the tones of sharpening and therefore beauty bugs in faces, Heavens and water surfaces."</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the blurred masking filter. the original image is the (1) and the edited picture the (2). blurred masking was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a tail worth = 0.0. "</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digitization; tool focussing focused on an image by improving the sharpness. it used to be protected by the copyrighted discharge filter by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to anticipate a picture & quot; refocused approach. this is a better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filters. it uses the traditional technique to sharply ply mascot. you can start it from the menu by using colors Refocused in the editing process.</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice the circular flows works much better than the Gauß'sche Faltung. the Gauß'sche Muzzle has a very long tail, which leads to the mathematical result also from the source pixel, which is far from original quellings, which is largely influenced by the distant pixels. the causes of unwanted results."</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the most important parameter for the use of this module. for most pictures the default value 1 good results result. you can put a higher value if your picture should be very blurred but then on Heiligenstadt.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help to reduce artifacts. correlation can be chosen from 0-1. usable values are 0,5 and the values are close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpening effect of the module. "</seg>
<seg id="501">"Rauerfilter: an increase in the prefilter can help you reduce artefacts. however, values higher than 0.1 only rarely can. if the smokfilter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very poor. an appropriate value is 0,03. a high value will continue to move the picture."</seg>
<seg id="502">"Gauß'sche shafts: this is the radius of the Gauß Gauß tray. in most cases you should use this value in 0, to avoid annoying artifacts. in most cases you should use this value to zero, so you might also have to increase the correlation and / oderm filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">Matripper size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the matripper size can produce good results especially if you choose big values for the circular harness or the Gauß's Schärfe. please note that the module is very slow if you choose big values for these parameters. in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">Saving and charging buttons will be used exactly for that purpose. any number of refocused parameters will be set in order for later and can be loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all the cutting, color and intensity corrections on the image before you use the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise, you should use the module before you change the picture otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations changes not immediately visible, but left later unpleasant artifacts."</seg>
<seg id="507">"when you read pictures and compress, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed picture."</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally produces blurred masking better results as sharpening. this could be caused by the blurred masking in a larger neighborhood as sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">"theoretically, you have to create a sharp masking over always artefacts. even under optimal conditions it can never show the effect of the inertia, at least as good as the Insharp Maske. the FIR Wiener Filter is often better in the processing of small details."</seg>
<seg id="510">"below you can see a comparison between different filters, on a small unfocused picture, see:"</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp colour picture has to be corrected. this picture has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus Linse.</seg>
<seg id="512">"for more information on the methods of sharpouring, you can read a technical comparison in English under this address."</seg>
<seg id="513">The regulator smoked the insharpness of the area of the dark blacked to create a natural phalomile.</seg>
<seg id="514">"the colour tinent enables a customized color for the Pupille. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can adjust this here."</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool infusion is one of the most advanced tool to remove not desired artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>

<seg id="517">"this tool contains various presets as a Starpoints, to simplify the restoration. the available presets are below enumerated:"</seg>
<seg id="518">In case you want to adjust the filter settings in a adjust settings you can use the Rider smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">"detail posture p [0, 100]: this controls the maintenance of details. a small value leads to a rightful smoothing across the image. a value of 0,9 should provide details so that no sharpening are necessary."</seg>
<seg id="520">"based on Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes in all directions while a value is close to 1 only in a direction. if you have a film-made or CCD Rauma will produce a high value of woven patterns. JPEG artifacts are best removed in a value near 1."</seg>
<seg id="521">Smoothed [0, 500]: this puts the maximum smoothing factor above all. put this value therefore suitable to the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter involves greater structures. the higher this value is set, the more becomes more smoked when there is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulenzeffects it must be higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: returns how many times the algorithm is going through. usually there is 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">"angle-view page [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of the anisotropen Alpha. if Alpha is small, it should also be small for a long term. you should therefore choose this value as much as possible and for your needs."</seg>
<seg id="525">"integral Schrag page [0,1, 10]: integrally shot-page in pixels. you should put the value smaller 1 to avoid Sub-Pixel Glory and never bigger than 2."</seg>

<seg id="535">"radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) up to 20 (41x41), which is required for the filter. great values increase the time the filter per pixels and allows the image to be absorbed through the image and the color in it is adjusted, and so that minor errors are adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="536">"sharpness: controls the noise level. this value sets the pixelongation changes. if it is lifted, smoking filter will be adjusted. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved and slipping or lubrication again."</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the necessities for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response to the filter. if it is too strong can not occur the entire noise or crawinters. put it on a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a vigilant or JPEG artifacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminous intolerance of the picture. we recommend either color or luminance to change a picture. these settings do not affect the glassment process of the details controlled by the details.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the colour tolerancy of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to change a picture. these settings do not affect the glassment process of the details controlled by the details.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gamma: controls the gintolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerances of the dark areas, which typically tend to increase stronger. it also polluted the shadow ranges."</seg>
<seg id="541">"absorption: controls the ligation of the phasenjittering absorption. this value is defined as fast the adaptive filter radius on variations of the luminance. if it is lifted up, the edges of smoother can occur. he can remove noise and phasenjitter on the edges and is the recommended method for it."</seg>

<seg id="1538">The Kodierer package must be installed by the relevant Linux distribution before the codile can be used. this is also required for the predefined coerers. further information on Kodierer can be found in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>

<seg id="1652">"this is absolutely necessary for synthesizer, which are not general MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-map General-MIDI events are translated into events that synthesizer the synthesizer."</seg>
<seg id="1653">"for example, you can create a MIDI map showing all events of the type Change patch to Bright Piano in events of the type Change patch to Trumpet and therefore always sound a trumpet when originally a piano should play."</seg>
<seg id="1654">"if you have only one soundcard, you don't need any MIDI-map, because all sound cards GM are compatible (including Awe - and CIS cards, FM -devices and so on)."</seg>
<seg id="1655">"there are no programs to create MIDI maps, so you must edit the appropriate file from hand (with your favorite editor)."</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-map is a text file that stores all necessary conversions to play a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">"each section may only appear once, except KEYMAP section that may appear so often as desired. prerequisite for this is, however, that any appearance has a different text ID (see below)."</seg>

<seg id="1661">In this section the patches of General MIDI on your specific keyboard will be illustrated. the general usage looks as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">"please note that the left side of the equation sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM -patches are in the right sequence (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order and do not leave any line for one of the 128 instruments."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"optional all keysTo M is needed to put all notes that need this instrument on the tone with the number M. if your keyboard supports an example (GM-patch 127), you can use a drum (e.g. with clay 60), that is similar to the PATCHMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1664">"so if a MIDI file should play a note with patch 127 (screw-shot), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, regardless of what sound is in the MIDI file."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"please note that the patch is targeted here with the term drum patch (drum, basins, Maracas & etc;) and not the one who means the tone the tone of the always same drum (like him some keyboards)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section will be needed to specify how to be illustrated on a specific channel or instrument.</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as in the PATCHMAP section the order of lines is very important, as well as their presence. you must therefore have 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple Keyboards for each channel and every instrument. you only have to use different names in the first row.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used mainly to make tones on the perkle channel. watch out as an example the provided Keyboards.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to form some channels to others. if you want to exchange for example the first and second channel, you simply make it in CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are useful for Keyboards, which have the perplexes on a specific channel (General MIDI to channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"Midi-Devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, according to the following pattern:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"N is the channel, which is listed on the Channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the keymap needs to be defined in the file name, all events will be ignored that will try the patch on this channel. in this case it will always be Patch x uses."</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Forcepatch option can be useful for example to always use the perkle patch on the Persian canal.</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for PitchBenderRatio gives the value of Pitch-Bender-events. if a MIDI file sends a pitch-Bender-Event with the value n, this with the formula n * (r / 4096) is calculated and then only passed on. the value 4096 is used, so that in the map file is not a decimal number)."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting is needed because GM means that a keyboard, which should play a pitch, which should play a sound higher with the value 4096, but try to play some keyboards up to an octave above. to try to try the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & mid;"</seg>
<seg id="1677">"to use a MIDI-map, just open the dialog MIDI settings. this can be found in the menu under settings, point MIDI settings"</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole range of piano signatures (one for each MIDI channel). on these pianos you can see which sounds are straight.</seg>
<seg id="1679">"you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel. for each channel, there is a selection listing, where you can choose an instrument, the button is no more green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used."</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (until now) two different views to view the split-tones. view in the menu settings under the point channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">"the pace-LCD indicates the speed, which is played with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed."</seg>
<seg id="1682">"you can change the pace of a song. if you find e.g. one song is too fast to follow the text, you can slowdown it down. to change the pace, use the arrows left and right of the LCD."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"a MIDI file is a file that includes information about how a music piece has to be played. it contains the notes, the rhythm, speed, & etc; so that the same MIDI file may result in two different devices to very different results, just as two different musicians play the same notes in a very different way."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"well, I cannot force anyone, & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3-file has a similar sound quality. with a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc. you have control over everything."</seg>
<seg id="1685">"this can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) from & mid; have done. that has happened because & kmid; without Awe support you need to download a source distribution and install (for example from kmid; 's home page)"</seg>

<seg id="2283">"the program used to me only changed the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly was changed within these lines. and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the objection had changed. the merger of these changes was a small nightmare."</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could be able to represent differences within one line and changes to white signs. later all of further useful features were added.</seg>

<seg id="2957">"the system V init develops rapidly to the standard for monitoring the program starts in the & Linux; world, and therefore because it is easier to use, powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -Init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further to historical aspects (e.g. because I don't know about it: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the init-binary-file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because maybe someone might attempt to switch a machine to system V init, without a reinstall and new format. therefore, you have to think that the old init was removed from there if there was one."</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV init also differs from the BSD init that the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc are instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following further folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">"init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically you need a script for any system service, which you want to start playing at the high level. system services include such things like network, NFS, & sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things as setserial, which only once started. such views belong to rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"rc.local should be in the part of / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems do not own any use for it. you can also do a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a bit, what to do with the serial port."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is searching for different places according to the program init and starts the first one finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default cuplevel is registered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can throw a look at the second column and probably notice that the preset Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change it, then you can get rid of the incomes from hand and change the 3. be sure you can fix it by reboot the system and execute the following: "</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it start all the right scripts? if you do not fill in rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that in this folder you are not correct files. instead, each entry is a shortcut to one of the scripts in the directory init.d. "</seg>
<seg id="2968">How starts and stops init actually SystemServices? quite simply: each of the scripts is so written that it is an argument as start and stop accepted. you can actually start those scripts actually manually by hand on the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would hold the httpd server. init reads the name, and if it contains a K, the script will be called with the argument stop. if a S includes, the script will start with the argument."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people want to set up a simple way, machines for many purposes. I could have & eg; a server-level, which can run only httpd, & sendmail;, network & etc; also, network & etc.;, network & etc; starts."</seg>
<seg id="2971">"here you learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult, because the program was created as user-friendly as possible."</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or a different pointer is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six Runlevel to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">"you can also move the script between Runleveln or change the position within one level by changing it from its original Runlevel (or its position), this will only happen if they withdraw an entry from the available system services."</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries will be moved, if you want to drag them into a new area. to simply select from the menu editing or from the context menu and then enter into the target area -- even if the same entry has previously existed in the target area of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"note: at present there is no possibility to restore entries, which were thrown into the trash. so be careful."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the tabulator button to enable the different work areas (Available system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection of upper or below the previous one."</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move a entry into another runlevel, move it into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X use) and add it to the desired Runlevel with Ctrl; V). "</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change the sorting number or the name of a contract manually, press the table button to switch between different fields. use the dialog box to accept the changes, or press Esc to change the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the risk of data, all entries in the menu will require a confirmation before they are carried out."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"all settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. presets are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc), if it is available. otherwise, they are stored by & ksysv. changes to the presets are stored in a local csysvrc."</seg>
<seg id="2982">"I have experimented with the standard Runleveln, and now the machine starts again. what can I do?"</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter at the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default level at a reasonable value (3 should normally be ok).</seg>
<seg id="2984">"I have provided some system services with & ksysv; for the execution under Runlevel X, but they will not be executed."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"if you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you must edit additional files in / etc, which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the way systems are started in these distributions, simplifies the configuration for the proprietory programs of these distributions, but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you are using a different distribution: please check if all configuration files are required (and also, whether they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) simply end without a message if their configuration files are not available or false."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the meaning of the & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to release. if you use any other distribution, please send me information about the runlevel so that this manual can be added to this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">"to start with & kuser; to start, it is sufficient to read the chapter adjustments of & user;"</seg>
<seg id="2991">"once you have made changes, you have to save them. either use the appropriate icon of the toolbar or the entry save in the File menu."</seg>
<seg id="2992">"& kuser; it is an easy application. the main window consists of two boxes, the user-user and the user group. to edit the desired user or the desired group with a double-click on the entry. it appears the dialogue User or group properties."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"some card-cards are only represented, if you have advanced settings settings. only when you have advanced settings settings that you can make individual settings, if shadow -passwords need or for example / etc / master.passwd as installed in BSD Unix."</seg>
<seg id="2994">The map-card password appears if shadow -passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd as installed in BSD -Unices.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This carton card appears only if for at least one built-in filesystem environment (Quota) and initializing it (recognizable by the file quota.user / quota.group on the file system). here you can change parameters each time in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each file system. the current file system is selected using the field of filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="2997">"map-card groups informs about the group related interest of the selected user. the standard group, which includes the user, you will find in the Primary Group. furthermore, the user can mark the user in other groups by selecting them in the large field."</seg>
<seg id="2998">The dialog's dialog box contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list. "</seg>
<seg id="2999">"to add a user or a group, select executor from the menu user or group or click the matching Add button of the toolbar. the editing or deleting of the selected users or the selected group is analog."</seg>
<seg id="3000">"with this module you can install the LILO boot manager, remove and change the time until the boats of the standard operating system, remove the standard operating system, remove, change, change, change and more."</seg>
