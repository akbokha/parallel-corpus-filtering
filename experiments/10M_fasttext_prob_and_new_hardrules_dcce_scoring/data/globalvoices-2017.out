&quot; although I visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is tremendous .
&quot; as many of my generation I grew up with American films , American authors have read American authors and operated their sport . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had such profound impact on me that I was mainly a journalist . &quot;
&quot; as 14 @-@ year old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , who covered with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts as Jura @-@ co@@ ed the mur@@ der@@ ian conspir@@ acy of an oil magn@@ ates who were interested in the Supreme Court with judges who were interested . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free after meth@@ od Man , &quot; I was &apos; s , as if that is the absolute truth , forget everything else , this is what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year that I lived in Arizona , had only reinforced my admir@@ ation for the United States . &quot;
&quot; I always said , &quot; America is the only country where I have ever lived , whose diversity is so welcoming that you are always the one that you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I even had a very dirty love of thinking about his size .
then Donald Tru@@ mp came .
much was written about xen@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most amazing aspect of his as@@ cen@@ sion is for me as he goes with his bott@@ dies .
he never stops behind the mountain as it is so beautiful .
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks , like a former colleague , and explains publicly his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ America and Women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people have responded to his statements and voted in Sh@@ ar for him . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes received , he won at the Republi@@ can pre @-@ elections , was the highest number one by the party nominated ever . &quot;
I was speech@@ less .
&quot; who are the Americans who support this big@@ rot person , I asked me ? &quot;
I could not bring Tru@@ mp and his voters with people in harmony which I met during my time in Phoenix .
&quot; as for example my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , Director of journ@@ alism , people from all over the world takes up a deep breath @-@ based human being , with whom I was talking about Islam and his past . &quot;
&quot; the Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s cosmos does not coinci@@ de with the author of Peter Bh@@ atia , the present editor of the C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot;
&quot; Bh@@ atia and I had arrived at our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix Suns &quot; at the game . &quot;
&quot; intoler@@ ance is also in contrast to gener@@ osity that I lived by Sandy B@@ ahr , who fought her life for the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like their son . &quot;
&quot; it fits her to the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , which always helped me with a lot of patience and grace , and my colleagues helped us to get used to the complexity of American life . &quot;
&quot; then there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , their wise Council helped me a lot with my career . &quot;
these people and those by them em@@ bo@@ died values of my love of America .
&quot; while Tru@@ mp &apos;s path to the nominated rep@@ ublic@@ s presidential data , they offered me a hold and the counter@@ part of his limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out , however , that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on 8 November 2016 , more than 50 million Americans , most of course , the presidency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of its cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the confrontation with the idea that people for Tru@@ mp have agreed , because they were either divided into racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism or because they were ready to over@@ look these things , I broke almost the heart . &quot;
perhaps it is unfair to describe the Tru@@ mp @-@ voters as a r@@ assi@@ sts .
&quot; to arrange the people , one of my friends , is exactly what we have led to this situation . &quot;
&quot; this is super@@ ficial and respect@@ ful and indicates a in@@ ability to understand those , which act in a different way and think . &quot;
it shows the people that their worries and fears about the h@@ ectic changes in their communities are not considered .
&quot; could it be that these voters , most of which are white , for Tru@@ mp , because they want to re @-@ win control over a country which she has disappointed ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they might want to say that they are still important in this America ? &quot;
perhaps .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick who comment the cru@@ el decision to raise a man who look down with cont@@ emp@@ t upon those who look different from it . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( anal . ) . : as much as &quot; &quot; el@@ ong@@ ation of the White against all other Eth@@ ni@@ ches &quot; ; wording of white in fore@@ play on the wh@@ ites and wh@@ i@@ pl@@ ash , which means as much does the big Van Jones n@@ amed , has exactly what America has done so great . &quot;
&quot; million people around the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - what faith or background you may have always like , America is always welcome . &quot;
&quot; for this land , elected as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ y@@ l , whose story , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; but the choice Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s is a huge part of the white Americas , and says : to hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole concept of plur@@ alism . &quot;
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back on the ruin .
&quot; in all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier , who has fallen in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
on a demonstration for Hill@@ ary Clinton had a change of change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp , would have my son , captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; Mr. Khan asked . &quot;
the crowd answered with a loud &quot; no ! &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; br@@ aces the crowd .
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; answered them . &quot;
have A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they were and their voices were loud . &quot;
&quot; if someone who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; NE@@ IN &quot; !
&quot; Mr. Khan closed with the words : &quot; &quot; God is thanks , Mr. Tru@@ mp , is that not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the land , for which his son was , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now Tru@@ mp@@ s Land , told the message . &quot;
&quot; and all people who look like Mr. Khan , could no longer find any place in this new America . &quot;
and that leaves me my heart .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean town of Cat@@ e@@ ura ?
&quot; that the music , which is played in both places , not only the lives of the children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with waste
&quot; Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is situated on the edge of a large gar@@ bage dump , just 16 km south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an ancient colonial city which is very popular among the tourists - but worlds away from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; for some years now , the La B@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( Musik@@ ban@@ de ) has now been playing an existing Symphony Orchestra , which has found an opportunity to overcome many poverty with their musical instruments . &quot;
a music school with 100 students has become central for the municipality of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the church , which is located in one of the poorest provinces of the Mex@@ ic@@ os , is known for its drugs abuse and the violence @-@ violence . &quot;
&quot; however , this changed after a random meeting with a French pil@@ ots , who started a musical project and the youth made so a rare hop@@ el@@ essness . &quot;
&quot; the young members of the members take their commitments towards the music group very seriously , the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca n@@ vi : &quot;
&quot; once they come from school , they walk back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to see their great passion . &quot;
&quot; they come always smiling and with sh@@ iny eyes and play in the tru@@ bel you learn day for day trumpet , tromb@@ one , pic@@ colo , clarinet , oboe , flute , forests , Bon@@ g@@ os and the Con@@ ga . &quot;
music from Tr@@ ash
&quot; more than 7.@@ 000 kilometers south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero games the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village , which is practically located at the largest gar@@ bage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments that are made of recycl@@ able waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with re@@ prepared instruments that consist of local firm waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura where the recycl@@ ed under direction of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez have begun to transform parts of waste in instruments . &quot;
&quot; instruments im@@ itate , viol@@ as , C@@ elli , contr@@ ab@@ outs , guitars , flutes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trumpets , tromb@@ ones and percussion , who were all produced from the tr@@ ash . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire comprises classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ic and Latin American music and music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article of Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local Ö@@ k@@ ologist and Musi@@ cians of the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura , to the initial time : &quot;
&quot; first , it was very difficult because we didn &apos;t have a place to rehear@@ sals but we had to teach at the same place to contact the parents in the tr@@ ash . children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them do not live with their children . &quot;
&quot; this changed somewhat as F@@ avi@@ o , what he had never seen before : a waste from waste . &quot;
&quot; today , there is an entire orchestra which plays on instruments of recycl@@ ed material and called The Recy@@ cl@@ ed Orchestra . &quot;
a documentation named &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic gar@@ bage dump ) shows the musical performance :
the world creates approximately one billion tons of tr@@ ash each year .
those who are living with him and live by him are the poorest people like the people in Cat@@ e@@ ura ( Paraguay .
and here they transform him into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspir@@ ational acting of tr@@ ash music around the world .
the orchestra did even play his music from Pope Francis :
these Eastern African countries show how technology and teamwork can be successful on illegal fishing
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that fought the wild fishing fishing .
&quot; this article , written by Emma Bry@@ ce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , published in a magazine that targeted solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
the re @-@ publication happens in the context of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for sharing content .
&quot; in West Africa was then known that this ship had already operated in liberal waters illegal fishing , before it was raised the other coast of Africa . &quot;
&quot; the East African countries were therefore brought about accordingly , and little gen@@ ial to welcome a legislative bre@@ aker of this kind of its co@@ asts . &quot;
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and the Seychelles mobil@@ ised themselves rapidly against the ship . they ref@@ uted him to share one of their ports and gave himself to give him a fishing fix@@ ion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; Ur@@ suddenly , the prime minister was surrounded by countries that you simply ref@@ used all &quot; , &quot; reminds of Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a leader of the Ken@@ yan fisheries authority . he is part of a team that discovered the ship &apos;s time and followed . &quot;
in 2013 the ship was driven out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch fish there .
&quot; finally , it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars in Liber@@ ia , due to the lack of fish stocks . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , the criminal practices crossed and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO Stop Ill@@ egal Fishing ( Ill@@ egal Fis@@ her@@ ies ) . &quot;
&quot; the members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar the six countries , which at that time the prime minister had driven out of their waters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; so we have eight countries , which are like @-@ minded and work together . they exchange information and stand out each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , leader of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts project En@@ ding Ill@@ egal Fishing . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
illegal fishing is by definition un@@ regulated : what is caught by it is hidden that because it is extremely difficult to start @-@ up . thus the illegal fishing is a major part of the survi@@ ving of regions .
&quot; due to the int@@ enti@@ onal dis@@ regard of existing laws , through which certain habitats and species are to be protected , the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems , can cause a delicate balance . &quot;
&quot; but while actions against illegal fishing once were hin@@ dered by bureaucr@@ atic hur@@ d@@ les and also through the sn@@ ail emp@@ iri@@ cal , with the information between individual countries , so these actions occur in real time , with tr@@ ack@@ able at F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; there , the individual countries can share existing licenses for example , news about susp@@ ects news or details that have noticed or experienced during a port spec@@ ulation . &quot;
&quot; Fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive when it move around the open sea , using satellite data . &quot;
&quot; this makes it possible to identify the authorities to record ships that fish in vain areas . also , let &apos;s discover so susp@@ ected driving routes - about such that a ship invites its fish on the road to other ships . &quot;
&quot; the idea could show such investigations whether the participating ships have a fishing license , where they were on the road , and possibly also whether they have a criminal register . &quot;
&quot; countries that are against illegal fishing , can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports . what means that ships will not sell their charges . and that they can even be forced to numbers of pen@@ alties , as in the case of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a significant financial loss for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , leading director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consultant company that advoc@@ ates the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
a closed Front
&quot; the already mentioned platform was created to gain valued 20 million USD to lost sales , which will lose the eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i every year because of illegal fishermen who penet@@ rate in East African waters . &quot;
East @-@ Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fish@@ ings that attracts the region of commercial fishing from around the world . among these also those illegal fishermen .
&quot; these practices , among other promotions , like the sailing under fal@@ ter flag , f@@ ake roy@@ alties , indication of fant@@ asi@@ en@@ ame , the fish @-@ protected species and the fish in nature conservation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they specifically use the lack of international co @-@ operation and make the weaknesses of a non @-@ complete control system &quot; , &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; earlier a ship could not have been illegal and a country could not say &apos; you dar@@ ling my port &apos; . &quot;
&quot; but another country could say &apos; Kom@@ m to me &apos; . &quot; &quot; and precisely this legal Schl@@ u@@ pf@@ lo@@ ch is trying to close the F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
so far the closed front works .
since its foundation F@@ ISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 investigations of compar@@ ative ships .
&quot; it has criminal networks revealed to spread the counter@@ f@@ ake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that are used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties , and it has been persec@@ uted ships and found . &quot;
&quot; due to its collaboration with Inter@@ pol , the international authority to combat crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i is able to share information on illegal fishing across large distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; he builds a system that should help the F@@ ISH @-@ i , susp@@ ects ships precise . &quot;
photo with friendly permission of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; Fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is always further developed , also helps to hide the illegal ships who like to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position . and that we try to cross @-@ cross , &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Ch@@ ef@@ analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g M@@ at Tracking , a N@@ RO which also deals with fisheries data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
some of the ships turn off for instance their automatic identification systems that they cannot be gro@@ unded more of satellite .
&quot; Cop@@ eland helps to build a system that connects various information levels together . it is supposed to help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find criminal ships with greater precision . &quot;
a model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team African nations actually influence influence on the undoubtedly global issue of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth recently opened the Platform Global Fishing Watch : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide with the position of each trac@@ table ship worldwide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighbors to get a better picture of what is doing - this is simply sense , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and b@@ undle their resources for the study . &quot;
&quot; we should do this on a global level . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project to run , where a global system allows the tracking of ships . &quot;
&quot; there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only feel crime , but they also sh@@ out . &quot;
ships used to count earlier without a license and hardly to be reck@@ oned with consequences that they are observed .
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in the F@@ ISH @-@ i participated in the meantime a 33 % increase in the fishing gear , since then fishing boats have more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had put , Gre@@ ko 1 stopped , found the insp@@ ectors there on board s@@ epp@@ e whose use is prohibited . &quot;
photo with friendly permission of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; in West Africa a year will disappear several hundreds of millions of dollars through illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 six countries joined together , to the so called West Africa Task Force . they now fight against illegal fishing , based on exactly the same model such as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; With safety the goal , even more such initiatives and structures also arise in other regions , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member of Somalia could report its first great tri@@ umph : in October it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship which was under fal@@ scher &apos;s flag . and not only was the ship used without license and were banned by now . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also penet@@ rated to ban waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the taking of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 put a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i , this is a further success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a special , collaborative work is actually working in the whole world sea . Emma Bry@@ ce is freelance journalist and lives in London . there she writes on the topic of environment , technology and nutrition . &quot;
&quot; your article will appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and in the Guardian . situation in Venezuela goes on to : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of con@@ quer the country . &quot;
the street movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of severe demonstrations .
they are regarded as a protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum held by President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the Review of Venezuela ) can be found both images of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them .
&quot; the debate is also led in other parts of the country - among other things in the low@@ lands of Bar@@ inas , in the regions of Mé@@ rida and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , centrally located north @-@ north of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the State of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the political and economic situation of the country has deteri@@ or@@ ated continuously , which makes itself noticeable in the everyday life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by a ac@@ ute lack of food and medication . &quot;
many representatives of the opposition saw in the Am@@ t@@ sen@@ th@@ ence of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro the chance of a fundamental change ; however ultimately the re@@ tention of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities .
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ employed at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ izes in its latest articles the context of the Government &apos;s process : &quot;
&quot; within the framework of the social , political and economic crisis , in which the inflation and violence declined to the highest all over the world ( the inflation is estimated at 500 % as the only way to give the country the chance to re@@ con@@ quer its institutional structures and close a new governance . &quot;

&quot; on Twitter , pictures , can tell of conflicts , as well as reports of repression and failure . &quot;
particularly large waves suggested the message over police repression in the central north @-@ north town of Marac@@ ay .
there the prot@@ esters went back into the local cathedral to protect itself according to their own statement from the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government .
&quot; hours later they were able to leave the cathedral again , but the protests went further . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country , some prot@@ esters are to stick to the police forces , including those women in the An@@ des @-@ State T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira : &quot;
&quot; the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira bear no sk@@ irts , because one could see something else about what many nationalities have not ! &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , an Info@@ graphic makes the amount of repression per day : &quot;
thus the dictatorship of the country has supp@@ ressed .
many representatives of the government had demonstrated the validity of the claim after a ministers of ministers - this was now demonstrated in the eyes of many through the presence of inn@@ umer@@ able people on the road .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Labs :

&quot; others consider these protests as a further step in the fight against a government , which has undertaken a little against the devast@@ ating economic crisis , and rather than it deals with critical voices : &quot;
you have taken us so much - but also the fear !
the mar@@ ches are getting more and more of frequency and intensity .
&quot; some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media , they are hungry to participate in a strike instead of working or to purchase . &quot;

&quot; this is an adapted version of a interview by Ale@@ jo Gó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qu@@ ij@@ ano , which was posted on 23 August 2016 on d@@ ía a d@@ ía , an Argent@@ inian news page . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and published here with kind permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qu@@ ij@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the atro@@ cities in La Perla , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city of Córdoba . &quot;
as an adult man Qu@@ ij@@ ano said now within the framework of the great La Perla @-@ Ri@@ bera process in the province of Cordoba against his father .
&quot; in the process , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were examined , which were committed during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qu@@ ij@@ ano has not chosen his life .
&quot; starting at the Bür@@ de , the same name as his father to carry the brutal military per@@ ations in the prison of La Perla , which he observed in the age of 15 years , he has suffered enough . &quot;
for 34 years he held the sur@@ ger@@ m for himself .
&quot; at that time , I believed that was in order . &quot;
I felt like a sal@@ ary .
as a child of 15 years you don &apos;t notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
&quot; I was not able to know that my father was a th@@ ief , Fol@@ terer and mur@@ derer . &quot;
&quot; Luis I had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qu@@ ij@@ ano was G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie@@ fly . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of State of State , was his father from 1976 until 1978 dep@@ uty comm@@ ander of the Secret Service division of 141 in the prison of La Perla . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qu@@ ij@@ ano .
Archi@@ ving .
&quot; this is not the story of Luis Qu@@ ij@@ ano , the op@@ press@@ ors , which is charged for kid@@ n@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and the ab@@ duction of a 10 @-@ year child . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qu@@ ij@@ anos son , a man who had seen the extent of the atro@@ cities which he had seen as a boy , and who said before a Bundes@@ court against his own father . &quot;
&quot; his story shows that great power has a parent on his child , and how this child chose a way of salvation . &quot;
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went with us into the sports hall . there I was with a boy un@@ rounded , the mar@@ tial arts . &quot;
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black white photo and called for me to identify my friend .
he said :
&quot; you are a Ar@@ sch@@ hole , you have rounded yourself with one of the ERP . &quot;
pass only on that they will not lead you one day and I have to save you .
&quot; the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for Ej@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revolu@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo , - revolution@@ aries &apos;s military arm - the military arm of the revolution@@ aries of Argentina . &quot;
&quot; therefore , he offered me to go back into the sports hall . some days later he took me to work on the military base . &quot;
&quot; he said to me , I would become sick . &quot;
I was 15 years old and I thought I was fine . for so my father was educated .
&quot; on the military base , I had to destroy Pap@@ ers that heard the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; these were all possible documents : degrees degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , pro@@ pag@@ an@@ da@@ material , books , just everything . &quot;

&apos;@@ da dr@@ as@@ et the prisoners are tor@@ tured
&quot; my father took me a total of four , La Perla at all in 1976 . &quot;
during the first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car .
&quot; when he took me the second time , he comm@@ anded me to get out . he led me to a bar@@ ac@@ ke , in the cars , furniture , television , refriger@@ ators - just everything possible . &quot;
everything of it was st@@ olen .
&quot; he gave me a small into a blank@@ et and comm@@ anded me to wear it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a great cl@@ ump of silver . &quot;
on that day I went to the other end of the Bar@@ ac@@ ke where the st@@ olen objects were placed and stopped me with a gu@@ ide@@ post .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
and the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
&quot; I sh@@ aded , and saw a li@@ ege that were tor@@ tured on men . &quot;
it looked like a field @-@ bed and metal @-@ feathers .
&quot; later I found out that she was attached to the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person , which was at the body of the person . &quot;
&quot; it is rarely a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , over@@ shot him with water and ch@@ asing him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts in the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the stu@@ d@@ rank there in was horri@@ ble ... like a narrow win@@ del .
&quot; years later , when my father stood under house rest , the same smell came from his room . &quot;
I realized the smell immediately and I became clear that the smell of a body in need is .
I could never forget that smell .
and I asked me : how is it possible to do so much suffering a person ?
&quot; I knew that these people were killed &quot;
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were captiv@@ ated with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were killed and eyel@@ id . &quot;
&quot; he spoke with &quot; &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilians who was also indic@@ ted in the trial ) and I used the opportunity to take a look at La cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which nude people with their face down@@ ward - all were at hands and feet .
close to the entrance to the entrance k@@ ills people silent on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; when my father noted that I saw among the prisoners , he said , &quot; What do you think so , Ar@@ sch@@ hole ? &quot;
&quot; I missed , Why did you otherwise brought me ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed by soldiers and buried .
&quot; I know that , because my father told at home . &quot;
&quot; beside La cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero there struck a man and sle@@ w a man .
&quot; ( according to the survi@@ vor@@ s of civilians , Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero who was also indic@@ ted at La Perla @-@ Ri@@ bera trial in La Perla @-@ Ri@@ bera trial , the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) . &quot;
&quot; in the following video Emili@@ o F@@ essia , the manager of the memorial La Perla , by the former tor@@ ter@@ br@@ aces . &quot;
&quot; the path that you came here is also the way , on which the escape came here . &quot;
&quot; look at the map , see that they took about this path and then tor@@ tured for the first time . &quot;
here their names have changed and they got a number assigned as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
&quot; when they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order came from above that they should be moved . &quot;
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the dis@@ appearance of their corp@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; war@@ fare &apos;
my Father brought all sorts of st@@ olen things with home .
at that time at the age I had no idea what the &quot; war@@ fare &quot; - as she called it - was .
&quot; but when I was later when the military was , - I was in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie - I was clear that war@@ fare was a bay@@ on@@ et or maybe military sign that one has fought one enemy , which one has fought . &quot;

&quot; but when you go into a house and the refrigerator , the turn@@ table , clothes , paintings , money ... sti@@ cking , then that is not war , but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I always wonder@@ ed how my Father , the manager of security forces , with this v@@ and@@ alism could join in this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I don &apos;t understand it .
&quot; I was also an officer at the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never stop , to penet@@ rate into a house and to ste@@ al everything in it . &quot;
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; once he called me a crime , and I rep@@ lied : and you , which thou sti@@ st the cars on the street ? &quot;
you are not crimin@@ als ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded before w@@ ut , sm@@ ote me and cri@@ ed : &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , then I will find you and bring you stand . &quot;
&quot; for this , we no one need others ! &quot;
so my father was .
I have no one good memory of him .
&quot; when I said in the process , I showed a photo of then , on which I carried a jacket and a wheel@@ er @-@ lover from w@@ ool . both had my father from La Perla . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he still brought clothing to home . &quot;
&quot; at that time defended me the defence , an contribut@@ or in this crime have been to be . I ref@@ unded , no problem , they can put me to the burden what they wanted . &quot;
I was anyway there to tell .
&apos;@@ the dis@@ appearance of the corp@@ se is the last ab@@ om@@ able act &apos;
&quot; now , where I am older , I find Reu@@ ben . &quot;
&quot; I have children . if you have only children , one recogni@@ zes the value of a life . &quot;
one develops on and realize that it is wrong to kill .
I was even so far to say :
&quot; well , you have been ex@@ it@@ ated during the dictatorship of the dictatorship . but what the corp@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
why children kid@@ n@@ apped ?
&quot; one day my father brought a girl with her home , whose mother was killed . &quot;
&quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I always asked me the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
they could have simply put it into prison .
&quot; I guess it was simply decided to kill these people , but what their corp@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
did these people not also have families to which one could pass their mor@@ tal remains ?
the dis@@ appearance of the corp@@ se is the last ab@@ om@@ able act that man can do a man .
&quot; my father told me , when Democracy has been introduced again , they hol@@ ten machines to eliminate the dying rem@@ n@@ ants of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were cr@@ ashed and somewhere else - no idea where . &quot; you will never find something , &quot; said my Father . &quot;
but something remains of course always .
I have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 crime - including my Father .
&quot; the thought to view my Father , arose during a conversation , when he stood under house@@ ar@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; I made him embarrass@@ ed due to all of the atro@@ cities , which I had to experience . &quot;
&quot; then he said suddenly , &quot; I do not know . I have no one killed . &quot;
&quot; I felt hes@@ it@@ ated and asked me , wo@@ unded to the entire patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; , &quot; which they suppos@@ edly defended them . &quot;
then I cri@@ ed :
how can you tell me something ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you were forced to join me as a child .
he ref@@ uted only &quot; Na then let me know . &quot;
this is what I did .
2010 @-@ refundable I re@@ funds the first ad .
I finally realized that he was a crime .
nobody can imagine that I &apos;m pres@@ et . I finally said against my own Father .

a translation error makes elderly people in Kyoto to &quot; fri@@ gh@@ able drivers &quot;
the sign with the translation mistake at a centre in Kyoto in which one can extend his driving licence .
the photo was distributed in the social media .
processing of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese city Kyoto , customers were Kyoto of a newly opened center in which one can extend his leadership , last month witnesses of a very particularly mis@@ erable translation . &quot;
&quot; on a shield the Japanese word of it has been done . &quot; &quot; ( co@@ rei@@ below sh@@ a ) , the &quot; older drivers &quot; means , and perhaps also with vi@@ cious rear @-@ than@@ king &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as a &quot; fear@@ able drivers &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was on electronic ads on electronic ads in the input area and in the building itself .
editing the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine that has been divided into social media .
&quot; the bug was the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a inhabit@@ ant of Ky@@ otos , it was also where the locom@@ otive was attentive . &quot;
the daily newspaper Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an ins@@ ult to older people and in an international city such as Kyoto simply &quot; , &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot;
&quot; the faul@@ ty English translation was initially removed . the name &quot; &quot; drivers &quot; &quot; was later replaced by the appropriate note , if gram@@ mati@@ cally not entirely correct term &quot; El@@ der drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the police of the Pre@@ fecture is ap@@ olog@@ ised for the translation error . furthermore , they explained that the bug was already contained in the text they had been checked by the translators and that the translation was not checked for their correctness before it was published . &quot;
a blog@@ gers reported as follows on the ap@@ ologies :
&quot; we are sorry that older people felt through insufficient correction ( the translation ) in my turn , &quot; said the Police . &quot;
the Japanese online news @-@ service J @-@ Cast News set a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of the &quot; fear@@ less &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; fear@@ less &quot; has been den@@ oun@@ ced as in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the share of older drivers which are involved in accidents , but quite cause for concern . &quot;
&quot; for example , in the pre@@ fecture of Kyoto , for example were caused in 2005 1,@@ 9@@ 41 from a total of 19.@@ 460 accidents . this corresponds to a share of 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , seniors 1.8@@ 03 from a total of 11.@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
&quot; in this way , their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % . &quot;
&quot; while the number of accidents has declined altogether , the proportion of those inci@@ dents caused accidents in the same period has risen . &quot;
&quot; the name @-@ mentioned re@@ por@@ ter brought in the article published in Yahoo released version of the article Comments to the Light , which show some Japanese prejudi@@ ces seemingly against older drivers : &quot;
&quot; the article on Yahoo by the translation error , among other things , the following comments received : &quot;
- &quot; Is this ( &quot; fear@@ ed motor@@ ists &quot; ) about not the reality ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; So not the translation is not at all , or ? &quot;
- I don &apos;t find that this is a real translation error .
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gra@@ ish &quot; is so common in all Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and Asia .
the website En@@ gra@@ ish@@ .com is a true discovery for this bizarre error in English .

the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are mani@@ fold .
&quot; to get back , you need two important skills : passive voice knowledge to understand the source text and to transmit active language knowledge to transmit it into the target language . &quot;
&quot; the latter requires the active master@@ y of the target language - something that in the case of the case . in general , the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - mother@@ language . &quot;
&quot; thus , a French native language should translate into French an example from English into French - not from French into English . &quot;
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ User Karl Bar@@ on .
&quot; many Japanese firms do not employ workers with English as our native language , translations into English . this may be due to error message for over@@ lay , cost reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers that learn jap@@ anese . &quot;
&quot; some companies , who don &apos;t have any foreign employees , let translations still have finished . then the Japanese staff , whose English knowledge is done to be the best , no matter how good or bad his language knowledge really are . &quot;
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ User Karl Bar@@ on .
machine translation are also widely used - often with funny results .
the wor@@ r@@ ens and mysterious sent@@ ences created by mechanical translations created that this technique cannot replace too long for any human translator . this applies to some languages very special .
&quot; some of the rar@@ ity of English formulations in Japan , including the mysterious atri@@ prints , which often decorate T @-@ shirts or bags , are used only for styl@@ istic reasons - not read or understood to be understood . &quot;
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ User Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors like jewelry still acceptable or at least harmless . however , by major companies or from the government who have the means to ensure higher standards , one can be careful . &quot;
the city Kyoto uses a rep@@ utable source for their translations in the future .
Venezuela : take protests and actions on the internet and television
&quot; Main@@ page of the Port@@ als &quot; Nav@@ eg@@ ar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , 7 April , mel@@ ted ven@@ ez@@ an internet , that they could no longer have access to the online transmitter Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that the Internet portals of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ oli@@ o TV is no longer accessible . &quot;
other online radio stations over@@ took recordings of the protests in Car@@ acas who were organized by sacrific@@ ing groups who oppose the government of Nicol@@ ás Ma@@ du@@ ros .
&quot; the protests started at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court was dis@@ solved the Parliament and passed the tasks of the Parliament on the executive and the upper court itself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Tr@@ ac@@ er@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection is linked , and recommended the users , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the internet . &quot;
# C@@ ensu@@ r : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet sites of ven@@ ez@@ ol@@ anic provider is closed again .
this is from the side of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
&quot; offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; since 2014 , traditional media has been reported in the coverage of protests . at that time the Commission would report to them with monetary policy and closing , when they continue to report about the demonstrations , since the Commission saw this as a &quot; call to violence &quot; . &quot; &quot;
without cable TV and informative national television channels I have signed up again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
surprisingly that this continues to be cheaper than two lit@@ res of Lim@@ on@@ ade .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro confirmed later , that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is in@@ accessible through a blocking of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online transmitter . this also concerns the website , on which the National Assembly carries its meetings . &quot;
&quot; earlier post @-@ for@@ ger@@ ies of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had surrender to the local Internet providers to stay DNA . this is a technique that may be missing from the DNS server requests from certain domains . &quot;
&quot; if a website is blocked by the DNS , respon@@ ds the server or deny the request at the call of such a website . &quot;
we confirm a DNS locking : @ el@@ eventh oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net &quot;
&quot; on V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , the transfer on Thursday , the 6th of April , adjusted , when the V@@ PI@@ TV @-@ Camer@@ am@@ ann El@@ vis Flo@@ res , which took place the protests in Car@@ acas . &quot;
Flo@@ res has been be@@ aten while he was in police cr@@ ust .
&quot; eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went back to broadcast . &quot;
&quot; although some channels have been accessible via YouTube , it was also reported that the Government regul@@ ates the Internet connections : thus the Venezu@@ el@@ ans will continue to gain access to m@@ ultim@@ edi@@ al reporting on current events in the country . &quot;
in Paraguay many girls become slave to get a training
Tina Al@@ var@@ enga was as a child a cri@@ ad@@ ita . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
&quot; today , Tina for the rights of children and coll@@ ects witness of other Cri@@ ad@@ itas , which were exactly how they were victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;

&quot; the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated version of a report of curiosity , published by Global Vo@@ ices with kindly permission of the authors . &quot;
&quot; the article is part of a series called &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ elas que &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; F@@ lying cows , exp@@ iry schools &quot; ) , edited by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America and re @-@ posted . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ enga lived eight years in a household in which she was not working together with the family , who was allowed to eat . &quot;
&quot; shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the University she returned to the house once again , as the owner of the house was filled with pride about them . &quot; &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot;
&quot; the one has become a little , &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ enga has never been treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old she began to work as a Cri@@ ad@@ ita for the family . as Cri@@ ad@@ itas , one referred to in Paraguay that are more than 46.@@ 000 boys and girls who are comp@@ elled to work to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is very simple : a big family with little money sur@@ passes their min@@ der son or her min@@ age daughter to another , abundant family . in exchange the child receives food , a training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; however , what is not mentioned here is that children do not need to do countless days of house@@ work , which can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this within the framework of a contract that cannot be up@@ lift . &quot;
&quot; these as a cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go , in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous ail@@ ments of human rights organisations widely spread . &quot;
&quot; after completing his studies , Al@@ var@@ enga worked for a couple of years for an organization dedicated to the rights of the boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , she spoke with Cri@@ ad@@ itas - especially young girls affected by the practice of the Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go - raised stuff , researched and p@@ ran@@ ged . &quot;
&quot; she tried to name things on behalf , because the feeling of gratitude that is vacc@@ inated the Cri@@ ad@@ itas , guaranteed in general still silent . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go is based on a double plate , explains Al@@ var@@ enga . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family who is her daughter in faith that they conclude so their education to do their position in society and make something out of themselves , to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family who takes up the girl with himself and made its exploitation by faith that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and perhaps even star@@ ve . &quot;
the victims of the Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go
&quot; when the girl is mis@@ leading , his family will experience only many years later . &quot;
sometimes they never experience them .
&quot; in January 2016 , the so far been relatively un@@ familiar phenomenon that takes place in Ver@@ bor@@ gens in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen households , but a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ ín at Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú came to hospital , her body showed traces of severe be@@ ats . shortly thereafter they died . &quot;
it was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the household of the former military din@@ ran@@ ce Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo who works as an official in the population .
&quot; Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ re@@ ira suggested as long as with a stick on Mar@@ ín , until they suffered fatal injuries . &quot;
this should be the last cut in the life of the young girl .
a few days later the media reported about the incident .
they bet@@ ra@@ yed that the blessed child was a Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
organizations such as UNIC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deep in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen society rooted in practice of the Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go in the death of the girl .
they identified the Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
&quot; several dozen people came together to protest ings , and called for &quot; &quot; no other Carolina &quot; &quot; in Paraguay . &quot;
the name of the girl and photos were widely spread in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered as children , def@@ endant Tina Al@@ var@@ enga . &quot;
&quot; without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children . &quot;
&quot; without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbors of the sp@@ a@@ ars and almost 60 civil society organizations called for a long @-@ scale study of the fall .
&quot; they want , Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was to be sentenced to 30 years in prison . &quot;
&quot; if the case occurs before judgment , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be a case of Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go in the history of Paraguay . &quot;
the everyday life of a Cri@@ ad@@ ita
&quot; Cri@@ ad@@ itas are not only exploited as labour @-@ workers , they also live isolated from other girls in their age . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ enga was ten years old , when the Far@@ ob@@ ics , who worked in her father , teaching Spanish and lost his father his work . &quot;
&quot; your brothers had to go now all work , and started to sell on the street or on the market sweets to make money . &quot;
but they all went on to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón in the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
&quot; in the house of her employer , Al@@ var@@ enga worked out between four and six hours every day . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , they had to share the time so that you still have time to learn . &quot;
she stood each morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared breakfast for their employers .
&quot; for example , they puri@@ fied the fridge , p@@ utz@@ te the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor . &quot;
&quot; when the school was at the end , she went back home and had time to learn . &quot;
&quot; the more she was finished with learning , the more free time she had . &quot;
&quot; but even this time was limited , because they had to make dinner for their employers . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ var@@ enga says they never had to star@@ ve , but I was also not un@@ bo@@ unded food . &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the library of the landlord as food out of the refrigerator , &quot; reminds them . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belon@@ ged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , which was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; some ab@@ uses of the landlord Al@@ var@@ enga , next to him and to read refl@@ ections from Op@@ position@@ ists like &quot; &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; &quot; or &quot; El Pueb@@ lo &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , he tried to convince them to give the reports of official media about the regime of the dict@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; he kept them for intelligent , but did not holding it with her . &quot; the landlord had someone found , who listened to , while he spoke about politics , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they allowed me not often to visit my family because they were the opinion that I would like to learn again &quot; poor habit . &quot; so they said Al@@ var@@ enga , which would speak to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ í , home again her mother tongue Guar@@ an@@ í . &quot;
&quot; their Lord fear@@ ed that they had the education , which they had enabled them to lose again , explains her . &quot;
&quot; however , it was entirely clear that she got for everything they had been paid by them , with their hard work . &quot;

&quot; because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents , a Cri@@ ad@@ ita is . &quot;
I was unable to invite anyone to my home . I had no freedom of friends at school or in the neighborhood .

the company cheap the Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go
in January 2015 a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can find vac@@ ancies for cleaning and n@@ anny in Paraguay .
&quot; the administration in the group is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city bear@@ er in the As@@ unci@@ ón district . &quot;
hello ! I am looking for a little companion for my little daughter who plays in the morning and in the afternoon with her .
to learn .
please fill in .
start from Monday when possible .
the ad got five &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the village Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she could have a el@@ eventh girl and gave her phone number .
&quot; another woman who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 years old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty &quot; , &quot; wrote them . &quot;
&quot; the third comment was written by a girl from the inland , which would like to work . &quot;
then the fi@@ bers of the ad switched to once again :
&quot; dear friends , I have found one . I look if it works with her . &quot;
&quot; thank you , I am writing again , if something is . &quot;
the business was complete .
in pro@@ log to the report Cri@@ ad@@ itas , ¿ asta cu@@ án@@ do ?
&quot; ( Cri@@ ad@@ itas , how long still ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies , former Cri@@ ad@@ itas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z : &quot;
&quot; in the course of our history , we managed to establish systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ada@@ z@@ go ( a practice coming from the early Con@@ quer@@ ors ) , in which the Spanish Con@@ qui@@ res had to be taken care of and to their &quot; wives , &quot; that the Spanish Con@@ qui@@ ver has to be asser@@ ted in the Spanish Con@@ quer@@ ors and to their wives . therefore , it &apos;s not to justify that many girls and boys come into a system of slavery in which they will become light victims of abuse and exploitation . &quot;
social inequality in Paraguay and that of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon is known as Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go .
legislation writes Egyptian users of social media to register in the government

six@@ ty Egyptian parliam@@ ent@@ sia have recently agreed to put law on the rule of law on the use of usage and utility of social networks .
&quot; when he is accepted by the Parliament , the makers and users must register social media in Egypt with a government authority in order to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law , then a place would be set up , which is charged with citizens to share social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months of acceptance of the law , those who would have to register and register users on the site of the site with their right names and staff members in order to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; will it be reconc@@ iled this , so this could bring a penalty up to six months of cu@@ sto@@ dy or an ATM . &quot;
&quot; the legisl@@ ature , which consists of six par@@ agr@@ pen@@ alties and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any use , which runs through the Internet and used to communicate with others by means of voice , video clip and text . &quot;
&quot; it is un@@ clear as the law is going through , since the draft is no indication of how Egyptian authorities should not register any of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure regulation on the level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , parliament of Parliament and Patr@@ ons of the Legisl@@ ative Office , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users receive a user name and password &quot; to get through the fire@@ wall , the Facebook blocked . &quot;
&quot; this could mean that Egypt is planning to educate a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . due to which it would be necessary for Egypt , information about their identity to access the network . &quot;
but it is not yet known that such plans are to exist .
expert and expert on site are sc@@ ep@@ tical concerning the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research T@@ echnolog@@ ist ( in German &quot; leading research &quot; &quot; ) of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egypt Initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , &quot; said Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I &apos;m strongly encouraged to the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology .
&quot; in my opinion , it is so important that just as they can control the physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; if I take it seriously , then that they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who apply a permit or not . and this means a twi@@ sted system to monitor the activities of the people and also to bring them to a judicial process . &quot;
this is by no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the legislative Parliament and the Constitu@@ tional committees before it goes into the plenary session . &quot;
&quot; whether its acceptance and enforcement will succeed , or not , the draft is maxim@@ ised in line with a pro @-@ military thinking in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ised and ensured that no devi@@ ating Nar@@ ration on the surface is present , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , the parliam@@ ent@@ sia of Tam@@ er El @-@ Sh@@ ah@@ aw@@ y proposed a legislation on cy@@ ber crime against cy@@ ber crime , which was fores@@ een to thre@@ aten the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; &quot; protest by protest . &quot;

high up in the mountains of Kur@@ dist@@ an in the north @-@ east of the Ir@@ aks work the Zodi@@ ac@@ er H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and her team of scientists of the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq to protect the spirit@@ ually Persian leop@@ ards .
&quot; a sub@@ type of the larger family of Leop@@ ards , who through Africa and Asia belong to the Persian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . overall , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are always found less boot@@ y due to Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and the frag@@ mentation of its habitat , and since they are getting less pre@@ y . &quot;
why is this certain kind of leop@@ ards so important ?
&quot; as R@@ aza in the video shows , &quot; the Persian Leopard the only remaining car@@ b@@ tier in the Kur@@ dish ecos@@ ystem &quot; and the health and the thr@@ ac@@ ement of the ecos@@ ystem also depends on that a big cat@@ er@@ tier exists . &quot;
&quot; the chance to see a Persian leop@@ ards actually in the free wilderness , is small and goes against zero . when the team in the video is therefore festive that they have a shot of a great cat in the camera , breaks R@@ aza in pure pleasure . &quot;
as a trained Bi@@ olog@@ in shows R@@ aza passi@@ on@@ ately like another side of their country that is not just war and conflict .
it has been involved in field studies for wild studies to wild animals and involved in the education programmes of Nature Iraq .
it has been a member of IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and is committed to that protected areas for wild animals in the Kur@@ dist@@ an region .

&quot; at the beginning of March 2017 documented , the adv@@ ancing for the north of Japan , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o , the progress made in the last six years were affected by the &quot; &quot; Trinity &quot; &quot; of March 2011 . a tremendous earthquake , an ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a had triggered the disaster . &quot;
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung has its headquarters in Sen@@ da@@ i that is located in the pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . the pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was an important pre@@ fec@@ tures in Japan @-@ northeast that both experience the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
&quot; hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighborhoods of Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a and Iv@@ ano were forced to evac@@ u@@ ated , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had disappear whole coastal cities of the map . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a lived in an atomic accident , already alone , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses . &quot;
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o shows the progress made six years later in order to re @-@ establish the life of local resident .
the detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics of the Japanese recy@@ cle authority as well as survey results of those concerned themselves .
&quot; housing in Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and Iv@@ ate &quot;
&quot; K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned spare parts ( most of us is , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were finished in the Pre@@ fec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and Iw@@ ate . &quot;
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to draw the greatest success under the three Pre@@ fec@@ tures Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , here 80 percent of the planned replacement buildings were completed . &quot;
&quot; Iw@@ ate has finished 75 per cent of such houses , while Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a is with 70 percent of the final light . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , one still stri@@ ves , even six years after the catastrophe , evac@@ u@@ ated of pleas@@ ures ( Bec@@ ause it is , kas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in final replacement units . &quot;
&quot; after the triple catastrophe , nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in living accommodations . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 , 36 000 people lived from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a and Iw@@ ate in such cases . &quot;
&quot; almost 40 percent of the year 2011 evac@@ u@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a still live in emergency accommodations , while mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 per cent of the evac@@ uation were sl@@ ed after the disaster , were settled in final houses . &quot;
for Iw@@ ate the number is here at 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ fec@@ tures
&quot; how the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper was able to determine 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , which were affected by the disaster , their doors up to December 2016 , which makes almost 98 per cent of the schools of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; six years later , industrial reconstruction in the three Pre@@ fec@@ tures is much more difficult . &quot;
&quot; during almost 100 percent of the fisher@@ ports in Iw@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i have now been operating in Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a , only 30 per cent of the fisher@@ ties in their operations . &quot;
&quot; the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atomic accident , have moved large @-@ scale in the three Pre@@ fec@@ tures of agr@@ land . &quot;
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas with only 66 percent of the agricultural land in Iw@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed A@@ cker@@ him@@ a in Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a .
&quot; it is unlikely that this is just a consequence of the atomic fact , because only 690 acres of 5 400 hectares of destroyed field of Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a , are located in the &quot; nuclear zone &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures , tourism still recovered again , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a remains far down . &quot;
&quot; the tourist resi@@ dences in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and Iw@@ ate are back to 90 percent in the same stand as before the un@@ happiness . Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a , however , can be found here only 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it has become more difficult to earn their livel@@ ih@@ ood . &quot;
is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
&quot; to obtain an overall picture , the newspaper conducted numerous surveys among the native people and among the evac@@ u@@ ated by . she asked her about the state of re@@ building and also how their rebel@@ lion against the ts@@ un@@ ami risk changed . &quot;
in its introduction of the article the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Newspaper explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o led a survey in order to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the native people .
&quot; the survey conducted that 8@@ 3.1 percent of the resident resident , measures have taken to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is . &quot;
&quot; however , 55.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents are still not done enough in terms of disasters prevention . &quot;
as it stands for those who had to evac@@ u@@ ated from the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a
&quot; in their output for the anniversary of the earthquake , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper its attention is also focused on the position of the evac@@ uation of Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a had to experience not only the tremendous earthquake and the devast@@ ating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a was also a witness to the worst , dis@@ astro@@ us caused , atomic accident , the Japan ever had to experience . &quot;
&quot; from 160 000 evac@@ uation of Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a , almost 63 000 people were lost in areas outside the pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 a little more than 23 000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a , were converted into permanent spare parts . &quot;
&quot; after the status of 2017 , there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a outside their home pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; in the disaster areas , most of the evac@@ u@@ ties are still alive as 50 years old . they have to compete with massive construction projects , taking advantage of efforts to rebuild Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Iw@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a with massive construction projects . this is a part of the Olympic Games that are part of the Olympic Games in Tokyo . &quot;
the world is small : our Pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep
&quot; when one encounter people from other countries , the differences appear to be a different language , the differences appear to be larger than the simil@@ arities . &quot;
&quot; after a while , however , one recogni@@ zes that a more connected than it seems at first glance . &quot;
&quot; these global links are important , since they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world eventually is very small . &quot;
&quot; in this sequence of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look at exactly this global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we treat themes that often get less attention in the coverage than they deserve . &quot;
we speak to five Global Vo@@ ices who remember to a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone over voice and country borders .

&quot; a Brazilian student at the age of 33 years ago , this week was delivered into the Inten@@ sive station : last Friday he had taken a police during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with a stroke in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with a stroke against the head . nationwide millions of demonstr@@ ators held on a protest against austerity . &quot;
&quot; Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , the social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a sk@@ ull @-@ brain trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures . &quot;
doctors performed him this Saturday and have now put it into an artificial dres@@ a .
his condition is considered critical .
the local portrait of Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , moving within a few days fast in Brazil . &quot;
&quot; in pictures this is also the face of the police be@@ am@@ ten , which is identified with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o . &quot;
&quot; after the incident , the military police force in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás , that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until completion of the examination of the incident of the active service . &quot;
the pictures show the police be@@ am@@ ten as he enters into Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his impact on the face of the students Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( Photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
&quot; would have been a police be@@ am@@ ter of a prot@@ esters and land on the Inten@@ sive station , his face would be six months long on TV and the entire oppression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a press @-@ channel of media @-@ activi@@ sts from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , told the video on the net in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police and several sanitary blocks just to him . &quot;
&quot; another video with the same scenes , but from a different perspective is also found in social networks . &quot;
in the shown clip one sees the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another federal state , we have donated 10,000 Brazi@@ li@@ ans ( about 2,@@ 700 euro ) to cover a part of the cost of medical treatment and to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while he is in hospital . &quot;

police over@@ gri@@ ps
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil in which it came to brutal police measures against prot@@ esters .
&quot; polic@@ emen put in protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had established a stage for speakers , Rub@@ ber and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the MP Fl@@ avi@@ o Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police via loud@@ speaker of violence against prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the whole country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media street protests per@@ su@@ es by putting the focus on another , unexpected prot@@ agon@@ ists : a window @-@ screen . &quot;
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported above a zer@@ bro@@ chen@@ es glass pane to make it possible with a photo of their title illustr@@ ative .
against it preferred the O Glo@@ bo a title story with a set @-@ set bus .
&quot; there is no pl@@ au@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a broken window than about the protests of thousands of people who serve the defence of a special thing . &quot;
&quot; this must also recognise , if you are strictly against any form of damage . &quot;
&quot; here also the term &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; is given an absurd , dis@@ proportion@@ ate significance , and the typical violence rates of the military police are created by head@@ lines with the title &quot; prot@@ esters at con@@ front con@@ front with the police &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the villages of the un@@ in@@ duc@@ ers forgotten villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ var@@ o Re@@ yn@@ oso closed almost hundreds of sugar en@@ closures in the whole of Cuba the doors ( Photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the People &apos;s Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ i , which is located in the western Cub@@ an province of May@@ abe@@ que , is widely known as el Central - to Spanish sugar@@ be@@ que - regardless of that there is no fault @-@ able sugars on site . &quot;
it is two years ago when the activities were put in the sugar @-@ fabri@@ cated factories .
&quot; after the ext@@ ents , the Sug@@ ar Cro@@ w@@ rists in the region stood still , and the factory lost after and after its installations , until only the ru@@ m@@ st of steel and concrete remained . &quot;
approximately 272 workers had to re@@ locate themselves .
some changes rarely the work .
&quot; other signed and comm@@ uting a day to the factories , which even ma@@ hlen . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , every day at 4 : 00 am rising , the crisis in the sugar @-@ tube scre@@ wed not his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that in the East of the region of Sug@@ ar Cro@@ ws , which are in operation after a long in@@ active time , because they were preserved . &quot;
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene reminds us exactly that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich would get the sugar @-@ scr@@ aper factory but the promise has not been kept .
&quot; the sugar @-@ industry was already resistance to the case of socialism , the case of socialism , low market prices , the in@@ efficiency , the bad management decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , the production 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the 1910 producer . &quot;
&quot; the message would have been a motive for the country a few decades ago , but the bad appointments are already no re@@ alism . &quot;
why has the Cub@@ an immigration industry was switched off ?
the old railway lines of the community looked for better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the reduction of the sugar can@@ e industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sweets fabri@@ cated fabri@@ cation were technically obsol@@ ete , and hardly competitive , they were unnecessary for the country . &quot;
the initial idea was to concentrate on the efficient production of the most efficient factories that amoun@@ ted to 4 million tons .
&quot; they only left the factories , which can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0,@@ 03 Euro ) . &quot;
the solution for unemployment ?
&quot; the motives that resulted in such measures were the low productivity of sugar farms , and the sugar crisis on the world market . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar @-@ price increased about a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 2025 the price of un@@ refined sugar has to stay between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 report &quot; &quot; agricultural perspectives &quot; &quot; from the OECD and the FAO , the agricultural and food organisation of the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; if the current production of 2001 would achieve the level of 2001 ( 3,@@ 6 million tonnes ) , the Roh@@ zu@@ cker export is roughly 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day will come into history with certainty for the first words of the Cub@@ an President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
&quot; from there , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began . &quot;
&quot; in the following years , the l@@ ac@@ tation of a total of 98 sugars factories , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further training . &quot;
the same happened in the Sug@@ ar Cro@@ w@@ fabrik Greg@@ orio Arl@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich am 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; if N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , about the closure of the factory , is the Word , which he is repeated in most . &quot;
nearly all respon@@ dents are the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
so that the place is preserved they formed a full @-@ time - working group .
&quot; before the first year , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; it was officially recognised documents that would be removed only on the parts , which would be removed , the address sat and the date differ@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister was able to see any det@@ ention . &quot;
&quot; from there , the responsibility over and the letters have become more and more frequent . &quot;
&quot; Juan Carlos River@@ o was in charge for two years for the still@@ ed factory , and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the still in operation . &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for the retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was against his will in the l@@ ac@@ tation of the factory , at whose construction he helped him . &quot;
&quot; with each part he removed , dismant@@ led one of his 31 working years . &quot;
the newly developed industrial area developed by Cuba and the most important workplace producers has been eliminated .
&quot; in many cases , no alternatives for working places and services were generated , which were generated in the municipalities in which they found themselves . &quot;
&quot; we will never know if during the Mam@@ mut speech given 21 October 2002 , the dam@@ ten president in the eyes of the present people saw , as he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories had no longer run in operation for five years . &quot;
the price of the population for the closing of sugar pipes
&quot; since 2004 , sugar is extr@@ acted only high by bl@@ asting . &quot;

&quot; after two years , the People &apos;s community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ i , that many things have changed , but not always for the better if a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; as the Sug@@ ar Cro@@ w@@ fabrik closed , or better said than they began to dism@@ is@@ itate them , they also listened to the road to asp@@ hal@@ ting it as well as other farms . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look up other factories . &quot;
they were to be found to spare parts .
&quot; without future @-@ perspective , many young people left the region even so many young people . &quot;
&quot; in the area , a food factory was created , whose production serves not even for the supply of the community . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impos@@ ing .
&quot; at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene went back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began working . &quot;

first Nations young people use Hip Hop to express their own culture and get their own culture
record of a song from &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ ape Nar@@ rows First Nation .

&quot; young people from the First Nations communities across Canada deal with themes that are important for them . they do with Hip Hop , thanks to a number of hiking workshops . &quot;
&quot; as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an @-@ tour bring mobile sound studios directly to schools and youth centers in order to accommodate Youth @-@ son@@ g@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live recording . &quot;
the original workshops were guided by the educ@@ ator David Ho@@ dges who lives in Montreal and in North @-@ Que@@ bec with ten C@@ ree communities and then worked with the C@@ ree Hip @-@ hop @-@ Group The North@@ stars .
&quot; the workshop is thus increasing that young participants in talks like &quot; cultural identity , language , confrontation , love , self @-@ unacceptable &quot; or what they are always found in mind . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos where young people are the main actors .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team worked with other First Nations Communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winn@@ eb@@ ago in the U.S. state Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ yo@@ o tells in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ chen@@ cally First nation in British Columbia , for example , the history of the Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; in which almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or mur@@ dered . &quot;
the cases were largely unknown .
&quot; the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka C@@ ree First nation uses the mot@@ if of a video player to convey how important to preserve traditional customs and customs , despite the influences of globalization . &quot;
&quot; many of the songs were published in Indi@@ genous languages , although the young people of the First Nations are not always bo@@ unded . &quot;
&quot; in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i C@@ ree First Nation have taken , the ref@@ rain is sung on C@@ ree . &quot;
the young people involved were given some help from Gary Jol@@ ly from the North@@ stars Hip @-@ hop group who gave them a st@@ rop@@ he in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay C@@ ree .
&quot; on the Fac@@ ebook@@ page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , the St@@ rop@@ he is available in tran@@ script , as well as a translation into English , which is translated here into German . &quot;
sometimes I feel than would not ever be interested in me
but I try to go on my days on earth
that is the day where you will take our cry
because we as youth have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will rise up one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad living
this is how they can grow and take advantage of our youth
this is how they can do that which has been the Creator for them
the commentary on the reader and supporters of the C@@ ree @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also has a post and adds the st@@ rop@@ he in Sil@@ ben@@ au ( which is also published on his blog and will be re@@ published here with permission ) :
plastic meals will not only be shown in the restaurant
plastic meals ( most of us today ) outside of a typical restaurant in Japan .

in Japan one can see almost every restaurant plas@@ tical dishes .
&quot; to show potential customers , what exactly is on the menu is located close to the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( Bec@@ ause it is , &quot; &quot; plastic models of the dishes &quot; ) of every speakers , which is served in this restaurant . &quot;
the customers see these plastic labels and then decide whether to enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic labels .
in the Tok@@ i@@ oter district Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi there are a variety of these small businesses that produce the plastic fil@@ mm@@ akers W@@ im Wen@@ ders in his movie Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
&quot; for most of Japan these plastic meals are so usually that they do not even exceed them all . a new trend turns it into ob@@ tr@@ usive cell accessories and other gad@@ gets . &quot;
at N@@ aver Mat@@ ome published the B@@ log@@ ger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos that show this unusual tw@@ ist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ u .
&quot; now in special sale : new with plastic @-@ established mobile phones , as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu Kauf@@ haus . &quot;
&quot; many of these artificial foods were turned to kit@@ ten collective items , as in this case , cooling cabinet magnets : &quot;
here are a few sho@@ ku@@ cks cooler for a new exhibition at Tokyo @-@ Station .
the new boom of Essen@@ ti@@ fications is increasingly becoming a def@@ ender .
in this case a ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular travel line with seafood ) turned into a cell stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as mobile phone .
also this part we have made for the exhibition in Tokyo .
and here is an apple that your mobile phone rings :
&quot; designed to watch like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and that is only the beginning of an increasing attraction .
&quot; some mobile phones and mobile designers allow you to manufacture your own artwork . in this case , ik@@ ura or Sal@@ mon uses a popular T@@ opp@@ ings , which is served with white rice . &quot;
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; is there someone who would say : &quot; Wow , cool , now I can che@@ ating my mobile phone with salmon ? . &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
&quot; this interest in plastic Surgery may also take a less appe@@ tizing form , to surprise for example colleagues or family members unpleasant . &quot;
our latest mobile phone stands has the form of mel@@ ting the ice .
&quot; in addition , there are also travel balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , ear@@ rings and hand@@ y@@ bands out of dried salmon . &quot;
other sk@@ ur@@ r@@ ile plastic labels can be seen at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s N@@ aver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # Three Bec@@ ause it &apos;s
&quot; if you would like to know more about the origin of this trend , then this video gives you an insight into the town of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry . like for example , with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic labels are actually produced .
a mex@@ ican project tells the stories of the survi@@ vor@@ s of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the struggle against drug dealers .

in reports of in@@ - and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; fight against Dru@@ gs &quot; in Mexico the missing and rel@@ ayed regularly only in statistics . however , they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy against this struggle . &quot;
&quot; the reporting on drug bos@@ ses like El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the boss of Sin@@ alo@@ a @-@ Kart@@ ell , the story of the victims of the conflict totally in the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looking at the trau@@ ma or to the municipalities that have learned to live with pain . &quot;
&quot; here are behind every body , behind any bone funds in the hundreds of married tom@@ bs , the stories of zah@@ ll@@ os@@ er parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners who might never heal their w@@ ounds . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vivi@@ r C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; with drug trading &quot; ) . &quot;
Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project so :
organised crime makes us not just fear our lives .
the effects are far profound .
&quot; for example , if business close , because they are threatened by drug retailers and all congreg@@ ations have to drive many kilometres to buy something like milk . &quot;
the pain of the victims
a video with the title &quot; vi@@ das que c@@ ambi@@ an p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; as fear life changed &quot; ) just tells these stories .
&quot; a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who died every weekend out of the tom@@ bs after his son . &quot;
&quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost their four brothers , their four brothers , her husband and two of their ne@@ ph@@ ew . &quot;
&quot; priests : &quot; like every Sunday we prepare ourselves today again to the task that we have put forward to get rid of and after tom@@ bs , according to the people who we loved to seek . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Contr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Contr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
&quot; he was 28 , when he disappeared . &quot;
he has three children .
he worked in an e @-@ business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on October 13th he left the house .
&quot; on 15 October he should be back again , but he never came again . Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it is very hard for me , for I am alone with three children who need a training . &quot;
there is also my mother that is also here with me .
at the moment it has no income .
&quot; you are the insurance of my Father , but that does not get them out , because they require a ster@@ n@@ ation . &quot;
where should we get it ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are of fear . we need to show the international community the conflicts , the dis@@ ruption and government management . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ HB , a les@@ bian by Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from tax@@ co , in the federal state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central mex@@ iko . &quot;
&quot; your contribution reminds us that one should never consider violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs : &quot;
I have been reading disease and sens@@ ational journ@@ alism for several years now .
&quot; I am passing every day at contemporary ki@@ os@@ ks and see the front pages with pictures , which actually only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or out of specialists . &quot;
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the one who is wi@@ ped or sad . it works as a lack of respect for the person who once belon@@ ged to the body .
I cannot be ou@@ tw@@ ined or consider this as normal .
you write on :
&quot; no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year old C@@ ous@@ in thinks that he is fo@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) will be , when he is great . and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; &quot; hero@@ ine &quot; &quot; of criminal case when they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me , this is as if they hear ones who have lost someone and those who have fear that they have happened so something . &quot;
I see our weakness when stories to mere numbers are in a statisti@@ c .
&quot; the in@@ el@@ essness of men is incredible for me , when the death of six people and the dis@@ appearances of 43 students were justified in a neigh@@ bor that they were wo@@ unded . &quot;
I think they try to speak that they are spar@@ ed by such trag@@ e@@ dies if they are not stir@@ ring and silent .
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico @-@ town wrote the post &quot; Four months of ext@@ or@@ tion in the main town of capital : like a family of dru@@ g@@ ations below , until they were destroyed at the end of not only the business , but also their families apart . &quot;
you think of everything you have lost and remember how many people can change your whole life in just a few days .
&quot; it never ends that trau@@ ma remains , the fear is coming back up when you are alone . &quot;
habits have changed , telephone numbers too . &quot;
we just contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the further we are removed from each other , the better . &quot;
you made a report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , because you do not know when they will lead you or kill you . &quot;
&quot; I asked myself in these horri@@ ble days wonder@@ ing if I would solve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answers is no , because I forgot how you we@@ pt . I have to learn to live with pain . &quot;
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : one of violence led by violence . &quot;
&quot; in the introduction he raises questions on how , who takes care of the child of a mixed woman and a man who were mur@@ dered by organised crime ? &quot;
how is it to grow up in a settlement on the edge of the most vulnerable city of Mex@@ ic@@ os ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of them . &quot;
Br@@ yan is a washing and he tells you had to teach yourself how to warm a egg coo@@ p , potatoes , tor@@ till@@ as warm and &apos; Chi@@ chi &apos; for the babies which are with him . this is his name for the preparation of the fl@@ ap with water , sugar and milk pul@@ ses . &quot;
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year .
but they are un@@ important compared to the pain in his eyes - speaking for a boy for the whole life of violence and learning to learn to live .
&quot; when he was five years old , one told him that his mother disappeared . &quot;
but that was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood has been past two years ago , when he was just a few blocks away from his home , the bloo@@ dy corp@@ se of his Father had been shot by armed men from a passing by car . &quot;
&quot; when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this : &quot;
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 as violence through organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez the most vulnerable city in the world due to the number of murder for public safety and government of the United States .
in 2010 alone the State of the Prosec@@ ut@@ or 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to the cut 8.5 Mor@@ den per day .
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave organised crime in Mexico and penet@@ rate into the soul of the country .
only a few stories still live in view of new head@@ lines . this project reminds us of those that we should not forget .
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vivi@@ r C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data in life , whose objective is to show the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trading , who has tor@@ mented the country in the last four decades , in a compreh@@ en@@ sible manner . &quot;
when a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Flick@@ r @-@ Users Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this post and the pages , to which he linked , contain images , on which violence is represented . &quot;
&quot; the fact check is important in a moment , in which it is about to lift up a straight@@ for@@ age or de@@ du@@ ce a for@@ gery . &quot;
&quot; but how is the years after something the first time has sur@@ faced ? content in social media , whether true or void , ten@@ ds to continue . &quot;
&quot; today , we take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) . &quot;
&quot; since its first publication , it was not used mis@@ leading , trag@@ e@@ dies that actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this false p@@ airing between image and event - &quot; false descriptions &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dr@@ aft News - deny the fact that there was ample reporting of events in the DR of Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but I ask questions about our desire for pictures to messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a tan@@ ker wag@@ ons the place S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , ki@@ pp@@ te around and explo@@ ded . they came to 230 people . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war of Africa the second largest country had been negl@@ ected and scr@@ apped . the streets in the region have become a dangerous paths full of stroke , which was difficult to sail . &quot;
&quot; typically , it was the victim of the petrol trucks . &quot;
&quot; govern@@ ors described a fire@@ ball , the frag@@ mentary houses including a cinema in the proximity , which was full of people who was full of the World Cup . &quot;
houses se@@ ated and shortened bodies in the streets scattered .
many people were burned to the uncertainty .
a picture with the title &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ users My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 . January 2015 multiple photos of the incident form the gray scene of this day . &quot;
above is an example of this .
it displays rows of shortened body that are mounted on the floor while people are looking at it .
but here the story does not find its end .
&quot; over the years , the same photo was written by several times on social media , blogs and other platforms and consequently , real but not related to the related trag@@ e@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what happened to Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 attacked fighters of B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ am the Nig@@ eri@@ an Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of B@@ aga and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
eye @-@ witnesses reported dr@@ as@@ tically from atro@@ cities before whom they had to escape .
houses and shops were burned down and corp@@ ses are in streets and bus@@ hes .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; however , the numbers could not be confirmed but no one remained back to count corp@@ ses , &quot; said a citizen to Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many were broken , shot or burned . &quot;
only with the satellite image the subsequent time could be pic@@ tured .
&quot; the reason for the attack remained un@@ solved , but the army prot@@ ector in B@@ aga was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt to win B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ am , land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
&quot; and here the picture from the DR of Congo appeared again , when it was mis@@ diagnosed as evidence of the fact and the potential extent of the attack . &quot;
this is Nigeria .
a mass@@ ac@@ re of 2.000 people took place two days after Paris .
you are not Charlie .
you are dead .
&quot; in fact , this ab@@ usive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of fail@@ ures ; Africa check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
in all these cases the image was presented as a cover for mass@@ aging .
&quot; yet another step further bring personal comments such as this example , the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to deliver arguments . &quot;
the picture from S@@ ange joined together with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a flash agreement , published by the United Nations described those who fle@@ e bats , r@@ ape and et@@ ened T@@ ote , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported from violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts , as the following , which these descriptions are summar@@ ized with photos from the DR of Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture comes from a sau@@ di @-@ Arab news , which in 2012 , the President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ ein Being had said , mon@@ ks and politicians would have participated in the ass@@ ass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslim . in addition , it had used the picture from the DR Congo to find this information . &quot;
&quot; the original contribution , which was last accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be inv@@ oked here . &quot;
&quot; other news organizations , the AF@@ P as their source , had also fal@@ si@@ ly de@@ ed Th@@ ein being written this statement , but had not associated with the picture from the DR Congo . &quot;
the worldwide range of false information
traces of this false coupling will be back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; using a &quot; reverse image &quot; , &quot; you can see how far information is possible to cross . &quot;
a changing picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 325 images under 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( status of 3 May 2017 ) 344 images that are very similar to the ma@@ instream image from the DR Congo .
&quot; they come from a mixed lot of private pages , platforms social media and community , as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
some have passed wrong reports but have tried other attempts to de@@ lar@@ ged the counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing .
&quot; we have given examples for the ab@@ usive usage , and associated with the respective countries , based on which page they had been published . thus we want to be more clearly defined than by the language alone . &quot;
from the countries listed below ( which were also associated with each other ) several examples of ab@@ usive use .
some cases that can now be fully split completely ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News Fr@@ ames .
examples of country examples from wrong cou@@ plings of the image from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
&quot; the or@@ derly countries point out on pages or servers , through the examples of counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing or fal@@ seh@@ oods are still available . &quot;
&quot; the countries in Gra@@ y are examples that are also available according to metad@@ ata and information , which are available via Tin@@ Eye . &quot;
&quot; reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;
&quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( directed at Alger@@ ian and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread as to the &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot;

&quot; in this post a b@@ log@@ ger from Que@@ bec City is not only disc@@ usses the fal@@ con , but disc@@ usses the abuse of the picture from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria as well as further questions about the intentions of the people and the wr@@ apped trag@@ e@@ dies ( in the DR Congo and beyond ) . &quot;

&quot; Iran , 2012 . &quot;
an association of students of the@@ ology ( Mul@@ l@@ ahs ) in Islamic countries published an open letter for the support of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims on the news of the N@@ asi@@ m Agency and used to illustrate the picture of the DR Congo .

&quot; Malaysia , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Malaysia offers two extreme example of an ab@@ usive use of the picture from the DR Congo , with one on the one hand caused by a we@@ et , the sympathy towards the Nig@@ eri@@ an mass@@ akers , and on the other hand the attempt of a log@@ gers , the declar@@ ations , the Roh@@ ing@@ ya are persec@@ uted , since the photos of it ab@@ usive . &quot;
Myanmar , 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the Government of Myanmar released a jud@@ gement on what they said as &quot; clearly fin@@ alized news and photos , international media , international human rights organizations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ under@@ standings with Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this regulation that appeared exclusively in English , includes references to counter@@ f@@ eit images of sc@@ ams , who operate H@@ ate Speech and used by extrem@@ ist groups to set out that Muslims kill and ander@@ sr@@ l ( which is often spread by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) . &quot;

&quot; this post , which directed to the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , clearly shows that the picture of the DR Congo will NOT see Muslims , kill the Christians . &quot;
&quot; Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 . &quot;
this message was mis@@ understood that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein Being in 2012 have been involved that mon@@ ks and politicians have participated in the killing of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and is currently included in this publication .
&quot; Spain , 2015 / 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this article by 2014 about students who had been brought about by the B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ am , published by the B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ im of An@@ ál@@ is@@ is Digital , has expressly declar@@ es that the picture is not of the killing , but it claims that it had a &quot; similar ji@@ ha@@ di@@ stic attack . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when the picture was later raised in connection with the mass@@ ac@@ re of B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ am by 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to res@@ ist that there were connections to Nigeria . &quot;
Turkey . 2015 . &quot; # Nij@@ er@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ fer@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ uy &quot; ( Nigeria bur@@ ns the world as@@ leep ) .
&quot; the picture of the DR Congo , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and rede@@ emed a discussion among Muslims according to the mass@@ ac@@ re of B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ on 2015 and the following on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to achieve that their communities found these events , the mut@@ u@@ ously in the name of Islam , a greater attention . &quot;
United States / 2015 .
the picture was we@@ ather@@ ed as a cover for the mass@@ ac@@ re of the B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 Male ret@@ we@@ et@@ et ) . but the messages that were associated with them were raised in no religious context .
&quot; instead , the aim was to focus attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media @-@ reporting compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
Vietnam ( ese ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message , which alleg@@ edly been written by a &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mart@@ os &quot; over the Nig@@ eri@@ an mass@@ ac@@ re , took the discussion as this here on Vietnamese and explained it to fal@@ con . &quot;
&quot; from the message , in which the picture from the DR Congo was included , distance the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ ine Mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mart@@ os . &quot;
&quot; there are further confirmed examples of an faul@@ ty use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the cap in grey ) , ink Eye also hin , are no more entirely trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
( data entry with URLs and time stamps exist on the web site and sc@@ oring them via image file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
&quot; in all these cases , that only appeared clearly after the original un@@ glaz@@ ing of 2010 , the picture finally carries a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or appro@@ ach@@ able . &quot;
frames and pictures
there are two strong themes or frames ( inser@@ tions ) which pul@@ ling this po@@ sts . the first frame focused on religion .
the photo was used in terms of greater discussions about the silence in connection with the surveys of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the spec@@ tions of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as through Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second Fr@@ aming is used to discuss how a African life is evaluated in comparison to a European or French life .
religion is wanting to understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worth to investigate as images are used in connection with these efforts .
&quot; however , a deeper question is what happens if readers cannot give this pictures longer . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are fifty people , the un@@ int@@ enti@@ onal share that water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; suggest this mood of faul@@ t@@ - and fal@@ seh@@ ood , that actual atro@@ cities were un@@ true and dirty it the real Gre@@ ys of what actually happened in the DR of Congo , in Nigeria and in Myanmar ? &quot;
the spread rap@@ ts@@ amer images has already been published in detail ( here for example ) .
&quot; an argument is that the with@@ hold of pictures of a ordination is equal to recognize the tragedy . sometimes , these pictures are even demanded by the victims itself . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the concern is that non @-@ violent pictures readers and spect@@ ators do des@@ ensi@@ vely take the ability to emp@@ athy ( such as this study , who studied how violent media work on it to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot to discuss things in the news media , the fact that it is indispensable for today &apos;s message . &quot;
&quot; T@@ echn@@ ologists experiment with algorithms to assist the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; . they will be thoroughly suggest about situation in which an image is suggested slightly , but actually dis@@ solved by context or on completely ab@@ usive type . &quot;
any investigation of false subsi@@ dies should also take account of how international they can be .

&quot; a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. D@@ t. uns@@ atis@@ able ) makes every effort to offer voice enthusiastic a selection of words from around the world , which are difficult or not to be translated at all . &quot;
such words are available in every language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
&quot; some of these uns@@ ur@@ able words are already well known ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) , and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ m@@ esa ) . &quot;
but everyone is stub@@ born stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt to a simple translation .
&quot; a word or expression is not enough , why a full explanation and sometimes some context are necessary to understand exactly what is meant by that one word . &quot;
these unique words were already collected for a whole time in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist from &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird chose to concentrate on small languages . &quot;
&quot; in the blog you can find for example words from the VAT language of V@@ anu@@ at@@ u , as : &quot;
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - greet you for your parents in recognition of how to strive for you in your younger years .
words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language which are spoken in parts of Brazil like :
k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The convenience or la@@ zin@@ ess that you feel after enjoying on cold days in the sun .
in Bir@@ ds own words from his blog About :
&quot; they s@@ ander from other cultures , un@@ vei@@ led other thought and ar@@ ouse our novel@@ gi@@ er@@ de . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page you would like to publish more of this &quot; &quot; uns@@ ur@@ able &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are . &quot;
&quot; Red@@ ner of the &quot; Treasure Langu@@ ages &quot; , &quot; which are highly appreciated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able are invited to download their favorite words here . &quot;

use Author@@ ig@@ t@@ .D@@ am@@ as in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neigh@@ bor and love girlfriend .
&quot; I trust her my four year old daughter , they trust me their children ; she is my rock in the fire . &quot;
in the one minute we call for par@@ ols for the rights of women .
in the next sk@@ andi@@ zing we are rights for trans@@ gender .
&quot; we are located in a sea of rain@@ forests and people , some keep the icon@@ ic image of a woman with a tow@@ el high , tied from an American flag , other sk@@ andi@@ zing par@@ olen against Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend looks me and says : &quot; &quot; these things concern not you , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
&quot; people , with whom I work or people who have known me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar that they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built itself in their performance . &quot;
they kid@@ n@@ mis@@ led me .
there are 1.3 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practi@@ se our religion differently .
&quot; we identify with it to be a Muslim to different species , but somehow we will all be put into the same Muslim drawer . &quot;
&quot; this drawer is designed in our collective idea , so well designed that once Muslims , which as I do not fit there , de@@ mus@@ li@@ zed . &quot;
kid@@ n@@ apping will be mis@@ led
I am not alone with that .
&quot; this is even the po@@ et , whose poetry in America is best sold : Rum@@ i . &quot;
which images come for one in the meaning if you think of it ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; as J@@ al@@ alu@@ dd@@ in Rum@@ i , as I am now , he was a orthodo@@ x@@ er Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Koran and the Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the center of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the western idea , religion was clear@@ ed Rum@@ is , as well as the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
this delet@@ ing makes a large part of the history of 1.7 billion Muslims from this world .
&quot; another consists of the reduced images of Muslims , the Western books have been colon@@ ized since centuries . &quot;
this temp@@ ting language is determined by the dark man who should fear and the exotic woman who should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientists Edward S@@ aid cr@@ ashed the story behind these pictures in the 19@@ 70s .
but these pictures are also continuing today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to forgive her . &quot;
&quot; I have worked for thir@@ teen years in the news industry and I have seen how this powerful , faul@@ ty Nar@@ r@@ ative our news@@ f@@ eds domin@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; this Nar@@ rati@@ v over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed reality , which in the last three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the U.S. could not even choose its first female presidential elections . &quot;
&quot; this Nar@@ r@@ atic ten@@ ds to acknowledge that when French , Muslim women are prevented from doing their head @-@ tow@@ el in public buildings and sau@@ di @-@ Arabic , Muslim women through their government to cover their entire body that these are both sides of the same coin . &quot;
a powerful group is carrying out his &quot; control &quot; on the &quot; other . &quot;
&quot; this strong Nar@@ r@@ ally weak@@ ens Muslim women , the movements for change . &quot;
&quot; it also sees that the first Muslim prayers were spoken to American soil of Afri@@ kan@@ ers , which were brought together with slave @-@ ships . &quot;
it delet@@ es the existence of Que@@ er Muslims .
&quot; this Nar@@ r@@ v has our collective imagination , so deeply and lack@@ ed , that often Sik@@ h @-@ men and children become the aim of tim@@ esc@@ ort attacks and shafts . &quot;
&quot; due to these stories we tell and because of the nature we tell them is Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
to the 1.@@ 7 billion belong
&quot; in the news industry we do more than just stories to tell , which are based on facts . &quot;
or on alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ r@@ ative who help us understand the world .
and my industry has failed to grasp the Nar@@ rati@@ v of 1,@@ 7 billion . &quot;
and we have failed here to do seven million Muslims in the highest degree of &quot; different &quot; religious group in America .
more than one third of the whole Muslim people are African @-@ African Americans .
&quot; six of ten American Muslims belong to the immigration of the first generation , which origin@@ ate from 77 countries . &quot;

four decades ago my native parents came to live in New York to live her American dream .
&quot; my mother laid their first jewelry design on 5th Avenue before and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scrap@@ ers of New York , sky@@ scrap@@ ers , made by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan . &quot;
&quot; at that time , when Khan was re@@ touched by the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were un@@ avoi@@ dable Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I now un@@ inv@@ ented Muslim and American ?
&quot; sometimes , if people wonder why I don &apos;t say por@@ k , I say - instead of my Muslim recipes , or my hand @-@ out h@@ ash@@ an , who carry all Muslims with themselves - &quot; from respect for P@@ epp@@ a W@@ utz &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I sh@@ ze , we do not carry all T@@ ash@@ ch@@ or@@ ane with us . &quot;
&quot; we do not have to be the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; or to almost always be selected for additional safety checks at the airport . &quot;
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim schol@@ ars , Muslim activi@@ sts and inter@@ religious activi@@ sts who strive to fight widespread lies about Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced on the ongoing volume of a well lubric@@ ated Islam@@ ist machine with wall@@ ders , t@@ ink tanks and experts for counter@@ f@@ information which is our already faul@@ ty picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated manipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; due to the stories that we tell and due to the nature in which we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is in more than just a stran@@ ger who sub@@ mits a woman the tow@@ el . &quot;

I want to explain that .
&quot; I was born as Muslims , but a Muslim was born only then in my imagination , when I was four years old , in a pro@@ visional mosque in the basement of a prestigious church in New York . &quot;
&quot; social sciences constitutes a religious life , they attack on the following terms : faith , behavior and adher@@ ence . &quot;
my mus@@ li@@ ous faith and behavior might not always be visible but they are there .
&quot; perhaps my girlfriend would see my neighbour , my neighbour in the Brand@@ ing , that I am Muslims , when they might look through the 15 meters of concrete and air , which insepar@@ able our houses . &quot;
&quot; she would see the all@@ ab@@ end@@ ous ritual with my daughter when I found them into my arms , and her the Arab verses for the protection of sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding who defe@@ ated the Koran , and the Q@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
I repeat each of them three times .
&quot; so I know that they are protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my mus@@ li@@ ous faith is possibly not always visible , but my Muslim belonging is always part of my shadow . &quot;

use approved .
&quot; belonging to my grand@@ mother is the image of my grand@@ mother , with her sisters , how they can win a competition of the art of floral preparation in Kar@@ achi for decades . &quot;
&quot; it is the picture of her that I see at this moment , when I close my eyes : Nano , surrounded by its finished and un@@ finished painting of the painted Su@@ fi Shr@@ ine ; and one Kor@@ ans with many book@@ marks , a book with a hundred thousand chapters that can be nearly impossible . &quot;
&quot; Muslims means being to speak the prayers , which she had said to me when I have a bad day . &quot;
&quot; Muslims have to be , as she brought me to relate to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only master . &quot;
&quot; for a people that was established over centuries - by a &quot; Empire &quot; , &quot; which has established a company with the name of Ven@@ erable Bri@@ tic Ost@@ ini@@ dien @-@ Komp@@ anie , has it a deep meaning to name God to my only Lord . &quot;
the author in 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
&quot; belonging means to grow and listen that men don &apos;t w@@ ander , but at the same time to see that my dear grandfather cri@@ es . &quot;
&quot; sp@@ end@@ rin , while he writes books on modern Islam and about the independence Ka@@ sch@@ mir@@ s , we@@ pt N@@ ana Ja@@ an un@@ m@@ apped to his family owned by India , family that he was not allowed to close into his arms in a half century . &quot;
&quot; belonging is to know that there were millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families were , as with my grandfather , of col@@ oni@@ alists , who have dealt with the Muslim world as at the game . &quot;
&quot; Muslims , to be knowing that in the last two centuries Europeans all have appeared on four Muslim countries . &quot;
it means knowing that the first fly bom@@ b of history was rejected in front of a century about a Muslim country .
&quot; it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , an in@@ fashi@@ oned under@@ tan of the British empire , presented by the newspapers of his time as &quot; dangerous , &quot; since he led the first mosque in England . &quot;
&quot; before there were aircraft , he traveled into more parts of the world than I ever was and pre@@ ached the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;

&quot; to my Muslim tribe of the 1,@@ 7 billion people go back deep into our unforgettable family rooms ; our un@@ incorporated history . &quot;
&quot; it means to remember that four@@ teen years ago the most powerful military of the world , with troops , which have passed over every continent apart from the Ant@@ arc@@ tic , who have gone through Iraq to im@@ p weapons of weapons that were not existed . &quot;
it means knowing that more than half a million Ir@@ aker are buried in the tru@@ ths of the war .
an American Muslims means to know that the self @-@ mor@@ ality among Veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
&quot; it means to know that when a tragedy is seeking the US and carries the susp@@ ects a Muslim name , which tells the story four times more than a story with a white attack . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that four hundred years ago the first prayer @-@ call , the Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a liber@@ ated black slaves . &quot;
it means to know that two hundred years ago a African Islam@@ ist Islam@@ ist named Bil@@ ali Muhammad disc@@ kl@@ av@@ t and brought in this country .
it means Mal@@ col@@ m X name an American hero .
&quot; it is the warmth , which I read , as people have crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim B@@ an . &quot;
it is the hope that I feel when we stand for our dreams and when we count black lives .
&quot; to be an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ erin , a p@@ ah@@ ari , a Muslim and a journalist , represents a Muslim and a journalist , the in@@ dur@@ ated inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our with multi @-@ conn@@ ective identity , but to fail to communicate with others . &quot;
&quot; the Nar@@ r@@ v of 1,@@ 7 billion holds more possibilities than a mag@@ ici@@ als , but it is represented in the reduced branches &quot; we &quot; against &quot; it . &quot;
&quot; to be a mother means to take care of my child and all Muslim children , well @-@ knowing that power@@ fully and privileged people build on this two @-@ ness structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia has existed in the Muslim registr@@ ar , which started with President Bush and have been extended under President Obama . &quot;
it is in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
&quot; it consists of the immigration Minister , who takes a five year old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
&quot; it is in a country that closes its borders towards people from straight to the countries , which bom@@ bed it bombar@@ ded . &quot;
it is a false and neb@@ ul@@ ous &quot; No @-@ Fly @-@ list &quot; which largely uses Arabs and Muslims into the visor .
&quot; they are the wars , which we lead and the bom@@ bs , which we throw on Muslim countries . &quot;
&quot; due to the stories that we tell and due to those we do not tell , we are now here . &quot;
&quot; in a study with the title Asc@@ ent of Man , scientists presented the North@@ western University of participants a scienti@@ fically written picture and mis@@ ses them , groups on a scale of 1 to 100 with regard to evolution . &quot;
Muslims received the lowest score .
the constell@@ ations we have to lead
we have too deeply dar@@ ed to re@@ ze the Muslim or the &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; we are decades back to recognize the roots of our fears , and the faul@@ ty and dangerous image prints , which we fall into our news field . &quot;
&quot; at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , which tries to grasp our frequently used identi@@ ties and forget history . &quot;
&quot; the Pod@@ cast lake Some@@ thing , S@@ ay Some@@ thing from Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the vir@@ al video footage Secret Li@@ ves ; Schu@@ elo Square on black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ sters Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , American Super@@ hero@@ ine , mus@@ li@@ ous , American Super@@ hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope . &quot;

&quot; but I am worried about this difficult global issue , where we are in . &quot;
and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.3 billion .
&quot; there is one reason for that conspir@@ acy , which existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now the White House . &quot;
&quot; they have grown exp@@ on@@ ential , because they have made Muslims too . &quot;
&quot; there is another group that has grown exp@@ on@@ entially , by putting the &quot; others &quot; . &quot; &quot;
a few years ago it had not yet been given ; now they master great areas in Syria and Iraq .
&quot; I am worried about the realities and the history , which I was not aware of when I was so old now , as it is now my daughter , but who made me today to become a un@@ avoi@@ dable Muslim . &quot;
things I have left here like a bread@@ cru@@ m@@ ess in my speech .
&quot; things that might ar@@ ouse memories , because in all the interactions that makes our humanity a story , where someone is being made to another . &quot;
&quot; right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , you find con@@ quer in the course of the 8th annual conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; more than a hundred ac@@ ade@@ ker talk about our problems with the &quot; &quot; other &quot; , &quot; structural racism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot; &quot;
these are no terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us or read our newspapers in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; why do I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk ? in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who has shown us how wars will be guided and people through the appearance of the &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; in public perception , four decades ago . &quot;
&quot; we have to ask ourselves in@@ convenient questions according to the role of this , aware and un@@ aware the &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; ; just as it is my girlfriend and I have bombar@@ ded a new future in which we have no president , the Chocolate sl@@ ain , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1,@@ 7 billion . &quot;
it begins here with all of us .
initiative of Er@@ ror Art wants to maintain urban diversity
&quot; sk@@ ich@@ ten@@ ties , by Flick@@ r @-@ User Daniele Rossi , using the license CC BY @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 . &quot;
can there be one option to get in touch with someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Perry , founder of the Initiative Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) is the count of stories in their original language a possible response to it . &quot;
&quot; global Vo@@ ices reported in front of a different initiative of Steven Bird , the Un@@ translated blog . &quot;
&quot; however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written ones , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the variety of variety of cities . &quot;
&quot; in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia , or in O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already been carried out since 2015 events , the risk that small and not so small languages will not be passed on to the children . &quot;
for the creators of the project :
&quot; mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided if we assume towns to accept the diversity - secure spaces , in which inhabitants are not forgotten , who they are . &quot;
&quot; while listening is often associated to understand &quot; inform@@ ational these events instead &quot; &quot; listen to appreciate , to feel . &quot;
in this format cre@@ denti@@ als presented their story first in their own language and translate them in English .
&quot; even if the participants are not professional si@@ bl@@ ers , so carry their devotion and their representation that the list@@ ener can be included . &quot;
&quot; they call lau@@ gh and emotions , as the language is no longer a barrier . &quot;
&quot; the following video shows for example a traditional story of Burkina Fas@@ o , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the story t@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou is also the opportunity to explain for their land typical customs . &quot;
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the fas@@ cination of the rab@@ bit and the P@@ avian in the language Sh@@ ona from Zim@@ babwe :
&quot; after having declared the meaning of his banner , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked , &quot; how is that to speak to a public that does not understand your language ? &quot; with a broad ridge he shares his sense of inclusi@@ veness : &quot;
you have listened !
they were attentive ...
they were very happy with me !
&quot; so far the events of Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to expand this . all those who are inspired by the project , can arrange with T@@ LS , in order to organize their own events . &quot;

she was called by the group &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ u@@ da@@ dano p@@ or la Audit@@ or@@ ía de la D@@ eu@@ da &quot; ( Citiz@@ ens for the neur@@ et@@ re of debts ) and the Ö@@ kom@@ en@@ ian church in Puerto Ric@@ os .
the inter@@ c@@ essors of the new@@ com@@ bus@@ tion of debts have also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; the people of Puerto Ric@@ os calls for that politicians , ben@@ ches and government agencies responsible for debts are responsible for their corruption . &quot;
&quot; we call for a financial testing and a governance committee without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions and re@@ mun@@ eration , which acts in favour of the economy . &quot;
we become er@@ pres@@ st and supp@@ ressed .
&quot; the people of Puerto Ric@@ os refuse to pay a debt , which is not their . &quot;
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be deduc@@ ted with sin@@ king payments .
we require immediate action .
the island - not into the stat@@ eless territory of the USA - suffered under a serious financial crisis .
&quot; thus , the so @-@ called &quot; centre for New Economy , &quot; a ruling @-@ independent non @-@ profit organisation with focus on the socio @-@ economic development , a law for government responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state of state . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ric@@ os requires a wide restructuring of state infrastructure .
&quot; from outside also , measures will be raised without the participation and conviction of the citizen danger , be rejected from the people . &quot;
the demonstration carried the name &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot;

&quot; the sy@@ ri@@ cally @-@ Palestinian Web@@ developer Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , is missing for more than one year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives were continuing the campaign for his freedom and remind the contributions that he has made for an open grid . &quot;
&quot; at this year &apos;s re : Public@@ a , the annual conference on digital culture that will be held in Berlin , devoted an event to the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign . &quot;
&quot; Mé@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist in France resident CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , Commercial Manager released within three to five days , las@@ er@@ pts from the book C@@ ost of Freedom : a Coll@@ ective inquiry ( The cost of freedom : a collective research ) . &quot;
&quot; the book , published last year and here license is available , contains a number of attempts that deal with the free culture in the face of repression . &quot;
it is a hom@@ age to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it is said :
this book aims to discuss how movements are built for free knowledge and what the real costs are connected with which this is connected .
&quot; activi@@ sts , artist , designers , developers , researchers , researchers , developers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge , have worked on page to check over the fo@@ g , which surrounds our news@@ letters , and to create something different from our different experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to liber@@ ate Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celeb@@ rating Internet Volunte@@ ers , who has been held in Syria since 15 March 2012 . &quot;
his name was rep@@ ain@@ ted from the directory of the A@@ dra prison in which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
since then we have no information about its current state or place of residence .
&quot; the introductory part of his book with the title Coll@@ ective Memory gives his friends and family , who want to push for his release and want to know him back in his normal life and freedom . &quot;
&quot; to see how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have to begin to think about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , actions and decisions . &quot;
why are we here today ?
what did we decide ?
what have we given up extreme beliefs in this process ?
the Web@@ developer for Open Source and digital activities has been in the imprisonment of Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
&quot; in October 2015 Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution to be transferred to an unknown location . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and Ombud@@ sper@@ son N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; military police bass is based on a &quot; strictly secret &quot; &quot; command of the military court from his cell into A@@ dra . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi reported that they had been contacted by people on 12 November 2015 , who created himself as an insi@@ der @-@ Assad &apos;s government and put them in knowledge from an in@@ vigor@@ ous death part against her husband . &quot;
his place of place and state remain unknown .
&quot; a leader of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role to expand access to the internet and knowledge of the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , T@@ echnolog@@ ist and currently over the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project which founded Bass@@ el , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
perhaps none of Bas@@ que cultural prototypes are pres@@ cient as the work that he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ m@@ yr@@ as .
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites of the world , was the cross @-@ kreu@@ z of numerous civi@@ liz@@ ations and here , Greek @-@ ro@@ man architectural species with hi@@ esi@@ gen traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Bass@@ el could not know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would put it all that architecture that em@@ bo@@ died not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but of the world . &quot;
&quot; this strip is created in the digital archae@@ ology and preservation has created a contemporary music , which will be inv@@ alu@@ able for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future . &quot;
&quot; typically , Bass@@ el could not yet complete this project yet . &quot;
&quot; N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband , to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison : &quot;
&quot; I have spent my whole life with this , from freedom to dream and bass taught me to embrace her . &quot;
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
&quot; Bass@@ el brought me English , even when he was already in cu@@ sto@@ dy . &quot;
I learned to read English well and speak .
&quot; he always has his knowledge shared with each one who has asked . he has taught others , English to read and speak English . &quot;
&quot; Bass@@ el gave me the gate to the technology . he taught me , both computer and smartphones . &quot;
he brought me the internet .
&quot; he has brought the other we@@ ar@@ rests on how they use computers , at least theoretically , without that they actually kept one in their hands . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( War@@ ten ) who wrote in 2012 until 2015 to her husband than he was in cu@@ sto@@ dy .
Bass@@ el and N@@ oura have worked together on the book a year .
they tasted the lyrics to him when she visited him and he over@@ laid it from the Arabian into English .
the book is license @-@ free .
review of Y@@ ous@@ sef Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a entitled &quot; It is happening &quot; :
&quot; it happens during every visit , &quot;
&quot; that I fail in the world of your beautiful eyes , &quot;
that I lose the spi@@ der in the moment we embrace .
&quot; that any of the dangers , no matter is , &quot;
each of the f@@ ences which fet@@ ters and gu@@ ardi@@ ans
I forget the thr@@ ong of the prison
and I in every detail of your voice and words
which I drink with passion for me
if your eyes should say
and I will let another piece of my soul ...
&quot; I quickly go back to my lon@@ eliness , &quot;
to take all the moments to take back
and to smile over your absence .
I know myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the imprisonment of Bass@@ el wrote G@@ ha@@ zi :
a Year goes to my soul
during
&quot; I am in your c@@ age , &quot;
and you are still in the c@@ age of monsters
Bas@@ que story is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the beginning of the protests of 2011 against the regime Bas@@ har al @-@ Ass@@ ads , according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) more than 6@@ 5,000 people disappeared . &quot;
those who were arrested or caused by violence by the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
until 2016 we have died since 2011 according to the international human rights organization Am@@ nest@@ y International at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Sy@@ rer in H@@ aft .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
we reiter@@ ate our demand in hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Moz@@ ambi@@ que : because of corruption exp@@ elled Director after Haf@@ release again on the previous post .
Moz@@ ambi@@ que re@@ acted by anger for a corrupt fall under half of his sentence to the workplace in the state apparatus and the corruption has been committed .
&quot; this is the Di@@ o@@ dino Cam@@ ba@@ za , which was arrested in 2008 and ended in 2010 together with four other acc@@ used by 54 million meth@@ tik@@ al ( approximately 800 000 Euro ) to 22 years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the money st@@ amp@@ ed from public funds from the airports of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , the Council of Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released 2016 because of good management and immediately called his re@@ setting in the company what happened on 19 April then .
&quot; in accordance with a statement by the General Assembly of the Republic , which had the request out , there would be no barriers to Cam@@ ba@@ za once again its old post as the company was no discipl@@ in@@ ation after his cu@@ sto@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; however , many inhabitants take the action not good . &quot;
&quot; the Center for Public integrity ( Centro de Int@@ egri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution that advoc@@ ates for public transparency , distributed in an interview with the Deutsche Welle the decision of the company to re @-@ establish the director : &quot;
&quot; represents the lack of transparency in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the absence of transparency and is even a rel@@ apse in terms of the efforts of our legal system , so the C@@ IP . &quot;
what we need to take note is that the company should have a disciplines against the refu@@ ge .
&quot; however , the firm obviously appears and promp@@ ted not appropriate legal steps to apply the corresponding functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Mosai@@ c social media , rejected this behavior as well as regards the case as &quot; contradi@@ c@@ ant &quot; : &quot; &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ ba@@ za would be a competent type , he would be consultant after he was sentenced to a sentence and eat half of them . &quot;
&quot; he could hold numerous lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could provide advice and his image . &quot;
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he has been granted to be re@@ integrated into the company that he helped harm . &quot;
&quot; consequently , it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za will be happy to be paid for his silence . &quot;
contradi@@ c@@ tive !
&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Moz@@ ambi@@ que and Student of Political Science in Brazil says that the director has no mor@@ ality : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state because he pre@@ ached it , I can not believe that one has already been rewarded in such a way that the state has already become so massive . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za is missing from mor@@ ality to and to serve the state , * he had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead it is only served by the state itself . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state , as hand@@ ele it had become an in@@ exhaus@@ tible money source and the state itself , this man has become tired , which was loaded and finally do@@ omed to a long term . &quot;
&quot; honestly speaking , I do not know why this man was so rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te preferred to remember the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remind you that a th@@ ief is in prison : &quot;
&quot; th@@ iev@@ es belong to the prison of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el the Moz@@ ambi@@ kan@@ ers will not only be remembered as the first independent president , but also as a sharp , cutting and - next to the proph@@ etic speakers . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral depic@@ tions was , as he energetic , that &quot; a ambitious man is capable of all to be capable of being the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambitions , his own individual interest . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know whether an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that that is not so . he does change the tactics , but it does not apply from his ambitions . &quot;
a ambitious man is discrimin@@ ated at the same time . &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also possible :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison he sat 10 years old and came free .
&quot; and today he sets him the company , in which he money wor@@ shipped again , again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - я@@ ty ! ! ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) 12 May 2017
Em@@ ild@@ o Sam@@ bo from the magazine @ Ver@@ da@@ de ( too dt . : @ Truth ) presents that crime in Moz@@ ambi@@ que pays off :

&quot; Facebook blocked the rac@@ ist word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; in Myanmar and z@@ cen@@ sored many users to inj@@ ustice &quot;
the Bur@@ mes@@ an word &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; means K@@ ich@@ er@@ erb@@ se or sp@@ amm@@ se .

&quot; according to information from Facebook @-@ users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took its Po@@ sts from the net , because it enth@@ ouses the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although the origin of the word is still being discussed , it is usually used to refer to people ost@@ Indian origin , or generally used as ad@@ j@@ ectives . &quot;
&quot; Facebook z@@ ensi@@ vely the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; or is it done today ( in Bur@@ mes@@ an Scriptures ) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of the Hass@@ an in Burma in the social network . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely valuable con@@ notation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by Ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as Hass@@ le against Muslims , which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in the effort to fight Hass@@ an language in Myanmar , the company has a lot of meaningful content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; Kal@@ ar &apos; may usually be associated with racism , but the word itself is not automatically called Hass@@ an . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that also Po@@ sts , where they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts as to their use . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there are several bur@@ mes@@ an words with various mean@@ ings that have the same letter as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , chair will be written in Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &apos; ( Sp@@ age ) or &apos; Cal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ ebook@@ us@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the various mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a mail of one of my friends was now deleted because he contained the word of Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he had asked his friends on a spiritual way whether she kis@@ sing his back pain , having made a word play . &quot;
&quot; the set ku la - &quot; &quot; healing &quot; &quot; ( ku ) + the key@@ word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
&quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ ap@@ ed is the opinion that they hate a language of radi@@ al nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook analyses , before it all Po@@ sts Lö@@ sche , who circul@@ ate in susp@@ ected racism . &quot;
Facebook delet@@ es the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it automatically fil@@ tered the word automatically .
the automation is not understood what you write on Fac@@ be@@ ook .
&quot; what it should do instead , is the post carefully to analyse and control it by checking the words . &quot;
for example &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; ( Sp@@ altern@@ ate ) .
&quot; the good is that these three @-@ story nation@@ alists , spread the Hass@@ an , a fairly good lesson . &quot;
now it is time to circum@@ cis@@ ion their nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to everyone who dissem@@ inate the Hass@@ an , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long . &quot;
&quot; the experience of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proved that the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of keywords often create a k@@ atz@@ - and mouse game , whereby the users can easily begin using social networks to express a new word or an alternative sp@@ elling of the cen@@ sored Word to express their views . &quot;
&quot; the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described , how Facebook started to delete his po@@ ise , when he only wanted to communicate his friends that the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; is banned from the social network : &quot;
&quot; when I was attentive to this new directive by Facebook , I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the Word is closed . &quot;
&quot; ir@@ on@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was banned the Li@@ ken , post and parts of content for 24 hours because the post &quot; Facebook community standards have not been met . &quot;
Facebook has a variety of po@@ ies of people who have no negative intentions or just try to show their opinions against the Hass@@ an nation@@ alist nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his mail was removed who has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
&quot; in the post , the author told his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad . &quot;
&quot; Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should do more at the beginning of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community ask for advice : &quot;
&quot; Facebook likes a ben@@ evol@@ ent intent to reduce racism in Burma by their platform , but it does not work . &quot;
such words to cen@@ sored will only bring more hat@@ red within the different communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems as if they have started with no local context or technical support and have just banned words like &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; inheritance curr@@ y . &quot;
&quot; even as they have found that they have made mistakes , they were not tried to res@@ o@@ fold the fal@@ si@@ fied po@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits , which would give them a great turnover , it would be great . &quot;
Fac@@ ebooks automatic ig@@ ensu@@ r has taken care of a lot of sp@@ ri@@ soon among users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users now turn on Facebook and consciously writing the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of Hass@@ an , to see whether their po@@ sts are taken from the grid . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook @-@ Po@@ sts , who have no hate speech but nevertheless removed : &quot;
with permission used .
the Bur@@ mes@@ an Text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and watch the inheritance curr@@ y and watch an Indian film .
&quot; only to try out whether Facebook contains the post office , which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;

&quot; the post &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot;
screenshot is used with permission .
&quot; in the last five years , extreme nation@@ alistic ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used social networks to expand their voices and their influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , Hass@@ an in social networks the violence in the communities in Myanmar are in addition to heating , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where conflicts between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to escape . &quot;
Facebook has been to be cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed for his distor@@ tion and talk to his bur@@ mes@@ an sites under control .
&quot; but rather than simply the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; to cen@@ sored , it could have been better working more in the context than on code concentrated initiatives and learned from them . &quot;
in Tr@@ ini@@ dad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is an end to the children &apos;s love
a wedding ring in the sand .
&quot; by Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC BY 2.0 . &quot;
the children &apos;s go is illegal in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago now .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament adopted by the country unanim@@ ously decided that this practice is to offer , so that the native age is now at 18 . &quot;
&quot; prior to this amendment of the spouse , some members held Hind@@ u and mus@@ li@@ ous religious faith in practice , and in May 2016 , the leader of inter@@ religious organization ( IR@@ O ) , a group , representatives of the various religious groups of the country gathered that the state does not inter@@ f@@ ere , as that , age does not occupy the maturity . &quot;
&quot; this happened , regardless of the fact that Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago is a contracting partner of the UN law convention , the minority interests , each person under the age of 18 . &quot;
&quot; the UN statistics for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who were married with 15 already in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago 2.7 percent , and with 18 it were 8,@@ 1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the Statistical Office of the country confirmed that from 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys below 19 were married . &quot;
&quot; online peti@@ tions and social media movements , the stri@@ ves were to make laws to children , followed at the foot and pleas@@ ing herself of great support . undoubtedly , they helped them to bring this result . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , not everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Hind@@ u @-@ leader for example had no concerns to say the critics of the children &apos;s wo@@ e , they should dam@@ n &apos;t take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this sort of religious opposition absor@@ b for tension in this actually uncomplicated thing , and eventually got doubt if the opposition would agree with the Legisl@@ ative Decree at all . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of 2017 , the Legisl@@ ative Decree was decided against the children &apos;s letter - despite 4 Sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , which he could be discussed in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , where a simple majority would take him to the law . &quot;
&quot; now only the president of the country have to agree , and the law must declare that . &quot;
&quot; one of the sen@@ ators of the country gave on Facebook a Status update , which re@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ ag@@ ram once again : &quot;
Mr Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the legisl@@ ature against the Children &apos;s House was agreed with 35 votes for this and no single against it .
&quot; after having been decided in the Senate , the draft legislation can now become a law . &quot;
the majority of the Social Media User was enth@@ r@@ alled because the laws of the children were finally changed .
&quot; Facebook @-@ member Lov@@ ell Francis , who is a minist@@ erial post in the Ministry of Ministry , said : &quot;
&quot; it has all too much time and unnecessary sm@@ ells , which did the core of the thing , but know what ? the children &apos;s go is illeg@@ ally located in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago now and that &apos;s almost every price . &quot;
&quot; while A@@ bel Jackson of opinion was , it &apos;s definitely long enough to make the practice , Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas overwhel@@ med that the day finally came : &quot;
&quot; public Status update on Facebook by Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , Excellent News ! &quot;
the spouse has been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belon@@ ged to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil society group which openly talked about how important the adoption of the law was , noted : &quot;
the hei@@ gh@@ tening age in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago is now independent from the religion of religion .
&quot; the draft for the amendment of the spouse was today , held on 9 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives there are 41 members , and there were 35 members in the vote . &quot;
&quot; all members of MEPs have agreed , have agreed for the law . &quot;
the children &apos;s h@@ ehe is no longer allowed in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # &apos;s marri@@ ages .
many thanks to all activi@@ sts who have established him .
congratulations .
a thanks to our MEPs .
&quot; but a possible hook comes in the form of Sat Mahar@@ aja therefore , the Secretary General of the San@@ at@@ an Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hind@@ u organization of the country . &quot;
&quot; months ago Mahar@@ aja has announced his intention to do justice to the law , the law should be adopted , and he seems to be able to redeem His promises . &quot;
&quot; during the General State University Paris Al ra@@ wi , a constitu@@ tionally of the law , said , unless Mahar@@ aja wants to go against the law , the most social media user , the debate would lead to the issue differently . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rell suggested :
&quot; dear Sat , if we , instead of keeping the discussion so generally speaking , in a way that we will protect the state into our bedrooms that we may protect the state into our bedrooms , that they may abuse them from great , hard @-@ minded men that are ab@@ used to them , would then be ready to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or believe it is not a problem ?
&quot; but whether there is an important step towards a judicial action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where the children &apos;s go in different gra@@ dations , or continuing the norm , although there are laws they say . &quot;

&quot; although many present @-@ experienced Internet users are used to use conver@@ ting tools for blocking websites ( an up @-@ to @-@ date article about the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third @-@ largest VPN pre@@ valence of the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been published in Wikipedia since 2008 , as recently published in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ages of the internet since 2007 took place after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted . &quot;
&quot; after China , Turkey is the most widely known country in the world when it comes to massive c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship at Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform continues to be locked , are now several Mir@@ ror@@ pages ( pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and frequently sur@@ faced ) . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , as the platform to put all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its de@@ centr@@ alised Peer @-@ to @-@ Peer network ( i.e. computer calcul@@ ators ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship difficult . &quot;
the content is available in spite of law@@ ful prohibition .
in a b@@ log@@ post IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
&quot; after we heard the news ( about the block@@ age of Wikipedia ) , we put everything about taking snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the possibility to read the contents on de@@ centralized and distributed fashion . &quot;
&quot; this can help users to watch at least all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org . &quot;
&quot; IP@@ FS also gave it that this step was carried out independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is merely a screen@@ shots and a dynamic version of the website . &quot;
&quot; however , Vik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to handle the sperm . &quot;
&quot; Cr@@ istian Con@@ sunny i from Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ p@@ pedi@@ .org , a Mir@@ ror@@ site from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project , that everyone can use to host similar mir@@ ror@@ pages if in the respective country is im@@ pris@@ oned . &quot;
Con@@ sun@@ i reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices member as well as employees with Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a proxy address to a mirror .
one acc@@ esses to a different URL that is not the original . that what you can see is from Wikipedia .
&quot; essentially the server leads the request to the right Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself if they are locked in Turkey . &quot;
this is executed by a server which is not in Turkey .

Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos that he looked around you , never satisfied . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with poor@@ ly positioned motives and balanced colors . &quot;
the motiv@@ ates him to carry himself a camera in himself and try to walk the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar to bring himself to the international stage at the age of 28 . &quot;
&quot; and his home place right next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offering him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos which direct the attention to Nep@@ as wildlife . &quot;
he described on Facebook as it helps him first @-@ class situation with his work :
&quot; I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natur@@ ist . what could it give a better for a passionate wilderness . &quot;
&quot; I just rested from home , when I suddenly called Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had a call of my Father , that on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river would be a leop@@ ard . &quot;
the river da@@ mm is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
I immediately burned with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
&quot; my father had been watching him and showed me the place on the other river page , where the Leopard was there and I immediately began to cr@@ ush pictures ! ! &quot;
Sag@@ ar aims to cooperate with the authorities to gain global recognition for N@@ ept@@ une and to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not so sc@@ ary as they look .
and he should know it because he stood Tig@@ ers already from face to face to face .
a tiger can not distur@@ b from the mind of the sheep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
&quot; also I was going home because of the darkness on the way home , when suddenly the king of the Bu@@ de@@ cks appeared . he immediately focuses on , and he bl@@ inded me through the S@@ al trees ! ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot;
&quot; however , his passion for the promotion of N@@ ept@@ une and wild animals is not always easy . &quot;
&quot; he wa@@ ited for 22 days , and mostly lived in a tent to make the Bar@@ dia National Park recordings of Ot@@ tern . up to 12 days it lasted until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds , which live near the tourist information . &quot;

&quot; this article was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on Video Volunte@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community @-@ community organization from India . &quot;
a updated version was once again published as part of a content sharing .
&quot; in many parts of India there are women with the greatest care , the name of their spouse or even older men in the family . &quot;
instead they use a pron@@ oun or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pr@@ ad@@ esh give women to respect them due to social pressure the husband , as well as fear of the consequences , they should ab@@ ide by the norm to keep this practice alive . &quot;
&quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condemned from the Indian State O@@ dish@@ a by a sl@@ ab and passed away from her family and the village community after they had belon@@ ged to its own relatives with names . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of her spouse also does not call on behalf , is also common among men . however , they have much less assignment to fear if at all , they should not come back to this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel , as well as house@@ wives , a unique club with and were quick to the main magnificent theme of the city . &quot;
it is a place just for them alone where they can discuss and discuss the int@@ ric@@ acies of patri@@ arch@@ ate .
&quot; as one of 56 clubs which there is in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Ba@@ dal &apos;s campaign , which is operated by the Community Video Volunte@@ ers and advoc@@ ates for the dismant@@ ling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ has been working with the help of their video camera at the discovery of practices , such as children &apos;s disease , to the exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and guides these clubs . &quot;
&quot; it reports of how these clubs have created a safe place for these women , and at the same time have made them to amb@@ assador of change . &quot;
&quot; the first video , the Roh@@ ini showed in its discussion , was of women who do not call her husband &apos;s name . &quot;
she has chosen for this issue because they wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with whom women can easily identify .
&quot; to send the name of her husband &apos;s name not loud , a breeze is also maintained and never ques@@ tioned all of them . &quot;
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition tes@@ tified that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who is not rede@@ emed is regarded as a woman as a woman without mor@@ ality .
tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought of it for this discussion .
&quot; at the beginning of the Roh@@ ini , who has never called her husband to have never seen on behalf at home as it runs . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion with her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
&quot; my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband still wei@@ gh long , after the video was at the end . &quot;
&quot; practi@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , I shall name him from now on in his name . &quot;
with this self confidence in the luggage the Roh@@ ini started its first discussion .
&quot; many women had heard the word &quot; &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; &quot; nor ever before . some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pr@@ ad@@ esh . &quot;
&quot; after the video project , the women tried to bring discussion with a exercise in motion . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked every participant , the name of her husband with different feelings to say - happy , sad , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she asked them all , &quot; If we cannot say the name of our husband , but they can call us how they want , meaning that they do not respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of her husband in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra over the Bre@@ eding of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which married women could never speak the name of their spouse . &quot;
Roh@@ ini tells :
&quot; a woman was so shy , that she was just col@@ ouring the whole exercise , one another decided to allow all the du@@ sting fru@@ stration against him and his family by taking him flu@@ ent . &quot;
the expression in their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; even in the adren@@ alin about it , having an ancient Br@@ even broken , the women decided that they would actually try home to call her husband &apos;s name . &quot;
and they kept their word .
Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports in the next few days .
the husband &apos;s wife called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas they put in the head : his wife couldn &apos;t stop his name .
another cl@@ ub@@ board chose to do it during dinner in front of the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she died , she got fear and said that there was a mistake . &quot;
&quot; another woman said : &quot; Roh@@ ini said , I shall do it . &quot;
a husband &apos;s husband was less compreh@@ ending and the situation of art@@ ete in violence .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reported how women have tried to stop different practices , such as the stret@@ chers of the galvan@@ ic point on the forehead , who indicates the sp@@ acy : &quot;
why do women need to show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would wear the red @-@ red point , if he also worked . &quot;
he laugh@@ ed only and I heard that to wear him .
&quot; the other women do not have heard completely , but mean , they are now in a better position , even to choose him not to carry it in some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can share their opinions and objectives . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip on every talk . &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to worry that women could worry about who could hear , &quot; &quot; says it . &quot;
during the last months she celebrated her own birth@@ days with cakes ; they d@@ anced and spoke about things that they had never had thought of before .
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I also have some things , for example like our identi@@ ties to our husband , are never so honest . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to say certain things loud , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
&quot; in a discussion , we talk about the concept of honour and how it is connected to clothing . &quot;
some women in the group have carried only ancho@@ red since their homes .
&quot; for most of them the okay , but some wanted a sal@@ ta @-@ c@@ ta , a wide shirt on a p@@ ants , carry ; they have not comfor@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; after a lot of dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own clothes choice , the mor@@ ality associated with the sar@@ is and much more , dirty Roh@@ ini her own pair of Kur@@ tas ( Ober@@ shirt ) , so that the women could wear them . &quot;
&quot; next , they have decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is certain that they will create it . &quot;
&quot; on the question , whether in the five months have changed something in the five months , the Roh@@ ini confirms that things are slowly coming into their roles : &quot;
we have done just small steps so far .
&quot; some women tried it a few times , but then listened to the name of her husband &apos;s name . &quot;
&quot; some , including me , make it still , but only when they are alone and no other family members are there . &quot;
only one or two continue to say the name of her husband ; only one or two women are now wearing Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their forehead .
women in the discussion know that changes they want to achieve in their lives - such as the sol@@ em@@ ite for more freedom of movement or the own clothes choice - at the end of a difficult to navig@@ ating river .
&quot; by giving each other self confidence , they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am also .
but this club gives everyone of us confidence that will change something .
&quot; and I know that there is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction after every woman in the club , and other people are talking about what we talk and what we do . &quot;
we are all sitting in the same boat .

it is the first time that consecutive attacks have been registered on gl@@ uc@@ ose men in Moz@@ ambi@@ que .
another group which is the purpose of spec@@ tions for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes is people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to that the UN 2016 launched a mission in the South African country to investigate these practice .
&quot; the persecution of people with Al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of the southern Africa , especially in neighboring Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight these su@@ pers@@ ti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces . &quot;

a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia probably was recently made .
this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 in Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
&quot; the case of the det@@ ained Chinese dis@@ si@@ dents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o attracted attention in the international community after being announced after the lawyer at the end of June , that he has been delivered in the hospital for liver cancer in the final stage . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years of prison for &quot; &quot; Subversion &quot; &quot; after he had participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that took the democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the No@@ bel Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the State Department in China has called Li@@ us case as &quot; an internal affair &quot; and a sp@@ okes@@ man told , he did not need it as &quot; not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot;
&quot; still China continues to receive views from the international community , the No@@ bel lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , ti@@ lt Li@@ u X@@ ia , release or give it a treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely out of the matter . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
un@@ united Nations
&quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High @-@ Com@@ miss@@ ar of the United Nations for Human Rights , met at the end of June Chinese official to discuss the fall of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; however , a speaker led it to comment whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Li@@ u in foreign abroad . &quot;
Norway
Norway &apos;s prime minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende have consec@@ u@@ ded to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway took part in the Sto@@ cks , after the No@@ bel Peace Prize 2010 was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian Government taught that this ultimately has nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
diplomatic relations were continued until December last year . only in June the Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon to China since the exports have been largely blocked since 2010 .
after the message had been spread that Li@@ u was seriously posed to express the No@@ bel Committee his hope of an unconditional release for expression and lu@@ d Li@@ u to pick his prize in Oslo .
due to its adher@@ ence it was not able to take his prize .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
&quot; on 6 July , the European Parliament passed a vote in which China was asked to release li@@ u and his wife immediately from hous@@ ar@@ rest and allow him to seek medical support , where he wants . &quot;
&quot; the top diplom@@ ats of the EU , Federica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , called for China also for the release of Li@@ us as they were in a statement on 30 June . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect all the limitations of Mr. Li@@ us wife and family members . &quot;

&quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad shared with that the Americans called for him that he has the opportunity for treatment abroad , in this respect it may help him with his comrades . &quot;

&quot; the invitation of the US message attracted an angry response from China , with the utter@@ ance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; &quot; no land has the right to inter@@ f@@ ere and ir@@ responsible comments on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared with that China should offer following the couple :
&quot; protection and freedom , such as buses and access to the medical care of his choice , to which they are entitled to the Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the US Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Je@@ ff Mer@@ kl@@ ey and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision in the Congress to push the Chinese government to allow the Chinese government to release li@@ u and his wife condi@@ tionally . &quot;
I urge China to release the No@@ bel lau@@ re@@ ates # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o condi@@ tionally so that he can go to a proper medical treatment . http : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o

Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
previously diplomatic sources in Beijing of the news Agency Reu@@ ters that China had great concerns whether the vor@@ tex could be over@@ thrown by Li@@ u the visit in Hamburg .

on 28 June the Canadian amb@@ assador John Mc@@ Call@@ um China ur@@ ged to provide appropriate medical care and give it the opportunity to embrace himself from his family .
&quot; Li@@ us attorney told AF@@ P previously , Li@@ u X@@ ia , Li@@ u X@@ ia who could visit him every day , but the police are always allowed the room in the hospital and that it is Li@@ u not permitted to speak with someone outside , including his law@@ yers , to speak and contact . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells more :
&quot; Canada demands China on its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , to keep true and im@@ pris@@ oned to the exercise of these rights . &quot;
France
&quot; France &apos;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs demanded China in a statement on 29 June , Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons : &quot;
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o all treatments will receive , which he needs , regardless of where , his wife and family will have contact to him . &quot;
&quot; although the message @-@ called France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , gave the State Department known that there is no further information out whether France will eventually take him . &quot;
Taiwan
&quot; the Council of the Fes@@ tive matters in Taiwan called on 27 June to release li@@ u , and to show a greater tolerance to those who use peaceful remedies in order to call political reforms and democratic development . &quot;
&quot; the Tai@@ w@@ anese legisl@@ ator Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu of the ruling Democratic Party ( EPP ) , China also called on to allow intellec@@ tu@@ ally intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan . &quot;

he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my faith that the initiatives he took and for which he was ri@@ pped up , to a harmon@@ ious , stabili@@ zing and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn had contributed to a peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I felt personally moved and also encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the Charter 08 signed , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or country ?
&quot; the question may be stupid since Singapore is recognized as an independent state , as an independent state . &quot;
&quot; but according to the Minister of Justice , K. Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am should be regarded as a city in Singapore . &quot;
this observation has triggered a debate in the blog@@ osph@@ ere .
&quot; during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international two @-@ law Association of the State of New York , the Minister that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they are compared with other countries . &quot;
he support Singapore as a city should be considered .
... no one has ques@@ tioned whether New York is a democracy ...
&quot; this is , whereby most people make a mistake . &quot;
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io acc@@ used the Minister of Justice to rot@@ ate the logic to defend its existing author@@ itarian exercise in power in Singapore .
&quot; and then , according to all our efforts and sacrific@@ ing to create this valuable land , you can say that we are not a country at that time . &quot;
&quot; it seemed so vul@@ gar , it had the acceptance of a escape from the responsibilities , a mandatory infringement . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , eat land is it then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons by Shan@@ sh@@ ug@@ am were not very no@@ bles : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries , in view of his , he appeared inev@@ it@@ ably un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently led by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; once you reach the core point of the subject , the good old g@@ rief resi@@ des from the author@@ itarian rulers , leave the vor@@ tex logic , since it fits better to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the final week we gave answers to his American guests regarding our press , our jubil@@ ee , our political system really non @-@ answers . &quot;
frequently asked questions with non @-@ answers rational art .
&quot; Rachel Z@@ eng asks Shan@@ sh@@ ug@@ am to clear his opinion , since they did not understand this conclusion . &quot;
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
&quot; where Singapore is not a country , but a city is , so for what country is our city ... &quot;
briefly I understand nothing .
&quot; I would be very thankful when our value K Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am to take on the trouble to clarify this point , unless he paid high , to be part of the government of the city of Singapore . &quot;
&quot; published by An@@ on on the blog his commentary , he pointed to the reviews that you should begin to understand the entire co @-@ ordin@@ ance of the conference to better understand the context of the statements of Shan@@ sh@@ ug@@ on better , according to which Singapore is a city and no land . &quot;
read the tran@@ scription .
&quot; as he said that Singapore was more of a &quot; city , &quot; as a country , &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore are so un@@ equally important when we are looking forward to free and fair elections . &quot;
he spent Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw decades a party ? ) .
&quot; when he said , Singapore &quot; is not a country , &quot; he has obviously not meant to be in this sense ! &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his disappointment on Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am , which makes a leader of an her@@ an@@ growing generation , such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement . &quot;
&quot; I am over what the Minister of Minister of Singapore has told , very embarrass@@ ed ... &quot;
&quot; at least I knew by Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de , which expect me - if I do not agree with them or not , but this is another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am , a member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore , I doub@@ ting and I am not even sure if he really believes that he really believes . &quot;
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review breaks the weaknesses of Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ ams Arg@@ um@@ bers :
&quot; did Mr Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ on &quot; &quot; cou@@ gh@@ ing a mistake &quot; &quot; or was it a mis@@ erable speaker ? &quot;
&quot; where Singapore is not a country , we will only be regarded as an independent and sovereig@@ n state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , on which country go back the sovereig@@ n rights of the city of Singapore ? &quot;
&quot; Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city . &quot;
&quot; as he plays an important role within the government , the statements of Mr Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am is of severe meaning . &quot;
&quot; why do the Lon@@ av@@ ements their military service , they only defend their city but not its country ? &quot;
who must pay our Prime Minister b@@ ills ?
what is the value of our pink recruitment ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; the magazine Journey to a Dec@@ ade for affir@@ m@@ ation , Singapore is and has always been a city : &quot;
&quot; I have not told what I said ... &quot;
this proposition seems to have many av@@ ala to become angry ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we always were a city .
we have always been a town - / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; the defence of the country especially &quot; &quot; etc . , but that &apos;s not quite true . &quot;
we should rather talk of the defence of the city .
the myth of the &quot; cute Can@@ adi@@ ers &quot;

global Vo@@ ices asked before short his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or home country ?
their answers are published here as part of a continuous line published with ru@@ m@@ ors over certain parts of the world and to show another fac@@ et .
&quot; the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ is Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
&quot; the question , which is asked me most in Japan , is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , sorry I am sorry , &quot; &quot; I am from Canada . &quot; &quot; I am from Canada . &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered to be a polite , interest in his conversation by providing personal questions . &quot;
&quot; this clearly follows the default language : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice @-@ hockey , nature . &quot; many can@@ adi@@ er cook perhaps inn@@ umer@@ able before wi@@ ut , if they are held for Americans but me does not distur@@ b . &quot;
&quot; for someone who doesn &apos;t know , there is little that distingu@@ ishes us Can@@ adi@@ er from Americans . &quot;
&quot; this is one of the reasons why so many cann@@ adi@@ ans can bring a Canadian Fl@@ ag , well visible in their back@@ pack if they travel . &quot;
all love Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans on the other hand ... .
&quot; so it was already when I began 20 years ago , to travel through the world - before Donald Tru@@ mp , in front of the march in Iraq and before September 11 . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le blades at their luggage to differenti@@ ate yourself from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care !
with us there is no weapons !
gender E@@ hen are legal in Canada since 2005 !
&quot; all seem to think , Canada is so great . &quot;
we are courteous .
&quot; we obviously say very often &quot; sorry . &quot; &quot;
Canada is suppos@@ edly considered as the toler@@ ant country opposite ethnic groups .
we are not just like these types south of the border .
we can@@ adi@@ er are nice .
I hate .
&quot; first , I have many American friends I was very ad@@ mi@@ red . &quot;
&quot; I would not do anything , if one would change myself for example with Johnny from Dallas . &quot;
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
there are also some problems with the stamps &quot; nice . &quot;
&quot; first : as a &quot; nice &quot; to be called &quot; , &quot; in essence , sp@@ ie@@ fly to be - just like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle , but trag@@ ically un@@ important figure NE@@ D Fl@@ anders from &quot; The Simp@@ son &quot; ( which has its own Canadian double @-@ ans ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada really would be a nation of people like NE@@ D Fl@@ anders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; does not have a personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing , where you can encounter . &quot;
being harmless and un@@ ob@@ tr@@ usive and un@@ interesting to be and no attention to earn .
&quot; this can be something good if you want to keep un@@ noticed in the background , distant from the things that happen around you . &quot;
&quot; I would even go far , to say that the desire to be free and alone , a main part of the Canadian . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
&quot; what out@@ standing as &quot; nice &quot; &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans are not often talking about the fence with the neighbors .
&quot; we lack a warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends . &quot;
&quot; luck@@ ily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) then Jus@@ tin Tru@@ de@@ au bet@@ ray@@ al the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ er are more than just &quot; nice &quot; . our prime minister has made Canada a straight sexy . &quot;
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ odi@@ ert Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; one in Thailand famous pop @-@ band released a music video that domin@@ ates the junk@@ ta , which will take power , and despite their promises , the Civil Government continues to restore the country . &quot;
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells about which rules him his friend .
&quot; although not expressly politically , the music video refers directly to the continued military rule of the jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was pra@@ ised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video of the song was a great success .
&quot; only within the first three days , this was shared on Facebook loaded video 1.@@ 254 times and received 8.@@ 800 Li@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; last month even the Charlie @-@ Chap@@ lin @-@ Video &quot; &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; &quot; in Thailand has been blocked , after a group of activi@@ sts presented the public to watch this video . &quot;
the video can interpret as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics as it beha@@ ves with the situation of the country under the jun@@ ta rule .
&quot; take a look at these recordings of the video , which refer to some of the political issues that Thailand has followed in the past three years . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; may possibly refer to the dr@@ ak@@ onic section 44 of the pro@@ visional Constitution , which gives the tor@@ ch absolute decision @-@ making on important national issues . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the in@@ famous program for the &quot; &quot; employment change &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activi@@ sts , politicians and other individuals who are regarded by the Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot;
&quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer@@ crimin@@ ality , whose v@@ ague and un@@ clear rules are often used by the authorities to be responsible for activi@@ sts and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose there was also a new unit established in the army , the online content monitors and people who acc@@ esses the monarchy , the monarchy will be prosec@@ uted , criminal prosec@@ uted . &quot;
Thailand sets a bar@@ ric@@ ades against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ est@@ ä@@ war@@ dness ) .
in Thailand the war @-@ law was established in Thailand on 20 May 2014 .
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
&quot; one of the problems that the jun@@ ta continues to purchase is their decision expensive sub@@ marine boats , even though security experts they war@@ ned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of control . &quot;
&quot; in the video is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery car , before going into a inter@@ locking camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are sitting in prison , because they suppos@@ edly cause &quot; confusion &quot; in society , and Internet users will face long ar@@ rest , they should ins@@ ult@@ ed the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile the te@@ aser of the songs members of the band showed the Sal@@ ut of &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; who was already used by coup d opponents during the 2014 protests . &quot;

&quot; the post @-@ war society , only very slowly in East @-@ West @-@ Asia , mainly in the district of T@@ cu@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; now it has passed over 20 years , since the Georgian war has been officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still highly visible in this part of the Republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern districts in T@@ cu@@ arch@@ al show distinctive images .
&quot; villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and Khar@@ Chil@@ ava are situated in the carbohydr@@ ate of Ab@@ ch@@ Asia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , de@@ asi@@ es , Georgi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
&quot; today , for the most part Russians living and desc@@ ending in the area . &quot;
such settlements are called in Ab@@ ch@@ sia as well as violin @-@ cities .
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period there were more than 10,000 people , today there are only a few hundred people living in these violin cities . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ cu@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 the total population of the District 16.@@ 000 people , after it was barely increased over a decade . &quot;
in 1989 about 43.@@ 000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; everything is a result of war &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the empty fif@@ ties of the Soviet Union from the early 1960 &apos;s , called Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ tsch@@ u@@ kow@@ kas are symbo@@ lic@@ ally known for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are temp@@ ted and rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met with a native older man .
he begins a conversation and it is difficult to end this .
&quot; this is all a consequence of war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot;
it is still un@@ ambiguous . &quot;
in front of war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were municipalities , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens that served all of the community . &quot;
&quot; now , there are only paved road with f@@ aded splend@@ or @-@ buildings . &quot;
&quot; people who once lived in this place and their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union , have now left the district . &quot;
in the Gei@@ ster@@ stadt D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha live about fifty inhabitants .
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ tsch@@ ow@@ kas , who still houses one or two families , one can recognize on the balconies , where laundry is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they immediately move back . &quot;
&quot; our mother banned us that we let us photograph us , &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; she simply has forbidden , that is all . &quot;
the girl flu@@ kes her girlfriend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area are working for a small tur@@ quoise company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ ug@@ ol .
families are also involved in the subsi@@ st@@ ence ( cultivation of agricultural products for individual needs ) such as zo@@ ot@@ echni@@ cs , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetables . &quot;
it is difficult to come over the rounds .
the District management provides free candles in winter and bread to the villages .

&quot; I do not know what is happening , but we will build Zu@@ cch@@ ini &quot;
about ten years ago an older woman named Gal@@ ina ( or a@@ unt G@@ alya as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Jab@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; despite her oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave prior to Ab@@ ch@@ asi@@ es to live with her . &quot; &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ ch@@ ums &quot; , &quot; she tells . &quot;
Gal@@ ina wants not to accept financial aid from her daughter and insi@@ sts that she puts her young grand@@ son instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly r@@ ents are just nine dollars .

&quot; a 90 &apos;s wife and a young family , and I live in this building . &quot;
&quot; when holidays are , we visit us . &quot;
but we cannot do this constantly - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot;
&quot; while she tells her story , a younger neigh@@ bor appeared on the balcony . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ asch@@ a , called T@@ ante G@@ alya her . &quot; &quot; they said , we could build Zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
I have prepared the floor already .

&quot; &quot; &quot; we have no fear of the dark road or the few people . &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; in fact , it has more to do with lo@@ oting . &quot;
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived like it was right .
I remember how the city and war were once .
&quot; when our conversation turned out to the end , a little boy is passing by us . &quot;
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hidden .
a ball flies from the window and another boy j@@ agt to him .
he plays with the ball which then rolls the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball .
&quot; while running , some of them throw some stones out of the falling building . &quot;
these ruins are a part of her childhood who will take care of integrity in their lives .

in Mexico &quot; Mama Africa &quot; migrants on their long journey
&quot; Concep@@ ción Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the State of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border of Mexico to Guatemala . &quot;

&quot; this article by Amy Br@@ acken was published on 19 April 2017 , on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and appears here with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; on the road of migrants , Europe or Latin America , some places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
&quot; I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is on the border to Guatemala . &quot;
it is a very simple hotel close to the city center .
&quot; it is led by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mex@@ ic@@ an@@ erin , a small woman with a cor@@ als pink spectac@@ les and gold colored ear@@ rings in ed@@ dy bears form . &quot;
it is called Concep@@ ción Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born there in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . yet they know many under the name of Mama Africa .
&quot; this nickname is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it ) become a goal for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tian , who are on transit . &quot;
the hotel has rather no charm .
&quot; for about 2,50 dollar the night sleeping the guests in simple rooms , with cold , cru@@ m@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the pre @-@ room there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a c@@ age .
there is no gu@@ ide@@ post to the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Haiti emig@@ rants here .
&quot; sometimes , Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez , the people told in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call : &quot; &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you Mama ? . .
&quot; at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez have already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept out there on cardboard . &quot;
it does not want to reject anyone .
&quot; she also helps them and bring them to hospital when they are sick , they buy them medicines that they cannot pay them , they mass@@ aged with a bel@@ ong@@ ation from the long journey in@@ exhaus@@ tive feet . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived in a short time ago . &quot;
I asked him if Mama Africa is a reasonable nickname for Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Sebasti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i that has a yo@@ sta@@ che ) posi@@ ert with Concep@@ ción Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Br@@ acken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; reply with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it fits to her , because African women are very nice women . &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
&quot; Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister , who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children . &quot;
&quot; you have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to take a first stop in South America and then move towards north . &quot;
&quot; the family had belon@@ ged from other roads to Mama . &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he tells that Hai@@ ti@@ ans and Afri@@ cans are often travelling together the route and that the Afri@@ cans already talk to W@@ hat@@ s@@ App from Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; as many of his companion , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a buil@@ ders on construction sites of the Olympic Games and World World Championship . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he has started his journey into the United States . &quot;
he has been guest at Mama Africa : he has sold SIM card to save the necessary money to buy the b@@ usti@@ cket to Ti@@ juana .
I wonder whether he will have contact with Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let them go back , &quot; reply &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells that their guests have often asked their text when they have gone to greet them or to tell her about the course of their trip .
it declar@@ es that her Christian faith is the drive of their work .
&quot; they do not know much about Africa , but their guests have contributed their chicken breasts like in Ghana . &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very known here but it is not the only tri@@ ken hope for migrants who travel through tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city leads a dead @-@ sac to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter have added to Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family immigrants in their small house .
he is polic@@ eman and has established that the b@@ usti@@ ckets are sold to numerous African immigrants .
&quot; he has started to help them get a reasonable price , then he has offered them his house for a dollar spent the night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment are 25 people there , mainly Hai@@ ti@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on blankets on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cook@@ ery outside . &quot;
&quot; Valencia explains , that he knows what the guests are going through . &quot;
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he tells . &quot; I experienced what they experience . &quot;
I crossed the border over the wilderness and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . this is the reason why I give them my support .
&quot; after having lived for three years , he was rejected after a raid on his working position from the United States . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants who travels through tap@@ ach@@ ula , comes from Central America , other inhabitants also open the doors of their houses for them . &quot;
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ é@@ n@@ dez told me that he had fled to people in Honduras with his wife and his three children who wanted to press his money without having a plan .
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he has asked for an accommodation and a Unknown , an all@@ ey@@ eli@@ ble , has offered him the roof . &quot;
&quot; a few months later the family lives still there , and she tries to decide where the next steps should go . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests .
in the courses consult the travelers calm their phones .
&quot; a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a large part from Somalia . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that their house is full , but it is also a nostal@@ g@@ ically because of those who have gone . &quot;
like a stum@@ ble grand@@ mother she sang her album with many photos .
&quot; there are one of her daughter with African hair fle@@ e who has made a Kund@@ ler , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travellers more , boy and Old . &quot;
they lau@@ gh so while she told me briefly .
&quot; Y@@ a se fu@@ eron , &quot; repe@@ ats it every time . &quot; they are already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install on their cell@@ phones a surveillance app .
a Check @-@ Point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ā@@ le of Twitter @-@ user
&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , a ethnic minorities region in the west of China are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their cell@@ phones . &quot;
&quot; on 10 July the phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of the town Uru@@ m@@ qi had a cell al@@ erts when it points the District government , a surveillance app called j@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; &quot; Web Cleaning &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the communication , the app is said to gain access to terrorist information . &quot;
&quot; yet , the authorities use the app to use the app for more than the fight against terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h Women in the autonom@@ ous I@@ li Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ fecture , because they had after they had installed the app , messages with a private We@@ chat group . &quot;
&quot; in the communication of the police stood that the app will determine the sources and the distribution paths of terrorists and follow , together with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ angs website describes the app as follows :
j@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective field with system categories for children and adults introduced by Ji@@ it@@ u Telec@@ om .
&quot; the main function is the block@@ ade por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , from online fraud , Troj@@ ans and Ph@@ ishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online , and to control the own home network . &quot;
this App with the filters for min@@ ors should help children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
&quot; for example , the &quot; &quot; remote &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; actors or even h@@ ackers fails to manipul@@ ate the home network of a person or ste@@ al it . &quot;
this introduction is in harmony with other measures to take control of digital activities in this region .
&quot; while reports about digital c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in China often focus on the experience of users in larger cities in the east and south , the reality is very often d@@ ü@@ ster@@ er for those who live in remote , pre@@ dict@@ ated ethnic minority regions like X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in the conflict @-@ areas , the authorities often arrange extreme conditions and monitoring measures as well as rout@@ in@@ ant internet shut@@ downs . &quot;
&quot; this based on Twitter based media out@@ let &quot; Images from this China &quot; &quot; Bec@@ ause it has been published in China , showed photos of a check@@ point , on the polic@@ emen , the inhabitants check out then check out whether it was installed the surveillance app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification required that the people install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software they could be det@@ ained up to 10 days .
this is a return for technological development .
&quot; they have forced the people to use equipment , which are intended for elderly people . &quot;
this is a form of the imprisonment of rest technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from &quot; &quot; China &quot; &quot; ( Bec@@ ause I haven &apos;t been in today ) , in addition , a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang Product description , out of which eman@@ ates that the software can lift the passwords of a Windows operating system and thus obtain un@@ restricted access to the hard drive of the computer . &quot;
after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang your computer and mobile phones are available in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang for electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
&quot; the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may possibly be a reaction to the instructions of the city council , to minimize the dissemination of illegal contents . &quot;
&quot; all government institutions , authorities and the party connected , including universities and research institutes are oblig@@ ated to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security office during operation of their computers and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; a current report from Freedom House , an American @-@ American human rights organization , mentioned also this new surveillance methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published on 27 June in a district of regional capital of Uru@@ m@@ qi a regulation with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs until 1 August their &quot; personal ID @-@ cards , mobile drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously identifying any &quot; terrorist videos &quot; and destroy it . however , this action is infr@@ inging the personality rights of Uru@@ m@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and there are pen@@ alties for a whole series of other possible achievements , including those that refer to peaceful religious or political communications . &quot;
sleep or death - part 1 : all scre@@ ams after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo by : Cor@@ rie Bar@@ kli@@ more ( CC BY 2.0 ) .
&quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; sleep or death , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane signs his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far from our blue , virtual world you see you and stell@@ ate you that you are completely at a place where all the most important . &quot;
&quot; everything has gradually been solved , and a truth covered , which is clearly recogni@@ zable , both inside and outside . &quot;
one that makes their name all glory .
a that has drawn into a list of feelings and expres@@ sions depres@@ sed that allow no met@@ aph@@ ors .
&quot; but if you get the reality again and you behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and the performers - turn the characters in beings from flesh and blood , and all cry unto death . &quot;
&quot; all doubts det@@ ach in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even if the earth is caught on the axis of the un@@ hei@@ ls . it is clear that you are caught here between the walls that your parents , and before them have built your grand@@ parents , stone to stone . &quot;
&quot; they have arrested me and my father three times , but that did not do so , that I would like &quot; &quot; my lesson &quot; , &quot; like the leader of the security services it form@@ ulated - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot;
he put his power over us under evidence by even the simpl@@ est concepts destroyed we knew .
five young people were buried during a peaceful protests as weed from the beautiful gardens of our revolution .
it consists of so that the city broke out the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; - Schrei@@ er .
&quot; all city &apos;s cov@@ eted , just my own . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was silent , reg@@ ain , at the wrong time , even if I had no high demands for a city that is st@@ amp@@ ed up to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; in the third night things had cal@@ med down , after the power supply in the quarter hear@@ ken to function . &quot;
I broke the silence by crying out several times &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house@@ da@@ ch .
I heard my voice res@@ ist by the silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt enough to find out .
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we are connecting to a glorious picture that fully met my expectations . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment you are aware that you are fre@@ ed the spirit from the lamp , but it is simply not interested in the sc@@ ing@@ est . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; makes you ready , we meet at the military security buildings . &quot;
he placed .
&quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can lie down - nothing can give you your voice , after you have sent you all the way to the office of the Security Service from the body . &quot;
I joined there .
the Ober@@ st Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there as I now also .
&quot; the Ober@@ st Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to speak : &quot; let me hear me how you are &apos; all@@ ahu Ak@@ bar , or you are only bra@@ ve enough to cry , if we are not nearby . &quot;
his h@@ ook@@ ed eyes sat upon me .
and you are genuine what to look into the eyes and not on the ground !
what I did so did nothing with courage to do .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was on my tor@@ ch , van@@ ity , perhaps on the revolution . &quot;
I was so sure in my job than I answered : &quot; I did not think that you have already forgotten my voice since yesterday .
&quot; and I think I have never stopped to look forward to seeing you in the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fat@@ ale consequences for me , and yet I regret not a word of what I said . &quot;
&quot; put it in single , and his father equal to this . &quot;
&quot; his father equal to this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the stu@@ d@@ rank of this curs@@ ed proposition is up to me today in the nose .
&quot; he became one of &quot; syndrome &quot; , &quot; a se@@ am torture , which I was exposed to monthly . &quot;
I penet@@ r@@ ite the farm .
in the first office I leave everything I tr@@ age with me .
&quot; afterwards , through the farm and into the second office , which leads through a hallway to the single cells . &quot;
I saw all the details exactly before I super@@ v@@ ise the room .
otherwise they have probably divided a large cell to me this time .
I have to share it with only one other prisoners and should immediately put me on without waiting for your permission .
&quot; after a few minutes , who felt like a whole life , the be@@ amer left the cell , and I went back to an old @-@ proven communication method : with the f@@ ist against the wall . &quot;
I learned that my Z@@ ellen@@ gen@@ esis was a &quot; Er@@ sth@@ en@@ ling . &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he answered me ultimately .
&quot; apparently , in no one of the surrounding cells was a prestigious man middle age , who sees me similar and called &quot; &quot; doctor &quot; . &quot; &quot;
in the perfect darkness don &apos;t let me know a distinctive face and doctors there are not here ; we are all just numbers .
&quot; perhaps someone , whose voice is similar to my sounds ? &quot;
all the answers are connected to its existence .
perhaps he was moved into one of the great cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
&quot; the investig@@ ator had assured me , they would be fre@@ il@@ dered if I stay . &quot;
ventilation .
I &apos;d like to have a bir@@ ths to exp@@ el all these cro@@ ws that lab@@ elled on the fruits in the garden of my head .
&quot; from the distance I hear them still &quot; &quot; Most ahu &quot; &quot; scre@@ am . &quot;
&quot; it must be at about 10 am in the evening , always around this time the hor@@ rors , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black the color of the verse is , until I saw the yellow light that gave us the Gre@@ ys in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Th@@ under &quot; , &quot; An@@ spiel@@ ung on 13th S@@ ure of the Quran ) . &quot;
they are here to listen to .
&quot; thus the secret was founded : to protect the security from us and prevent the terrorists in us , they speak in al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dial@@ ect - so they played their con@@ fer@@ ous detection card and ri@@ pped the close eye @-@ field of their world view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house , which here is not a country ; it is a cur@@ se that they call co@@ existence to turn it into a hero . &quot;
&quot; I super@@ v@@ ise the audi@@ ble and tre@@ ad to Abu I@@ mad , a slim and sto@@ cky man ; at least he comes me before . &quot;
&quot; he begins a &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the facial expres@@ sions , which begin to der@@ ail him : &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can join so much more important with your life than you will find these equ@@ itable , and to prot@@ esting to demonstrations , which will soon be an end . &quot;
I did not answer .
I used it to answer .
I can really no longer say exactly when ins@@ ults and stro@@ kes have become a friendly conversation for me to become an ordinary communication medium .
when and as it happened was un@@ important .
&quot; some voice in me said , that I had to be used at ease or used to be pun@@ ished , although I had done nothing to make this punishment . &quot;
to punishment in all its diversity .
its command is to pl@@ uck me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls the loving &quot; gest@@ ant . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe that probably originates from the clo@@ ister .
your ex@@ ecu@@ tioner is in your cry .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him , and you cannot stop your hor@@ semen . &quot;
&quot; my hor@@ rors were not yet enough , and why she re@@ ed the pipe through a cable inter@@ changeable . &quot;
at my first test I asked me if the investig@@ ator worked earlier times as a gar@@ bage collection or if that belon@@ ged to the normal working conditions .
&quot; they had four cable in@@ each other to present us the one , from their point of view , great invention of a huge cable . &quot;
within a single hour three of them changed three of them as I was still in the line .
&quot; I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , why I heard in hearing . &quot;
the ex@@ ecu@@ tioner noted the cooling down and found not at all at all because he used as a neighbour to an elec@@ tron@@ ically loaded stop .
&quot; electricity through my whole body , enough to feed my whole neighborhood . &quot;
&quot; my semi @-@ shot body , which was stretched out on the ground was the perfect power conductor . &quot;
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
this must be so at midnight .
&quot; I decided to lay down again again ; say we say , that was my only option . &quot;
&quot; a few hours left , which came to me as minutes . &quot;
then the call for the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens and the morning filled the room &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with thee , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; I rep@@ lied with the voice of an exhaus@@ tive youth , &quot; my Lord , my Father must be fear@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; be silent and be@@ weg you , you will be moved . &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they had always been released .
where do they lead me ? !
&quot; the j@@ or@@ dan@@ ic Rap@@ per Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b re@@ det the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + Community , freedom of expression and resistance &quot;
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ ked a cigar@@ ette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Ma@@ dan , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends the most of his time inside ; from time to his canvas , time to his computer , and again to his couch . &quot;
&quot; but what you can rely on , is a cigar@@ ette between his fingers or with ni@@ cot@@ t lips to discover . &quot;
&quot; he lives in the prime minister of his family house which had been united to them since 1967 ; in which Israel was completed his occupation of the West Bank , and H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family had been forced to fle@@ e out of their village in Palestine in which she had lived as fel@@ ah@@ y@@ een ( about : Far@@ mer ) . &quot;
&quot; for now six years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate majority , the conservative majority faces gender roles , sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapid music . &quot;
&quot; with his music , which often focuses on issues like Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and situation in Palestinian refugees . all these issues are not only seen in his hom@@ etown of Am@@ man Rel@@ ev@@ ance , but also in cities that reach from Damascus in Syria to San@@ aa in Y@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; with his 25 years H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as a person who is not restricted in his mind through borders , and he may suffer his own statement by the people who suffer the devast@@ ating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Y@@ emen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
even if he does not open it to the US American foreign policy a special disposition .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded from the author .
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe his compassion for those who try to do in war areas , anything with his identity as &quot; Palestinian &quot; fle@@ ed the second generation &quot; , &quot; even if he was born in Jordan , and has never been in Palestine yet . &quot;
&quot; I do not think because of my own living conditions , &quot; stres@@ ses H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; I think &quot; &quot; I am because I am a man &quot; &quot; while in water sol@@ dered as café in two cups ; it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan . in this time it is planned for Muslims , from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the j@@ or@@ dan@@ ic law also disc@@ usses that the public consumption of food is illegal during the Ram@@ adan .
&quot; obviously , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; and on the other hand a cup of coffee on a sen@@ sing hot junior day has little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
&quot; basically , the sm@@ oul@@ der warm coffee and the tail of the K@@ ent cigar@@ ette in the nose is primarily associated with freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky , especially when one gets a look into the neighbouring countries . &quot;
&quot; from hence , it is easy to do basic things - just like to drink the public during the Ram@@ adan of water - to do not land prison . &quot;
&quot; recently , the State Department has told the appearance of the band Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time . &quot;
&quot; some Par@@ liam@@ entary Assembly , which support the Islamic Action Front - argu@@ ed that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual fron@@ tage of Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , contradi@@ cts the cultural and traditional standards of the country and be contradi@@ c@@ tory the main reason for the concert . &quot;
&quot; the MP and former press pre@@ acher in the Islamic Coalition DI@@ MA Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert &quot; &quot; was cancelled &quot; &quot; because of the sexual orientation of the singer . &quot;
&quot; many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arabic spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is more dangerous acti@@ vis@@ m which represents the old @-@ proven legitimacy of author@@ itarian regimes in the entire region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement of Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la the j@@ or@@ dan@@ ic people as &quot; &quot; progressive suppor@@ ter of human rights &quot; , &quot; which continues to work for an intellectual and cultural plur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement is likely to be simply not simply conf@@ ession rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic , but actually an increasingly clear clear@@ ing reality in Jordan , which occurs in H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s work clearly . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b traditional sex towers , by having his vision of the fate of Arabian women , the vo@@ re@@ hel@@ i@@ chen sex have . &quot;
&quot; the picture shows the sk@@ elet@@ on of a apparently burnt @-@ known woman , their arms and legs to stretch up to the corners of the canvas . &quot;
&quot; it is surrounded by a red lake , perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those they should really trust . &quot;
&quot; in Jordan , the number of &apos; honorary murder &apos; has increased in Jordan , the in@@ official outside . &quot;
&quot; human Rights Watch that reached its peak in 2016 , however , that Jordan reached its peak ; however , its institutional infrastructure is missing to support the women , the victims tried Mor@@ ning or domestic violence . &quot;
&quot; according to a law to break@@ downs from the year 1954 , women who are exposed to the risk of in@@ vigor@@ ous violence , and for its release is often a years of bureaucr@@ atic effort and the guarantee of the family is necessary that the woman is nothing to happen . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is well known for it , even not rede@@ emed from subjects that in his country long as tab@@ u g@@ old . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b argu@@ ed that his work is politically , however , that he &apos;s his music , the full exp@@ on@@ ites of sexuality , freedom and expression is not separate from politics . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot;
&quot; mir was buried in politics , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity in attack .
&quot; in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; and in &quot; &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; is the focus on poverty . &quot;
&quot; the list of the songs , which are in the core politically , can be continued . &quot;
in March 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song named &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated many times :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot;
&quot; in the further course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a form of market in which one can get , in his words , &quot; what you want , &quot; - be faith or non @-@ faith , har@@ et@@ ero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
he noticed that hardly any one speaks in Jordan about the rights of gay and les@@ bian and that comments on equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + -@@ individuals were still sever@@ ed greatly in 2014 .
&quot; in 2014 H@@ da@@ i@@ b introduced a interview for the popular Rab@@ or@@ dan@@ ian Onlin@@ e@@ Program Ro@@ ya , in order to remember that his comments were tor@@ n out of the context , revol@@ ves and his opinion were cen@@ sored . &quot;
&quot; on Youtube it was up@@ loaded without cuts , but it was only a processed version , &quot; he says . &quot;
today H@@ da@@ i@@ b ac@@ qui@@ res H@@ da@@ i@@ b open to the Arabian LGB@@ T T@@ Q + Community and represents the opinion that intoler@@ ance towards homosexu@@ als do not walk in Islam .
&quot; he mentioned Abu Nu@@ what , a po@@ et of the eighth century , who is still alive today thanks to his hom@@ o@@ erotic poems in memory . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks yourself : if Abu Nu@@ dity could work once again on behalf of the cali@@ bre , in the eighth century I was openly able to write homosexu@@ ality , why not ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot;
&quot; in the Ha@@ schem@@ i@@ tic kingdom there is nothing new more that the government attacks on freedom of expression , and that progressive voices are brought to silence . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the j@@ or@@ dan@@ ic message service took several former government departments and members of the teaching network , with reason@@ ing , they would have expressed themselves on comments in social media to face problems that are rooted with deep in the country @-@ rooted corruption . &quot;
&quot; in view of this , the concert of H@@ da@@ i@@ bs believe only the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the real challenge is to make a structural conversion in the next generation of Jordan . &quot;
&quot; for him progress is a constant eye and taking . Jordan has now wo@@ unded for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - so it looks a slow , thought and inn@@ umer@@ able changes . he is sure that these changes will take place from day to day in the heart of the j@@ or@@ dan@@ ian society . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , also , from an Arab world without interventions from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he did not only bring his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to experience them . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region is using music , art and literature of real and fundamental openness - and not by bom@@ bs , stretching , and an artificial type of particular democr@@ acies . at least he hopes that . &quot;
&quot; until there is so far , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to res@@ ist and therefore also res@@ ist resistance . &quot;
this report was conducted by the Pul@@ itzer Center on Crisis Reporting for the A@@ man as a Student Fel@@ low .
Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three largest festivals in Japan .
these large , extr@@ av@@ ag@@ ant war@@ ri@@ bs are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
&quot; they assumed that there is a variant of Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually widely celebrated in August in many areas of To@@ ho@@ sters . another theory was postpon@@ ed that the drums and pun@@ ching over more than a thousand years were passed , to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi , into the kne@@ es . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to sn@@ ap a few great seats , therefore we have a super view . &quot;
you can only imagine how big these parts are ...
&quot; a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , hosted a two mon@@ ati@@ ge exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) . &quot;
I saw myself again the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en again for a long time : two fort@@ resses are straight to see .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori to take the Neb@@ uta Festival the only True - and in this way to spend a breathtaking manner in the summer : &quot;
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer@@ festival in the north of the country .
I was there and I looked at the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 meter high @-@ wag@@ ering was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

&quot; rarely , outer phenomenon and body care were as important as in this story , because they help the Peru@@ vian youth from crimin@@ ality and promote a legitimate profession like the hair@@ dres@@ ser . &quot;
&quot; El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us most important port , located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , located near the historic center of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where street consuming and illegal drugs are daily . &quot;
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region did not feel safe .
at the same time Peru - how many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
&quot; the trend , the appearance and therefore also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous spor@@ tsmen like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers that can make this elaborate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the un@@ preced@@ ented demand for hair@@ styles that go on the extreme limits of imagination and creativity , even has an annual event inspired , the competition of the hair@@ dres@@ ser &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os &quot; , which has been held since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; there are experts from each other , to demonstrate who can see the ex@@ centr@@ alised l@@ ooks , as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions , on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) . &quot;
&quot; educational institutions such as school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , who found himself in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to convince young people against hair@@ dressing tools and instead of bad advice on hair@@ dressing tools that allows them to find work . &quot;
motivated by this activity and offering opportunities have do@@ z@@ ens of young people that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops prior to the apprentic@@ eship at the end of March and reported on some of their achievements :
&quot; in 1995 we were the only specialist school in the church and the district , what we are very proud , because of love for the children we have built this educational community . &quot;
Colombia : love @-@ cri@@ ed to Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ak@@ ler

&quot; the following article is the edited version of the message &quot; Lov@@ em@@ aker to Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ak@@ ler , &quot; which released the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot;
the contribution will be published in the framework of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love cri@@ b@@ ness to people who we know ?
&quot; is it not still much more important , people who have b@@ agu@@ ed out , affection ? &quot;
exactly this question went out to the two young Colom@@ bian activi@@ sts of Leonardo P@@ ár@@ rag@@ a by the Young @-@ Youth Foundation and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth @-@ Foundation no longer from the head and inspired it to the campaign Cart@@ as p@@ or la re@@ cili@@ aci@@ ón ( Let@@ ters to reconciliation ) to write the young people to do Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ak@@ mp@@ en letters .
&quot; only in short years ago , her land became a historical event , and they wanted to help their part : after years , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace agreement with the Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ a@@ Movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary armed forces in Latin America ) , which forms the closing of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; International was the submission of the peace treaty , as so important that the Colom@@ bian president Jose Manuel San@@ tos was awarded for its services to the No@@ bel Peace Prize . &quot;
&quot; however , in front of the Colom@@ bian , there is still a long way to speak of a real reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; gu@@ err@@ illa war@@ ri@@ ans who have lived for many years in illegal camps , had to be suspended and around the clock for their weapons , must now be integrated into the life as civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society in turn , which acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to life in constant fear and in some cases deeply hat@@ red towards gu@@ err@@ illa war@@ ts , it must now take in their ranks and support them in building a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian were convinced that the young colum@@ bi@@ ans have to come together and help with the integration process .
and that is exactly what they did : until now I have written thousands of young people &apos;s letters - love bot@@ s on former gu@@ err@@ ands to welcome them back in society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ac fighters - which should be personally handed over .
the Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for the healing was born on the World Summit of the No@@ bel Peace Prize , who held in February 2017 in Bog@@ ot@@ á . there were Leonardo and Cr@@ istian the opportunity to speak briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ ar@@ thi , which was awarded the No@@ bel Peace Prize in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; we said that we love the people , who love , on Valentine &apos;s Day thousands of Lov@@ ing , but those are forgotten that they need much unnecessary . &quot;
&quot; he plan , told he continued to share his love with people this year , most of the most urgent need . &quot;
&quot; thus the plan to write letters of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , which now will find their place in society and will need to build a new life . &quot; &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discour@@ se from a war history to a common history of peace . &quot;
&quot; so far , within the framework of the campaign was collected more than 2000 letters . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia like Cal@@ i , Man@@ it@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á . &quot;
I never thought that someone would forgive me
the first 500 letters passed on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the region of Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca .
&quot; a group of 40 students from the University of J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ al Auth@@ orities of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Stiftung Bog@@ ot@@ Art traveled to the camp to get the letters personally . &quot;
the members of the F@@ ARC placed themselves on how they had done earlier in order to take the prec@@ epts of their leaders .
&quot; but this time they received no prec@@ epts , but letters of mal@@ nour@@ ishing of people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings you can walk in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in @-@ between , told the politicians of Manuela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later . &quot;
Sandra Par@@ ra is an assistant of the Gover@@ ning of the Province of Valle del Cau@@ ca for this unforgettable experience :
&quot; after we passed the letters , I conducted a former fighters in the camp of the Gu@@ er@@ illa fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ak@@ ler live ) , I saw a gu@@ ill@@ ator , who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I had fear to go down , because beside him on the bed it was a M@@ GL @-@ pom@@ eg@@ ress , a deadly weapon in the Dorn@@ red@@ dish sheep . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless I talked to him and asked : &quot; &quot; hello , what do they say right ? &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; I rep@@ lied to a letter I wrote me someone . &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never in my life someone wrote something so nice , so I was looking forward to it . &quot;
I h@@ ug@@ ged him firm and put me next to the gran@@ at@@ light .
&quot; perhaps he was sorry , was sorry to be all the years of faithful companion of this struggles , and wanted to help him write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he never expected anything else from life than war . join the F@@ ARC , was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers before hunger . &quot; &quot; I would never thought that someone would forgive myself for my mistakes . &quot;
&quot; but now I know that there is a society out there , who is waiting for us with open arms . &quot;
&quot; until now , I just learned how to handle weapons . &quot;
&quot; but now where peace re@@ igns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; for pre@@ lu@@ de , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came together to a discussion . &quot;
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC already carried out in the conc@@ e@@ fold .
&quot; therefore the leaders of the F@@ ARC the history of the organization , their ide@@ als and gave an insight into their views on the peace process : for many years , we have experienced how the social un@@ righteousness from the state on all the Colom@@ bian people , we can help us to create the society in this country . &quot;
&quot; for a goal of this size , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them . &quot;
Manuela was impressed :
&quot; to hear these people who have never heard before and had no choice , and to recognize that people who were often seen as monsters and even hate , even people with beautiful feelings were circum@@ cis@@ ed by their living conditions and their environment , was very painful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality , in which the country lives , does hur@@ ry me . &quot;
&quot; but it comfor@@ ted me that all men - even those who have killed and so much damage , we can bring something and give a smile and a hug . &quot;
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
&quot; Gust@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , the comm@@ ander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Archbishop of the City of Cal@@ i , the following letter : &quot;
Kolum@@ bi@@ ans was proph@@ esi@@ ed that after the dis@@ ar@@ ming peace would reign .
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as it is inequality , hunger and a lack of education , health care and employment opportunities there will always be people who are ready to attack weapons , and for their rights to protest . and this is totally justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we run by the F@@ ARC now at peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; therefore , we call all def@@ enders of peace - regardless of which race , religion or ideology they belong to them - to rise above all that of a country in war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifice , because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those among us who defend life as the basis of existence , will im@@ min@@ ate many difficulties . &quot;
&quot; on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual and que@@ er people who live in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region , are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and corruption . &quot;
&quot; with hor@@ rors , activi@@ sts have experienced the reporting of recent months on the persecution of pregnant men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; but the threat , which is like an Dam@@ o@@ cle@@ tian , above the dor@@ m LGB@@ T@@ Q church , is not only formed by night . &quot;
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a trans@@ sexual woman , who shared some of their experiences with us and talked about what is happening in the republic . &quot;
&quot; the LGB@@ T@@ Q humor in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has been conquered several months ago as the international head@@ lines , after reports published , which sp@@ ends torture , torture and killing que@@ er men in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; the first report was released by the journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gas@@ eta ; they cast a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities , the susp@@ ected que@@ er men soli@@ ds and put them in secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun . &quot;
&quot; they have brought a mon@@ ster to the world &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ woman , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
ever since her childhood she sen@@ sed her that she was a woman in reality .
&quot; when it was growing , you became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for them , why she moved to Moscow . &quot;
after a group was experienced by the sex @-@ equation of their land@@ lady , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina . &quot;
&quot; for fear of her life , they went to the US last year . &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I worked as an honorary hel@@ per in a human rights organization .
one day was told me that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a famili@@ y from D@@ ag@@ est@@ an , a trans@@ wife that cont@@ agi@@ ous in trouble . &quot;
&quot; it had no money , so I took it without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , did someone out of which I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them anywhere on the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his ch@@ ech@@ enia friends , with the following message : &quot; &quot; then there are no men more in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can eliminate these shame ? &quot;
&quot; after that , the photos of my documents made the round of W@@ hat@@ s@@ App the round . &quot;
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; when I just got to get a few shopping with the back of my car , I heard a men &apos;s voice : &quot; here is a gift for you by your un@@ cle . &quot;
&quot; when I turned off , I sen@@ sed something in my body , but I did nothing wrong . &quot;
&quot; then I heard one set , but this time in the Che@@ chen : &quot; how long will you still honor the family , you sn@@ ake ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
&quot; I just know that there was a young man , no 30 years old . &quot;
then I lost consciousness and wo@@ ke up the final end in the hospital again .
apparently some women had gotten everything and started to cry .
the man was escap@@ ed .
the women had a nur@@ se .
in the hospital I learned that I had two key@@ ring in my right pul@@ pit .
OC Media : what hospitals have been placed - in which men or women ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name dr@@ auf ; but the doctor arose and put me on the women . &quot;
that is why I am very grateful for this .
&quot; when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I got it with fear ; it was a mus@@ cular , a Muslim name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am thankful to him that he is respect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month in hospital .
last February I got a threat .
&quot; they called me , wrote me - relatives , stran@@ gers , some completely unknown . &quot;
this was the beginning of a nigh@@ tm@@ are .
my family was attended by neighbors and some distant relatives .
required to return to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that all was a lie .
&quot; they placed absur@@ de demands : some told me , I must prove it by going up without the streets , others wanted that I was not changed at the official television in Gros@@ ny and say that I was not changed my gender , that everything was just bad , and Photoshop . &quot;
I have grain size C - what could I say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it is still hard for them .
some older people were talking to my mother on the road .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; You have brought a mon@@ ster to the world that not only your family , but the whole republic has been ashamed . &quot;
&quot; we can not stir@@ red you , because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
my mother became too much and she lay a stri@@ ck around the neck .
luck@@ ily the neighbors and saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later stood under the window a car with broken window windows and a number@@ ing plate with a 95 dr@@ on .
once it happened for the third time I was clear that there was something la@@ zy .
my dear friends @-@ ups of the number@@ ing signs - it turned out that I was persec@@ uted .
OC Media : how are you escap@@ ed ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activi@@ sts .
&quot; for security reasons I want to make their name inexpensive , but I want to say that I remember it all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with her help I left the country , but then something was something un@@ credi@@ ble . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
just before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
&quot; I bought it without register without notice , without notice , without anything . &quot;
I cr@@ ush my old SIM card and cast it into the gar@@ bage .
arrived and check@@ te into the hotel .
the number was registered on a stran@@ ger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; in the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you think not about , you warm@@ est in security , just because you leave the country ? &quot;
&quot; our people already know , in what hotel you do . you even know your room number . &quot;
just to prove it : it is the number 115 .
can you imagine ? !
this was in fact my room number .
OC Media : do you still get in touch with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; however , we do not talk about the sex equation , this is a tabby issue . &quot;
some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements I still have in me .
&quot; as much as I wish , this se@@ el@@ ic barrier can I not overcome . &quot;
&quot; I am saying that , as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with camera , I actually give me trouble to look like the person who reminds them out of their past - thus to my male form . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends do , those who have stayed there ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I have submitted a report in Washington last week .
for the required I need current information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; I spoke with someone , the one @-@ half months in Ar@@ gun . &quot;
&quot; he told that during the Ram@@ adan there were no people arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he closed a new wave . &quot;
most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives .
&quot; with that , my I , they probably load the relatives , these take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end require a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; honor &quot; &quot; experienced by blood satisfaction . &quot;
OC Media : will now also be held pregnant men in these secrecy ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says it was not very many .
&quot; if , then above all those who have no weal@@ thy relatives , or those of their relatives were dropped to ask for Kad@@ y@@ rows Court . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they will be held there , so that you can present them later than terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say , they should be converted , one will show off their bodies on TV and claim them , they could have attacked your village or military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not simply disappeared , but specifically under@@ sur@@ faced , to radi@@ ate himself . &quot;
OC Media : is this now just a mut@@ ation or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just have someone who had one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; he says that many people disappeared in this prison , after their beard had grown . &quot;
there have been nothing new from them .
they simply have taken them .
&quot; and this so called Lord , this person was himself involved , when these people were taken away . &quot;
&quot; however , they were not presented as band@@ its , in addition there were no reports yet . we susp@@ ect that such actions are quite possible . &quot;
why would it not have allowed these people to shave yourself ?
&quot; know if these persec@@ utions and ab@@ duc@@ tions of people , who belong to a so called &quot; non@@ traditional &quot; orientation , already in the past ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I was my hair always long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I believe that in 2003 I was already known to Gros@@ ny as I lived there - and I never had any problems .
at Ernst !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when the shar@@ ia was considered , I never had any problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , at that time it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia originally wanted to rise to the &quot; &quot; civi@@ liz@@ ations &quot; , &quot; finally , ultimately has returned to the St@@ one@@ age . &quot;
OC Media : how is this under the shar@@ ia law possible ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were stain@@ ed ; I had colored eyelashes , carried tu@@ be@@ je@@ ans and short T@@ ops . &quot;
the security of the mystery of the Sch@@ aria has never put me only a hair .
&quot; in front of the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people met me . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several ben@@ ches were standing , and all the city knew ; they knew why men , young people , there met . &quot;
we were never revi@@ ved .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a speech : Khar@@ da ma Khar@@ da . that means : &quot; Sp@@ are not about the hurt of another . &quot;
&quot; it is often said to children , if they are funny about sick . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : so simply have their eyes closed before you , because they believed , you are sick ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never revi@@ ved me never hun@@ ted and never be@@ aten .
OC Media : how long did this grace time kept up ?
Sab@@ rina : as long as Kad@@ y@@ row stood on the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed Minister for Prime Minister , he started to talk on TV on mor@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; he did not speak about us by se , but mainly on the behaviour of women . &quot;
nevertheless - you could feel how the people in the city began to change .
&quot; who previously worked and gel@@ e , I looked at once with Arg@@ ie . &quot;
in the time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel how the situation in the Republic has been growing steadily . &quot;
OC Media : what activity go you now by ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I won &apos;t get a lot - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the US not much .
&quot; apart from that , I am still working as a acti@@ vis@@ as . &quot;
&quot; currently , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women . &quot;
I join them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize teac@@ ups , meetings , I go back to the hospital and help them to get involved . &quot;
I do not accept c@@ ents for a long time .
I discovered these people himself when I dism@@ iss the hi@@ ding place .
I am Muslims and wants to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you have a Hid@@ de@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : this is al@@ mm@@ ed .
so the nature that has purely nothing to do with religion .
&quot; this is exactly the same as Cher@@ e@@ ez@@ ebox , who want to make you wel@@ ded with foam before the mouth , that there are no oscill@@ ating co@@ ils . &quot;
&quot; the D@@ ag@@ est@@ ans have which , the Kab@@ ardin@@ ers have which , the Russians also have which ; on the whole planet there is it - but not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; I come from there , that &apos;s why it is unpleasant for me to hear . &quot;
I come here so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
&quot; many of them - practicing Muslims , who go into the mosque and during the Ram@@ adan , live together with men . &quot;
&quot; know , many think about Tran@@ si@@ denti@@ ty men , men love , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different types of sensation , to be accurate , different ways of life . &quot;
for me it is the most important to feel me in my own skin and not ashamed of my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
sorry that I will be so personal here but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago .
and I am not at all sad for it - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups war@@ n against an increase of self @-@ mor@@ ality within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran
the Ira@@ qi Ah@@ wa@@ z region is suffering from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and ar@@ ine@@ al rate within the native Arab population .
since the last few months there has been a strong increase from self @-@ mor@@ den .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in T@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; the self @-@ burning of a man called J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August , the des@@ perate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran , which is dominated by poverty and unemployment , in the spot@@ light . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married , and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the South@@ west of Iran in the South@@ west of Iran . &quot;
&quot; he l@@ itt out of anxiety , depression , and he sh@@ ame@@ ful for his own hel@@ pl@@ essness that may arise in@@ ability for his family , so Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; one on YouTube shared video kept the moments , after having rep@@ lied himself . &quot;
&quot; some people managed to clear the fl@@ ames again , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought into the Tal@@ eg@@ h@@ ani hospital in the town of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; according to local sources , the com@@ bus@@ tion were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more . &quot;
he died short time later .
&quot; it was not the only su@@ icide , which has happened in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i minority , and activi@@ sts before , that even more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights announces that this month some other - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sh@@ ah@@ ab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - attached . &quot;
&quot; their stories have one thing in common : there were all family v@@ ä@@ ter who felt thanks to the persecution by the Iranian government , hel@@ pl@@ ess and in@@ able to feed their families and to work on a safe work . &quot;
Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
&quot; the region , where most of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community is based in the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community , has been sh@@ aken from a profound economic crisis which makes it tough to climb up to the native Arab population . &quot;
&quot; in front of a century , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predomin@@ antly autonom@@ ous region in Iran , until the P@@ ahl@@ avi @-@ monarchy took over power and 1925 big efforts made to stop ethnic autonomy throughout Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest in Iran in the coming oil and gas fields as well as some of the rich@@ est and most valuable commercial areas for the Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite this valuable resources , the regional economy will continue to develop slowly and the local population get little of this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often the victim of untreated diseases , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the Ira@@ qi regime denied the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Arabs systematically in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry . &quot;
&quot; the government has also built a variety of da@@ ms , the waters of the Arab areas into the Persian areas where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , K@@ erman and Gh@@ om . &quot;
&quot; these dem@@ ons have only led to destro@@ ying the devast@@ ation in the region by drying , and local agriculture , as well as the fish and palms industry . &quot;
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ ha@@ w@@ zi adolesc@@ ents has now increased to 81 % .
&quot; NO@@ UR Moh@@ ammed P@@ ur , the Ira@@ chief executive director of co@@ oper@@ atives , work and social welfare , mel@@ ted that 5 % of the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is , which have completed a job , finished at 55 % a secondary school and 45 % have a university degree . &quot;
systematic strategy ... that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance
&quot; Kar@@ im Doh@@ im@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist eth@@ ni@@ cal discrimination &quot; , &quot; to a &quot; high rise &quot; the number of self @-@ mor@@ den among the young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ men . &quot;
Doh@@ im@@ i said that especially unemployment has become worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of in Ah@@ wa@@ z new ethnic Per@@ sians and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the creation process :
&quot; because functional and institutions preferred not to be an Arab workforce , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i will be educated in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs , and to force them to earn their livel@@ ih@@ ood outside their homeland . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to hide their preferences and surname to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i and so an@@ ew , since even Arab names are not toler@@ ated , because the speaking of the Arabic language or the tr@@ ages Arab clothing . &quot;
&quot; given the given circumstances which must end@@ ure the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i , propose human rights activ@@ ist alarm , before the location explo@@ si@@ v . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world is awake and aware of it .
the main reason for su@@ icide is indisp@@ utable .
depression is treat@@ able and su@@ icide is avoi@@ dable .

&quot; the following article is an updated version of the opinion that was published by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i , originally published on the website Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . the article was subject of several discussions in which many different positions have expressed . &quot;
you can read in the comments under the original text .
&quot; when I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , react many women - especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ als femin@@ ists - with fru@@ stration . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put a well @-@ thought scientific and social arguments against me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we generally be all femin@@ ist * inside .
&quot; for example , women nowadays are still less money in spite of equal education than men . &quot;
&quot; that women are still under strict observation , if it is about what they may do with their body . &quot;
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women have come before or later in various areas of life on a g@@ ä@@ b blank@@ et , and that discrimination based on sex still passes through the many different countries and fai@@ ths . &quot;
all this is aware of me and well @-@ known .
I am convinced and I will be double and triple below .
I am a black woman .
&quot; and yet : if I have to speak on skin colour , on racism , on black ro@@ ud , on black women in the LGB@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I have been considering how we have always talked about seg@@ reg@@ ation and discrimination , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , have been conf@@ isc@@ ated many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ iors of femin@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; but nevertheless all agree that women - all women should come together to up@@ lift their votes and &apos; K@@ umb@@ aya , my Lord &quot; to sing &quot; to reach the equality ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t want to talk about that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence an institu@@ tion@@ alized form of racial violence gives , that we are exposed to black women in two different ways . &quot;
&quot; or above , black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cs , and of origin , less than white men and women . &quot;
&quot; that black girls and girls with a migration background of the school are referred to as white girls , due to obvious integr@@ ations problems . &quot;
&quot; or that women are exposed in black spheres , and women with a migration background of a higher risk to suffer domestic violence and violence in the partnership , than white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , I want all the women , all men and all humans have neither skin colour the same rights ; but on the other hand I can not consider myself as black woman in their centre , which may refuse the white woman who refers both to the gender and the skin colour of a person . &quot;
&quot; I am exhausted , and I will no longer fight for my membership in a white @-@ femin@@ istic @-@ oriented don@@ key , who always rejected me and inn@@ umer@@ ated other black women and over again . &quot;
&quot; so@@ jour@@ ner conf@@ isc@@ ated in 18@@ 51 in their speech : &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; and also I refuse to maintain an ideology , in which the black woman in historical respects is a terrible and margin@@ alized nature . &quot;
&quot; I refuse to join myself , group@@ ings me group@@ ings , which also absor@@ b our customs and customs to advance its eg@@ oc@@ entri@@ c programme . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer try to specify white women the importance of over@@ cutting of skin colour and gender . because some of them will continue to mention the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to bel@@ ung a better . &quot;
&quot; although the inter@@ se@@ k@@ tion@@ ale femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different people a home and dis@@ borders from white femin@@ ism , is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in his name . &quot;
&quot; I prefer to fix me full of femin@@ ism and bringing me the motion of the W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was declared for my dark skin and my status as a woman , which is so stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon . &quot;
&quot; now it is more important than ever , that we define black women in our own ideas and set us into the spheres , which are created by us for us . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of Afri@@ cana wom@@ anism : rec@@ oll@@ im@@ ing ourselves ( e.g. : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we can withdraw ourselves against our own way , in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , past@@ el , physical and even the spiritual elements can im@@ itate the black woman . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ se@@ k@@ tion@@ ale femin@@ ists immediately call for separ@@ atism and exclusion after they have read these lines , please inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected . &quot;
in a wom@@ an@@ ist environment I can asc@@ end black women and women of other cultures because this paradig@@ m exist .
I will be recognized as part of this paradig@@ m due to my dark skin and because of my existence as a part of this paradig@@ m .
&quot; I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment in which my life neither passed , nor ignored . &quot;
loung@@ ing against the pollution : the man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
&quot; this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ el was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reported in@@ particular about international efforts to solve environmental problems . &quot;
as part of a content sharing agreement this article will once again be published .
&quot; again , Nab@@ il Mus@@ a in the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a special concern by the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in Iraq . its mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations . &quot;
&quot; in this documentation of Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , we follow Mus@@ a that explains us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution by its community . &quot;
&quot; I really wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child , &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , construction of shr@@ ubs , pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - who is committed to protecting rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq as well as local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summar@@ izes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; &quot; if we had no water anymore , how would we survive ? &quot;
&quot; this video was produced for En@@ sia by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bil , produced in Iraq and m@@ ultim@@ edi@@ al journ@@ alism , fil@@ med and published . &quot;
&quot; the focus of their work lies on persec@@ uted , little resp@@ ectable sub@@ cultures and distingu@@ ishes itself through the use of cooperative video and new m@@ ultim@@ edi@@ al techniques , with their help oppressed communities to tell their stories about their way . &quot;

the following article is the abri@@ d@@ ged and processed version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # soft women ) which reported about violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed for the protection of the persons concerned .
&quot; Ar@@ da B@@ á@@ ez said to A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , that she had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , its ex@@ partners who has become violent against violent . &quot;
&quot; since the end of their relationship was a little time passed and the police said , their statement would be placed to the acts , but more could not do . &quot;
&quot; as another woman of Bal@@ bu@@ ena , because of abuse , the ac@@ ed@@ ingly display of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez did nothing . &quot;
a few days later the second woman went back to the ad .
breaking the devil @-@ circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women are given at all notice , they generally receive no support from the state . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women also depend on the men that they mis@@ ses . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence at all at all at the prosec@@ ution authorities . &quot;
&quot; contents and Statisti@@ cs 2 In@@ visible Mis@@ sions , and a legal system , which is not contrac@@ t@@ 3 of Paraguay laws : good approach , def@@ ective implementation and statistics
&quot; it &apos;s hard to determine how many women really will be mis@@ leading , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , resear@@ cher for gen@@ der@@ enquiries at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aci@@ ón y E@@ studios , a soci@@ ologist research institution in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; there are various statements and reports , which however do not even indicate the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; however , the numbers available are however al@@ ar@@ ming . &quot;
in 2015 there were at the District Apostle 9@@ 600 indicators for domestic violence . at 70 % of it it was about violence against women .
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 ads because of domestic violence among peace matters . also here stood 86 % of the ads of women .
&quot; in the ads , 40 % of women were said that they were physically mis@@ led , 55 % of the women were spoken of psych@@ ic failure . &quot;
but these statistics do not show the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay .
&quot; according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Women of Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only few of these crimes are actually displayed . &quot; on any woman , which will be re@@ imb@@ urs@@ ed in Paraguay because of mental mis@@ tic display , 9 women who do not do this . &quot;
&quot; every woman who will be ref@@ unded on every woman who do not refund any two women who do not do this , &quot; stated at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; because the su@@ icide in Paraguay is not a private crime , the criminal prosec@@ ution may not be appropri@@ ately documented as many women were mur@@ dered by their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; alone until August 2016 , journalists have at least 12 cases of women in the land alone . &quot;
the coordin@@ ator of human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were mur@@ dered by their current or former partners .
&quot; according to their estimates , in Paraguay all ten days a woman dies because of violence by men . &quot;

invisible missions and a legal system that accepts nothing
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z was the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she called his name to all of her former friends . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning they didn &apos;t want that , but then there was still . this should she always rep@@ ented . &quot;
&quot; today , Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos together . but two years it carried out the psychological violence against women , and at the same time the most severe forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severe recogni@@ zable : &quot;
I never thought that I would become victims of abuse .
&quot; when I read earlier , I always thought that the only women happens to be under@@ ne@@ yed because they f@@ ool from violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that this would never happen .
Mari@@ ana us@@ te social media to report on the mis@@ ery by Carlos Vera .
&quot; without name , they wrote articles on fac@@ ebook , in which they described its ins@@ ults and various attacks during their two years @-@ old relationship and told how he had ins@@ ulated it . &quot;
&quot; many people responding to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic , whether he ever asked the hand against them , and ref@@ used to admit that his behaviour was also a form of mis@@ carriage . &quot;
other Facebook @-@ users asked Mari@@ ana why she liked the so long of Carlos and had not left him before .
&quot; it seemed almost like , as they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least a certain compassion . &quot;
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , which dates not from Paraguay , fought nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay , to prove that their former partners mis@@ led them . &quot;
&quot; Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o @-@ CRE@@ O network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) , which consists of women who are all in any way victims of abuse . &quot;
&quot; in the group , they can speak with others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
you do what many others do not do : you take the statements of women seriously .
in Vic@@ tori@@ as case everything started with psych@@ ic missions .
&quot; your weal@@ thy partner succeeded even to convince them , that she was worth@@ less . &quot;
then he started to beat her .
&quot; Vic@@ tori@@ as advertisements in the authorities remained without a result , and also of their relatives , she received no support . &quot;
&quot; it carried out a process against its former partners who developed into an irre@@ ver@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and influence of their former partner . &quot;
&quot; Paraguay &apos;s laws , good approach , poor implementation &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but not being applied . &quot;
&quot; the display of abuse is a path full of resist@@ ors and a fight against corruption in the judiciary , &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organization for Women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ian Parliament was discussed a bill introduced under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ el@@ las ( # Für@@ th ) . &quot;
&quot; this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # non @-@ Less ) are part of a campaign on Twitter , which is supported by Am@@ nest@@ y International . &quot;
the original acc@@ us@@ ation of the law seems to explain and pen@@ alize Fem@@ izi@@ d to a stand @-@ standing off@@ ence and pun@@ ished as it is already in the neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; so , the legisl@@ ator was changed in some points to also win the members of the law that are fear@@ ed the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions , which is currently being banned in Paraguay , and can be pun@@ ished with up to five years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the original bill was envis@@ aged , most of the ( bureaucr@@ atic and economic ) proc@@ ed@@ ural costs that have to carry out the victims of violence at present themselves , if they just provide an indication and wish to receive safe accommodation , the state . &quot;
&quot; Ech@@ au@@ ri argu@@ ed that the Law is not effective unless legislation does not provide adequate financial resources for this : &quot;
in Paraguay will be seen as part of human relationships .
&quot; here , a re@@ thinking must take place , so that violence is no longer regarded as something standards . &quot;
&quot; whoever talks about this facts , makes himself guilty and contributes to the perpet@@ rators of perpet@@ rators . &quot;
we have to refund as long as you have not considered normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Sen@@ at . previously , parts of the law was modified . however , among other things , one passage was painted , which called the partners in cases of domestic violence against reconciliation . &quot;
the opinions on changes are going apart .
the section on reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for ag@@ gres@@ sor to attack his sacrifice .
&quot; the submission of words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; of parts of the law shall be considered a great return . &quot;

independent media in O@@ man launched a year after a ban on paper
&quot; this website was locked to read on the website of the Information Bank of Information &quot; &quot; is published on the homepage of the Forbidden newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
more than one year ago the om@@ anic authorities have closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of its coverage about corruption in the sult@@ ancy .
&quot; You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison , where he is hi@@ ked a year ago . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and put in court , later they came again free . &quot;
&quot; O@@ man has been ruled by the Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us ib@@ n S@@ aid that came to power after he had his father , S@@ aid ib@@ n T@@ aim@@ ur , by a state of state . &quot;
&quot; since then he dres@@ sed , in addition to his role as the only Sultan , the most important branches in the country : Prime Minister , Defence Minister , Minister Minister , Minister of Minister , Foreign Minister , President of the Supreme Council for planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the rule of sult@@ ans is characterized by the influ@@ ential effort of security forces , especially domestic secrets , public freedoms , including freedom of freedom , limit@@ ing and human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blog@@ gers and other activi@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; the authorities limit peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights systematically and hin@@ dering citizens , even activi@@ sts , to express their views on public affairs of the country such as corruption in authorities and institutions , both online and offline . &quot;
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and the imprisonment three of their editors in the last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country . &quot;
&quot; Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , in which since its foundation 2007 , corruption in O@@ man ( an absolute monarchy ) was reported until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , was firmly re@@ published in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 . in this it was about corruption in the judiciary and the interference of high @-@ level officials in judicial decisions . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government decre@@ ed acc@@ used to set judges of the Supreme Court in O@@ man under pressure , to stand up a judgment in an inheritance . &quot;
&quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n of 26 July 2016 , with a report on the front page with the title : &quot; high @-@ level parties bind the hands of the judiciary . &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , Member of the board committee , loaded from the ISS before the special department and took place upon his arrival by the security forces . &quot;
on 9 August 2016 the ISS invited the dep@@ uty @-@ chief editor You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j who had acts to Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is ar@@ capture as editor @-@ in @-@ chief .
&quot; the paper was closed at un@@ certain time after the information sm@@ ini@@ ster had given the directive , that &quot; the publication and spread of the paper on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 trial was held in Mas@@ kat the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i . &quot;
the Court condemned the three journalists to prison quarters and also suggested the final closure of the newspaper .
&quot; Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j , both among other things were condemned because of the dis@@ ruption of public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; sub@@ ordination of the pres@@ tige of the State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty of the violation of an audience &apos;s ban and re@@ ass@@ ination .
Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years of rest and money exchange in the amount of 3000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . moreover a one @-@ year @-@ standing profession was raised against the two journalists .
&quot; Al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year of prison and an ATM of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) , after having been able to represent a threat to the distribution of material that could be a threat to public order &quot; . &quot; &quot;
for Al @-@ Abr@@ i a deposit was set up in the amount of 5000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) and he was released on 22 August 2016 before the judgment of the imprisonment .
&quot; the Ap@@ pe@@ al Court said Al @-@ Abr@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , distributed Al @-@ Ha@@ j , but one year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari for six months of prison . &quot;
&quot; Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 following the feed @-@ in of its six@@ teen ar@@ gue . Al @-@ Ha@@ j continues to be in prison , where he viol@@ ates his sentence . &quot;
the Ap@@ pe@@ al Court also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Information on the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; despite the decision of the court , Az@@ am@@ n again , the paper shows itself exposed to the attacks by the om@@ anic government . &quot;
on 8 January the information sm@@ ini@@ ster sent a directive with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was renewed for three months .
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the information sm@@ ini@@ ster personally signed a further statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was renewed for three additional months , and the minister presented itself once again against the decision of the Ap@@ pe@@ dago@@ gues , publication of the newspaper . &quot;
the continuous closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where in O@@ man was viol@@ ated the press freedom .
&quot; for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to stop its operation . &quot;
&quot; due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the imprisonment of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ anic authorities are still not ready to prepare the extensive violation of the press freedom . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the om@@ anic authorities on : &quot;
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j promptly and un@@ condi@@ tionally release ;
2 . create a safe environment for the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper so that their journalists can go back to their job ;
3 . protect the freedom of the press in the country and
&quot; 4 . under all circumstances make sure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in O@@ man can imp@@ ose their right human rights work , and without any fear of failure , including judicial action . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization , the human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , log@@ ers , law@@ yers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighboring countries by promoting the opinion and association , and the right to gather peaceful , and provide protection . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ under@@ standings
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ ors 2016 in Zambia , figure takes place with his acceptance
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or at all times . this is a growing area that is one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
&quot; for the need for a leading medical research there are two reasons : for a lack of medicines and vacc@@ ines , which cover the special medical need on the African continent . &quot;
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis and mal@@ aria have far grave impact than elsewhere , and lack of investment in research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem . &quot;
&quot; secondly , research that is carried out by African scientists in Africa . a major role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ ors is director of the Central Research Center in Zambia ( Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS @-@ epide@@ mic first serious impact on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for a study in the United States , first in Louis@@ iana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania he made himself the HIV virus , before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ b@@ arian health system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. Warri@@ ors on the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ under@@ standings of the media about these research . &quot;
( disclaimer : Dr. Warri@@ er speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ ors R@@ W : at the moment the focus of my work on the application of research results . in doing so I support the sam@@ b@@ arian national programme for anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
&quot; in addition , I joined a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ ogen@@ s . &quot;
AG@@ A : what are your opinion about the important current academic themes in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
r@@ w : there is no basic research here . we only put solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; this must change , otherwise we will always stay recei@@ vers instead of being bl@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that we get are often used in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use it here . &quot;
GV : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is to find suitable scientists for projects ?
r@@ w : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are very well supported .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or want to come here , because the financing and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot;
GV : how is the research infrastructure ?
which obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not had before ?
r@@ w : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
GV : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
&quot; r@@ w : there are already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods . &quot;
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods are taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; AG@@ A : how large is your opinion on the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on , and how can we support the development ? &quot;
r@@ w : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there are need for specific scientific training , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer science , big data , research of space , the healthcare sector ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ agi@@ ous diseases ) , and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it . &quot;
AG@@ A : can you describe the pros and cons of Life as scientist in Africa in relation to Western countries based on your experience ?
&quot; r@@ w : often , it is the limited speed , things to do , and the clear@@ ing access to scientific expertise that present here challenges . &quot;
&quot; the system that magazines make articles accessible only against payment ( the so called &quot; &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , &quot; also limited the amount of information and the speed of research . &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed manufacturers change worldwide food production
&quot; this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that covers solutions for environmental problems worldwide . &quot;
Frank Mor@@ ton has been bre@@ d in the USA since the 1980s .
&quot; his company offers 114 sorts , such as out@@ red@@ ness , the first plant that has grown by NASA @-@ ast@@ ron@@ aut in space and consumed . &quot;
&quot; almost 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was done only through its own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question , how many sal@@ at@@ balls he can get limits . &quot;
&quot; but in the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noted that more and more sal@@ ads were patented and that he could not continue to use them further . &quot;
&quot; the patents are not only used for individual varieties , but also for certain properties like resi@@ li@@ ence to diseases , a special red or green leaf . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , more and more such patents have been filed on more plants such as cer@@ eals or cardboard boxes . due to this trend , plant bree@@ ders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and expert for food security are provided for the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia tradition , Mor@@ ton is still salad , he still needs more , since its work is more and more efficient than ever more limitations . &quot;
&quot; it is , as would lie in a river a rock bread that I have to pull . &quot;
&quot; so we must now make that now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; I think that these patents go on sal@@ ads too far . &quot;
&quot; and if they with@@ stand in court , no one can breed any new sal@@ at@@ sor@@ te because all features are already patented , and tries to fres@@ hen those features that he wants . &quot;
&quot; however , it is very careful and stri@@ ves to use no material that is being protected as a intellectual property . &quot;
he is also connected to a movement that is becoming increasingly bigger in the US and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; ) .

it is no coinci@@ dence that this name rather sounds like this would origin@@ ate from the IT department and not from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; -@@ seed ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; Open Source Software &quot; software that provides alternatives to copyright protected software .
&quot; it was established in life to ensure that some plant species and gene are not protected as intellectual property and are thus usable for plant bree@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; in the context of the initiative , shortly Ossi , US bree@@ ders can also commit themselves to freely use the seed of them . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed , and they can sell it . &quot; open source &quot; &quot; bre@@ eder only allow others to breed their seed , and it is not immediately out - two aspects that are prohibited by many plant pat@@ ente or prescribed . &quot;
do@@ z@@ ens of bree@@ ders and seed @-@ owned companies have already joined the initiative since its start in 2014 .
to be glo@@ omy prospects
&quot; for the em@@ eri@@ ed Professor of the University of Wis@@ cons@@ in @-@ Ma@@ dison and Ossi manager , Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control of the seed and the opportunity to breed new plants , both important for nutrition security and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; seed takes him a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bree@@ ders would try to not use the latter or only little by doing seed with natural resi@@ li@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stressed that the &quot; open source &quot; movement does not work with gene@@ tically modified plants . &quot;
&quot; all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , cor@@ ds , gene@@ tically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; to obtain our objective of ecological sustainability , we need control over the mer@@ gers of chemical China and Syn@@ gent@@ a and mon@@ san@@ to and Bayer who wants to buy good , locally and sustainable manufacturing vegetables , how it is bre@@ d for example , like this vegetable is bre@@ d . &quot;
dietary sou@@ ver@@ ge without seed @-@ sou@@ ver@@ ism is not possible . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed initiative are committed to providing others their seed , and in contrast , their actions are in contrast to pat@@ ently , seed and plant characteristics . &quot;

&quot; Ossi @-@ supporters ar@@ gue that the future of food supplies is je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed , since the available gen@@ pool due to the ever more numerous intellectual property rights in plant material , which therefore always be subject to tan@@ gible . &quot;
&quot; Claire Lu@@ by , Executive director of Ossi , has worked in her PhD thesis with genetic variation when car@@ r@@ ots and their availability . she found out that about a third of all card @-@ characteristics were protected as a intellectual property , allowing it to be used for plant bree@@ ders either at all or only . &quot;
&quot; for other plants there is such estimates not yet , but experts like Lu@@ by ver@@ aging that mass @-@ grown plants as wheat in an even bigger style are patented as salad or car@@ r@@ ots . &quot;
a question of view
plants are bre@@ d that they have targeted features - from those who have improved their taste or colour to those due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bree@@ ders due to more and more patents go . genetic diversity is currently being unnecessary than ever since the changed conditions due to climate change are far worse predic@@ table .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ Spe@@ aker Car@@ ly S@@ ca@@ du@@ to that genetic diversity is generally important and also vital for Mon@@ san@@ tos activities . with a total of four com@@ bus@@ banks and cooperation with institutions such as the agricultural Ministry of Economic Affairs and the United States . &quot;
&quot; however , it contradi@@ cts that intellectual property other bre@@ eder supplies , since &quot; patents and the protection of crop protection products &quot; . &quot; a patent is basically a plan that can be followed once the patent expi@@ red . &quot;
often these instructions help others to come with another method to get the same result .
&quot; this means that such protection is not inhi@@ bited , but does not promote innovation by providing the public more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ ton looks that different : 20 years to wait until a patent application , is certainly not innovations . &quot;
&quot; and if you have been waiting for a long time to breed , on plants that have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions if you have lost the struggle already . &quot;
&quot; however , the main point for Mor@@ ton is however that genetic resources have always been a general good and continue to remain : &quot; independent plant bree@@ ders have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ et@@ ary incentives are not attractive for us . &quot;
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; this is what motiv@@ ates us , and it won &apos;t be impossible if we are not able to continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; in total , Mor@@ ton has gu@@ ilt in the concept of itself , plant characteristics : &quot; we create the characteristics not really itself . &quot;
the plants make them out of and as a bre@@ eder we have no idea how the plants do that .
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding @-@ up in the U.S. state Oregon and Ossi managers , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; who has bre@@ d a sor@@ te , they also bre@@ d his own values into them . &quot;
&quot; who believes in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , in which cultivation of Her@@ bi@@ zi@@ de needs to be bre@@ d into its varieties of this concept of agriculture . &quot;
my concept is exactly un@@ ambiguous . &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that move in international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , they create the most smaller seed @-@ owned companies , even without patents to survive - either reject it for too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case . &quot;
the independent plant @-@ hand Frank Mor@@ ton is searching in his breeding garden Sal@@ ads .

&quot; Mor@@ ton is also the view that bre@@ eder through the prevention of plant pat@@ ent@@ ent of innovative would : &quot; &quot; it looks like me with my efforts to produce new , stronger than corporations , the patented . &quot;
&quot; I need to constantly sell new material for my catalogue , as I know that my competitors normally sell my varieties in a couple of years ago , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; with a patent you are 20 years ahead of competition , making it very nice just makes it very nice . &quot;
&quot; although the U.S. seem to be leaders in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept is now expanding , but quickly around the world . &quot;
&quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources , an &quot; open source &quot; seed program works in the center with farmers , and helps them to breed new varieties to meet certain requirements . &quot;
it also supports them to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; -@@ seed and sell their own .
&quot; the German organization Agre@@ col is working on an &quot; open source &quot; license which ultimately is a formal and legally binding form of Ossi @-@ obligation for bree@@ ders in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ( regulations for the bre@@ eder differ from country to country , that is not simply one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; in the beginning of November 2016 the executive powers of the European Union , the European Commission , declar@@ es that conventional plants should not be patented . thus , it speaks against the current practice of the European patent of patent , which permits patents on conventional plant breeding . &quot;
&quot; however , a statement is not yet a law ; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to put this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organisation Hi@@ v@@ os hosted a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; seed management banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed company from all East @-@ Africa to learn about the &quot; Open Source &quot; -@@ seed movement and the worldwide trend towards pat@@ enting seeds . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; Sa@@ at@@ gut@@ systeme , the organization currently creates a global alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; Sa@@ at@@ gut@@ systeme , for the planned next year of the official start@@ up . &quot;
&quot; a merger of environmental and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organization US@@ C Canada and the action group to ero@@ sion , technology and concentration - Action Group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation , compiled to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the Future of Food and other - a report published . it represents the view that farmers have to participate in seed , to communicate and improve the seed policy to ensure a stable supply of food supplies . &quot;
&quot; in the report , the importance of a diverse , local supply with seed @-@ good for sustainable food systems is stressed - a connection , by the Lu@@ by of Ossi that will soon be able to recognize him more people . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has always respected , where and how something grown , and seed systems have hardly ever played a role , so Lu@@ by . &quot; we are trying to make people clear that more behind their food . &quot;

human rights Organization and blog are the newest goals of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
still un@@ lock the Egyptian authorities on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ ni@@ sts .
&quot; on the weekend around the 05 @-@ August the Egyptian Government documents the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ H@@ RI ) , which documented human rights ab@@ uses in Egypt and the Arab world . &quot;
&quot; August published the network an opinion on Facebook , in which it critic@@ ised the Egyptian authorities for this step sharp and spoke to continue working and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; the Arabic Network for Human Rights inform@@ ation@@ - in spite of this attack and the mo@@ cking of the Egyptian Law and the constitution by the authorities to defend oneself every part of the world , even though it was never so difficult to overcome these objectives , so it was never as difficult as now . AN@@ H@@ RI , so it was never so difficult to overcome these objectives , so that all technical possibilities should be exhausted to overcome the block@@ age and do not re @-@ admit to it , to fulfill our task . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ H@@ RI is regarded as the first cen@@ sored website of a human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities forced more than two months 21 websites , Arabic @-@ speaking edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , and that from Qatar , by Al J@@ az@@ e@@ era due to the &quot; &quot; support of terrorism &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; in addition to AN@@ H@@ RI , in addition to AN@@ H@@ RI , Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada is no access to Egypt &apos;s blog . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada used his blog for the dissemination of columns and articles , which he does not write for in Egypt , not accessible web pages and media . &quot;
&quot; now , the blog he set up in order to deal with the cen@@ sus of the Egyptian government , the aim of an attack . &quot;
&quot; log@@ ger , the provider at which also Zi@@ adas blog is native , but on the other hand is further accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo of photo , spent nearly 500 days in cap@@ tivity when he reported in December 2013 by Egyptian security forces , while he reported a video about the student protests and took a video about the police of physical violence against two students . &quot;
his article is mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook review , Zi@@ ada expressed itself to the block@@ age by the government and reflected what this means for him : &quot;
&quot; the blogs to lock is very old , however , has a priority at the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi priority ; and even if the closure of the blogs might not be significant for the world , it is for two reasons for me : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It has succeeded to give me the feeling of an ins@@ ulator condition ; a sti@@ cking , a attempted murder , un@@ loading of the national Security Council , the block@@ age of blogs as well as any other website , for which I worked . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) You have proved that I was not in vain . in other words , my words have influence , even on a small audience . &quot;
I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
&quot; first , I used it to the post of articles in order to handle the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship . &quot;
&quot; however , after having lost him and that they have fear of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the mus@@ sels are going through the way up to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ u and Ex@@ pression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 . August 133 websites . these take technical tests in the networks of different Internet Service Provider ( ISP ) , e.g. Orange , Vo@@ da@@ fone and E@@ tis@@ al@@ at . &quot;
&quot; AF@@ TE also documented the block@@ age from providers , through the relocation of boarding @-@ c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and private surfing possible , so called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ PN@@ s ) &quot;
AF@@ TE reported in their research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12th , we noticed how the block@@ age of web pages that the V@@ PN@@ s started . &quot;
such practice points to the intention of the government to continue to block content and filter on the Egyptian user to have access to the Egyptian user .
&quot; the situation will additionally be wast@@ ed that the assur@@ ances were made behind closed doors , thereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis so that they can go against these actions against these actions . &quot;
now the question is : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with cen@@ sus and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants are dispute .

&quot; day of day reporting newspapers in all Brazil with dark head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous post boxes . &quot;
some of these lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old in school , &quot; &quot; Every@@ one second day is mur@@ dered a police be@@ am@@ ter in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; th@@ iev@@ es ro@@ b pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8500 soldiers of the army , nav@@ y and air conditioning to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the violence reached in Rio has been the highest stand for 10 years . &quot;
&quot; the Brazilian Government , Global Justice , even called the United Nations to interv@@ ene . &quot;
reports like these are all daily and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; this published the detailed report on violence in Rio known newspapers &quot; &quot; extra &quot; &quot; on 16 August the Edit@@ orial &quot; This is not normal &quot; , &quot; in which it announced a new heading called &quot; &quot; war in Rio &quot; . &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published .
the moti@@ fs for their decision explained the newspaper as follows :
&quot; extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in any major city on the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sex v@@ om@@ iting , etc . everything happens from civili@@ zed standard , and what happens only in Rio is published in the &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal ! &quot;
&quot; this is the only alternative , so that we as journalists do not close our eyes from cru@@ el@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; in a four @-@ heart@@ ed video that was shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio gu@@ edes , the Editor @-@ Chief of the newspaper that this decision was no cause for pride , but rather a sign of failure . &quot;
extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that does not recognise the war .
&quot; in the same video a journalist of the newspaper explains it according to the specifications of the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 territories , which are controlled by criminal organisations . &quot;
in the editorial article writes the newspaper further :
&quot; aware that a war discour@@ se , if it is distor@@ ted , even to be used , cru@@ ising the police , the first and then asked questions to forgive . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose objective is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the m@@ af@@ ia and its partners . &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; more than they use ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Bra@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira against it , the violence as &quot; war &quot; to describe their opinion after a justi@@ fication of the failed security policy through the media and could make it difficult to account responsibility in the police . &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and poor planning - how extra to show in the analysis of the care sets in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , clarification and a historical and self @-@ f@@ eit@@ y negl@@ ect of public service . &quot;
in memory : the federal state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than just its capital .

Rio de Janeiro considered the most violent place in Brazil is according to Cec@@ í@@ lia false : &quot; 22 of the 30 violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics of 2015 in the north and north @-@ east of the country . these are the latest data available .
none of these cities is in the State of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; if we look at the Mor@@ dr@@ ones per federal state , Rio to Place 16 , writes it . &quot;

&quot; among these safety policy measures also belon@@ ged to the foundation of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the federal state of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to con@@ quer a Fav@@ ela to con@@ quer a Fav@@ ela and permanently transfer a unit permanently there . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of violent deaths . for some years the U@@ PP has actually led to several reports about Sch@@ ik@@ anen and repres@@ sions against poor communities , which should actually protect the newly created police unit , increasingly under complaint . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , the journ@@ alist João Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux from one of his articles from 2010 , in which he explains why violence in Rio not declared - by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war &quot; . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio as war has also serious consequences for the human being . &quot;
&quot; for this calls on the state upon , means and paths that are typical of a war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a civil@@ isation is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and is an object for &quot; coll@@ ater@@ al damage &quot; and &quot; wast@@ ed balls &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; war , or her , Fak@@ her is that the inhabitants of the Fav@@ n in Rio continue to suffer . &quot;

&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the following civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal si@@ ege and block@@ ages , mainly through Assad regime towards loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to Siege Watch , a joint initiative of Peace Organization pax and the Forschungs@@ institut The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , D@@ ei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ lib currently about a million Syri@@ ans in a state of exposure . &quot;
&quot; the East Gh@@ out@@ a region , where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21st 2013 is called hundreds of civilians . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition go out , based on investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organizations that the mass@@ ac@@ re of Assad was exer@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these have been dependent on the re@@ bels areas outside of Damascus under si@@ ege , which led that inhabitants are dependent on local or through tun@@ nels and control points . &quot;
&quot; due to the years long block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat has become un@@ att@@ ain@@ able for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; it teaches a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and academ@@ ics , the inhabitants of Eastern Gh@@ out@@ as , as they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; &quot; life @-@ saving food source &quot; . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da and run the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; mushrooms do not belong to the conventional ones , in Syria and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . its food intoler@@ ance makes it an attractive food source for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the direct of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we decided to cultiv@@ ate the cultivation of mushrooms , because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reported Global Vo@@ ices that has been fought for three years to make this project known and op@@ ted his relief that it is now more and more &quot; to famili@@ arity . &quot;
&quot; to collect money for the initiative , be put in consultation with the NGO Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da &apos;s humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to convey 125 families knowledge for the pl@@ anting of fung@@ i , so Dr. Lei@@ la to Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached more than 100 % of their expected aim of approximately 12.@@ 700 € , but until Monday , the 04 . September 2017 , continued donations to Can@@ Do . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is dependent on generators , which will keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and the humidity at 80 % . &quot;
&quot; because of the fuel volume , locally made fuel from plastic , used to supply the generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices , that they began with the &quot; production &quot; from the regions base &quot; , &quot; before they checked out their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
&quot; afterwards , they planted a small mush@@ room in a tub . as this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on . &quot;
now they have designed a &quot; cur@@ riculum for the region . &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after further 3 months they found mushrooms throughout the east of Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge .
Dr. Lei@@ la declared that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; we want to bring people the mush@@ room breeding for various reasons &quot; : break of si@@ ege .

several hundred people prot@@ esting on October 21st in many districts of Portugal and called for the victims of fires that were in the north of Portugal in the north of Portugal .
two @-@ two persons died and approximately 70 were wo@@ unded as a result of wild@@ fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to that the government was called last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .

&quot; it is estimated that there were more than 500 fires in the northern and centrally located regions of the country , and around 250 million acres of forest and numerous villages . &quot;
&quot; in June it happened in Pedr@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande a similar tragedy , where it gave more deaths of 64 deaths and more than 200 Ver@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; according to the European fore@@ stry system that monitors the forest areas via satellite recordings , alone in Portugal approximately 500@@ .000 hectares of forest burned - an area of the size of the district Lisbon . &quot;

the fores@@ ee@@ able tragedy
the aim of the protests of Saturday was the call for better rewards and fire fighting measures by the state .
people asked why civil protection was not able to include the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
João So@@ ver@@ al of the Bund der Landwirte of Portugal declared the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
&quot; after Pedr@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , streets and villages were evac@@ u@@ ated for everything and nothing . &quot;
&quot; this Sunday they did this nowhere , there are frag@@ mentary reports of open streets that were surrounded by fire . &quot;
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria have had a similar tragedy like in June , since the streets were very late locked . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , construction ances in locations with high fire risk will be ques@@ tioned . &quot;
&quot; a broad proposal for the whale form , which had brought the government after heavy fires in 2003 and 2005 , was requested by the municipalities which saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment . &quot;
&quot; the government led a lo@@ adability of the law , which if the applic@@ ant had to be permitted through means of self @-@ protection - that was an open mind , so that everything could be built , the sor@@ val leads in the same article of the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organisation Quer@@ cus made attention to that large areas with Eu@@ cal@@ yp@@ tus , trees made from slightly burning wood , itself , like in a Teu@@ fel@@ lows , to fires of this type continues . &quot;
&quot; these issues are added to these issues that the website of Civil Protection from Portugal on 15 and 16 October , as inhabitants sought or tried to contact , offline . &quot;
&quot; it was a private initiative that gave the population with information supplies : it used the own civi@@ liz@@ ations using the application fo@@ gos@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires . &quot;
&quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developer João P@@ ina , to simplify the work of fire@@ bri@@ g@@ ade and was attended by this fat@@ eful weekend in October , that the bo@@ oth@@ s persec@@ uted , did not with@@ held the website more than half a million re@@ efs . &quot;

&quot; at one night in autumn 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began through the Taliban . &quot;
&quot; two years ago was a fear@@ less civil war between the various Mu@@ jah@@ ed@@ in group@@ ings , who had conquered the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus Afghanistan has become a land of terror and desp@@ air . &quot;
&quot; exactly at this time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central @-@ gh@@ istan , for the last time with his family at dinner . &quot;
&quot; even if his mother did not so , she didn &apos;t know that she could no longer see her son for a long time - maybe even more . &quot;
in the morning the boy should break up .
his un@@ cle would pick him up and bring him to the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the captain of the army of Haz@@ ara domin@@ ate the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat was just mur@@ dered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara felt suddenly .
the Taliban known for their hat@@ red on the Haz@@ ara @-@ known Taliban is always closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
&quot; a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ k found himself again in Pakistan . &quot;
he worked for a few years in a coher@@ ent . the work was heavy and made him sick .
&quot; then he took that which was of his low wages , and went in Iran . once again he was in a foreign country together with other refugees , and tow@@ ed sacks with mur@@ derer , who were harder than he himself to make his living . &quot;
&quot; at that time , life af@@ gh@@ anic refugees in Iran was characterised by mis@@ ery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really tough , rec@@ alled A@@ shar@@ k in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ ans refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site , on which we worked . &quot;
there were no services there and no heating . we pra@@ ised n@@ ylon in front of the open window so that we were not aw@@ ful at night .
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ k left his life without papers in Iran and made ready for travel to Europe . &quot;
&quot; during the dangerous passage on the sea , he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ and@@ ed on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek government had rejected its asylum , A@@ shar@@ k came to Italy . &quot;
&quot; some time was homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed twice a day food in need@@ y . &quot;
&quot; it is true that Italy due to relatively high level quot@@ as is a sort of second chance for rejected asylum seek@@ ers . it is true , however , that the conditions of finding the asylum seek@@ ers in the country , dis@@ astro@@ us are . &quot;
&quot; the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system is suffering from a general lack of transparency . &quot;
&quot; the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers will be accommo@@ dated in the more than 3000 &quot; special event centers , &quot; this is impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
&quot; according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be assigned to an account centre when it officially put an application on Asyl@@ um - which can still take a month after registration of the asylum seek@@ er . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who have no money for accommodation , either to rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street . &quot;
so it also erg@@ ing .
&quot; but his un@@ employed spirits was helped to liber@@ ate , soon from these conditions . &quot;
&quot; after spending several years of working in the construction sector , A@@ shar@@ f had made his entire investigation into the establishment of a hostel in Venice . &quot;
this was so good that he opened after a while still a second hostel and a bar@@ gain .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now theme of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - an Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the Tr@@ urs A@@ min Wah@@ i@@ di . &quot;
the film won the Venice City Award in 2017 which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

&quot; the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult . &quot;
&quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to in@@ official estimates , some 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
for many of them the country is a transi@@ tional solution on the way to other European countries .
&quot; in recent years some of the Afgh@@ ans have emerged , including tail@@ oring , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even pra@@ ised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice Ham@@ ed Ah@@ m@@ adi had the idea to his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iter and the kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the restaurant &apos;s menu is told by the different Afgh@@ an , Ira@@ qi , Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their trip to Italy . &quot;
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan opened Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari in Padua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ ul@@ og@@ na in Bologna and a Sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
&quot; however , A@@ shar@@ ia &apos;s goals are far beyond the Italian Gastronom@@ y and retail , and aim to leave back to the country , which he had to leave as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where a risk is , are also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ k with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
&quot; I never forget my country and I can not live happy whenever I know that my people suffer . &quot;
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as anyone else .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af for@@ ged also for@@ ged plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can buy packaging and preser@@ v@@ atives . &quot; &quot; thus they can sell their seri@@ ousness on the market and improve their financial situation . &quot;
&quot; the development to successful entrepreneurs was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end stand stability and prosperity . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af has made this trip itself . now , he would also like to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path . &quot;

&quot; the Egyptian Parliament has checked a legislative decre@@ e which sees that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook just after registration at a government authority . &quot;
users have to be able to use social networks within six months after successful legislation on the website of the authority under specification of their full name as well as their output number .
those who failed to reconc@@ ile this step up to six months of sentence or the removal of a penalty .
&quot; the law , which was applied by six@@ ty parliamentary members , is currently standing by legislative and constitutional Committee of the Parliament and shall be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; May , another member of the Board of Parliament adopted a stat@@ ute , in the tough@@ er stra@@ igh@@ s for the ins@@ ult of the president or a high officials . &quot;
&quot; under Egyptian law , the ins@@ ult@@ ation of the President as well as government institutions already pun@@ ish@@ able under the law , such an effect would act with pris@@ oned and cash pen@@ alties , as well as legal experts of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; if the law should be adopted , this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the susp@@ ending . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , this would under@@ estimated a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and assembly has already been in danger for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ id ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) announced when he taught violence against demonstr@@ ators , who demonstrated against the military put@@ sch against the elected president of Moh@@ ammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan wa@@ ited for as more than 700 prot@@ esters , who had been arrested at the same time , four years in prison on a Angel Award . &quot;
&quot; recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed on 20 May , because the prison @-@ line according to human rights groups took part in the acc@@ used to bring the def@@ endants from prison in the court . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agreed , head@@ load from among other weapon @-@ owned , illeg@@ ally assembly , murder and tried out murder . &quot;
&quot; in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iza spoke the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Barb@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their coverage to pro @-@ Mor@@ si seats on the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ Ada@@ wi@@ ya place in Cairo . &quot;
&quot; the Court reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalists Ab@@ dul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mu@@ st@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in previously mentioned cases , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
