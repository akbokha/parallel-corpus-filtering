<seg id="1">"although I visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year, I would now live there for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is tremendous.</seg>
<seg id="4">"as many of my generation I grew up with American films, American authors have read American authors and operated their sport."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had such profound impact on me that I was mainly a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as 14-year old I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, who covered with the help of Julia Roberts as Jura-coed the murderian conspiracy of an oil magnates who were interested in the Supreme Court with judges who were interested."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free after method Man," I was' s, as if that is the absolute truth, forget everything else, this is what I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year that I lived in Arizona, had only reinforced my admiration for the United States."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said," America is the only country where I have ever lived, whose diversity is so welcoming that you are always the one that you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very dirty love of thinking about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much was written about xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most amazing aspect of his ascension is for me as he goes with his bottdies.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops behind the mountain as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks, like a former colleague, and explains publicly his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, AfroAmerica and Women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people have responded to his statements and voted in Shar for him."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million votes received, he won at the Republican pre-elections, was the highest number one by the party nominated ever."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">"who are the Americans who support this bigrot person, I asked me?"</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not bring Trump and his voters with people in harmony which I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">"as for example my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, Director of journalism, people from all over the world takes up a deep breath-based human being, with whom I was talking about Islam and his past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"the Trumps's cosmos does not coincide with the author of Peter Bhatia, the present editor of the Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Bhatia and I had arrived at our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the" Phoenix Suns "at the game."</seg>
<seg id="25">"intolerance is also in contrast to generosity that I lived by Sandy Bahr, who fought her life for the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like their son."</seg>
<seg id="26">"it fits her to the commitment of Kristi Kappes, which always helped me with a lot of patience and grace, and my colleagues helped us to get used to the complexity of American life."</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, their wise Council helped me a lot with my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those by them embodied values of my love of America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump's path to the nominated republics presidential data, they offered me a hold and the counterpart of his limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, it turned out, however, that they were the exception of the rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on 8 November 2016, more than 50 million Americans, most of course, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of its contempt against non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the confrontation with the idea that people for Trump have agreed, because they were either divided into racism and fanaticism or because they were ready to overlook these things, I broke almost the heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to describe the Trump-voters as a rassists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"to arrange the people, one of my friends, is exactly what we have led to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">"this is superficial and respectful and indicates a inability to understand those, which act in a different way and think."</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not considered.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters, most of which are white, for Trump, because they want to re-win control over a country which she has disappointed?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they might want to say that they are still important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick who comment the cruel decision to raise a man who look down with contempt upon those who look different from it."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" whitelash "(anal.).: as much as" "elongation of the White against all other Ethniches"; wording of white in foreplay on the whites and whiplash, which means as much does the big Van Jones named, has exactly what America has done so great. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"million people around the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - what faith or background you may have always like, America is always welcome."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this land, elected as its president, twice the son of a Kenyl, whose story, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible."</seg>
<seg id="44">"but the choice Donald Trumps is a huge part of the white Americas, and says: to hell with diversity, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is back on the ruin.</seg>
<seg id="46">"in all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier, who has fallen in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">On a demonstration for Hillary Clinton had a change of change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would have my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" "Mr. Khan asked."</seg>

<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" braces the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" "answered them."</seg>
<seg id="54">Have Afro Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they were and their voices were loud. "</seg>
<seg id="56">"if someone who is not like you, a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and loud "NEIN"!</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan closed with the words:" "God is thanks, Mr. Trump, is that not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected. "</seg>
<seg id="59">"the land, for which his son was, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"this is now Trumps Land, told the message."</seg>

<seg id="96">These Eastern African countries show how technology and teamwork can be successful on illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that fought the wild fishing fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">"this article, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, published in a magazine that targeted solutions for environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-publication happens in the context of an agreement with Global Voices for sharing content.</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa was then known that this ship had already operated in liberal waters illegal fishing, before it was raised the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">"the East African countries were therefore brought about accordingly, and little genial to welcome a legislative breaker of this kind of its coasts."</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilised themselves rapidly against the ship. they refuted him to share one of their ports and gave himself to give him a fishing fixion."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" Ursuddenly, the prime minister was surrounded by countries that you simply refused all "," reminds of Benedict Kiilu, a leader of the Kenyan fisheries authority. he is part of a team that discovered the ship's time and followed. "</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013 the ship was driven out of the waters of the region: it was not able to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">"finally, it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars in Liberia, due to the lack of fish stocks."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, the criminal practices crossed and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal Fisheries)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"the members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar the six countries, which at that time the prime minister had driven out of their waters."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" so we have eight countries, which are like-minded and work together. they exchange information and stand out each other where it comes to illegal fishing, "says Tony Long, leader of the Pew Charitable Trusts project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is by definition unregulated: what is caught by it is hidden that because it is extremely difficult to start-up. thus the illegal fishing is a major part of the surviving of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">"due to the intentional disregard of existing laws, through which certain habitats and species are to be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystems, can cause a delicate balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but while actions against illegal fishing once were hindered by bureaucratic hurdles and also through the snail empirical, with the information between individual countries, so these actions occur in real time, with trackable at FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"there, the individual countries can share existing licenses for example, news about suspects news or details that have noticed or experienced during a port speculation."</seg>
<seg id="113">"Fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive when it move around the open sea, using satellite data."</seg>
<seg id="114">"this makes it possible to identify the authorities to record ships that fish in vain areas. also, let's discover so suspected driving routes - about such that a ship invites its fish on the road to other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"the idea could show such investigations whether the participating ships have a fishing license, where they were on the road, and possibly also whether they have a criminal register."</seg>
<seg id="116">"countries that are against illegal fishing, can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports. what means that ships will not sell their charges. and that they can even be forced to numbers of penalties, as in the case of the Prime Minister."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "there is a significant financial loss for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="118">"and that's what we want to achieve," says Per Erik Bergh, leading director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consultant company that advocates the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i. "</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed Front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the already mentioned platform was created to gain valued 20 million USD to lost sales, which will lose the eight members of the network HISH-i every year because of illegal fishermen who penetrate in East African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">East-Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishings that attracts the region of commercial fishing from around the world. among these also those illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">"these practices, among other promotions, like the sailing under falter flag, fake royalties, indication of fantasiename, the fish-protected species and the fish in nature conservation."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they specifically use the lack of international co-operation and make the weaknesses of a non-complete control system", "says Long." "earlier a ship could not have been illegal and a country could not say 'you darling my port'."</seg>
<seg id="124">"but another country could say 'Komm to me'." "and precisely this legal Schlupfloch is trying to close the FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its foundation FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 investigations of comparative ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">"it has criminal networks revealed to spread the counterfake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that are used several fraudulent identities, and it has been persecuted ships and found."</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its collaboration with Interpol, the international authority to combat crime, FISH-i is able to share information on illegal fishing across large distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime, "" says Bergh. "</seg>
<seg id="130">"he builds a system that should help the FISH-i, suspects ships precise."</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo with friendly permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"Fish-i's satellite system, which is always further developed, also helps to hide the illegal ships who like to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position. and that we try to cross-cross," says Duncan Copeland, Chefanalyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, a NRO which also deals with fisheries data and FISH-i technical support. "</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships turn off for instance their automatic identification systems that they cannot be grounded more of satellite.</seg>
<seg id="135">"Copeland helps to build a system that connects various information levels together. it is supposed to help FISH-i to find criminal ships with greater precision."</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team African nations actually influence influence on the undoubtedly global issue of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth recently opened the Platform Global Fishing Watch: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide with the position of each tractable ship worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "together with the neighbors to get a better picture of what is doing - this is simply sense," "he says." "here is a chance for countries to unite and bundle their resources for the study."</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this on a global level." "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project to run, where a global system allows the tracking of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">"there are signs that FISH-i's activities not only feel crime, but they also shout."</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships used to count earlier without a license and hardly to be reckoned with consequences that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in the FISH-i participated in the meantime a 33% increase in the fishing gear, since then fishing boats have more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia had put, Greko 1 stopped, found the inspectors there on board seppe whose use is prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo with friendly permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries also notice these successes." "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "says Kiilu." "in West Africa a year will disappear several hundreds of millions of dollars through illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"in 2015 six countries joined together, to the so called West Africa Task Force. they now fight against illegal fishing, based on exactly the same model such as FISH-i." "With safety the goal, even more such initiatives and structures also arise in other regions," "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently, FISH-i's youngest member of Somalia could report its first great triumph: in October it was Greko 1, a ship which was under falscher's flag. and not only was the ship used without license and were banned by now."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also penetrated to ban waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with the taking of measures against Greko 1 put a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i, this is a further success of many. and at the same time the proof that such a special, collaborative work is actually working in the whole world sea. Emma Bryce is freelance journalist and lives in London. there she writes on the topic of environment, technology and nutrition."</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">"to get back, you need two important skills: passive voice knowledge to understand the source text and to transmit active language knowledge to transmit it into the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">"the latter requires the active mastery of the target language - something that in the case of the case. in general, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - motherlanguage."</seg>
<seg id="379">"thus, a French native language should translate into French an example from English into French - not from French into English."</seg>

<seg id="381">"many Japanese firms do not employ workers with English as our native language, translations into English. this may be due to error message for overlay, cost reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers that learn japanese."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies, who don't have any foreign employees, let translations still have finished. then the Japanese staff, whose English knowledge is done to be the best, no matter how good or bad his language knowledge really are."</seg>

<seg id="384">Machine translation are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The worrens and mysterious sentences created by mechanical translations created that this technique cannot replace too long for any human translator. this applies to some languages very special.</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the rarity of English formulations in Japan, including the mysterious atriprints, which often decorate T-shirts or bags, are used only for stylistic reasons - not read or understood to be understood."</seg>

<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian parliamentsia have recently agreed to put law on the rule of law on the use of usage and utility of social networks.</seg>
<seg id="503">"when he is accepted by the Parliament, the makers and users must register social media in Egypt with a government authority in order to use social media including Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="504">"on the basis of the law, then a place would be set up, which is charged with citizens to share social media."</seg>
<seg id="505">"within six months of acceptance of the law, those who would have to register and register users on the site of the site with their right names and staff members in order to use social networks."</seg>
<seg id="506">"will it be reconciled this, so this could bring a penalty up to six months of custody or an ATM."</seg>
<seg id="507">"the legislature, which consists of six paragrpenalties and in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as" any use, which runs through the Internet and used to communicate with others by means of voice, video clip and text. "</seg>
<seg id="508">"it is unclear as the law is going through, since the draft is no indication of how Egyptian authorities should not register any of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure regulation on the level of social media companies."</seg>
<seg id="509">"Riyad Abdul Sattar, parliament of Parliament and Patrons of the Legislative Office, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users and users receive a user name and password" to get through the firewall, the Facebook blocked. "</seg>
<seg id="510">"this could mean that Egypt is planning to educate a firewall on a national level around Facebook. due to which it would be necessary for Egypt, information about their identity to access the network."</seg>
<seg id="511">But it is not yet known that such plans are to exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Expert and expert on site are sceptical concerning the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">"Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist (in German" leading research "") of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German "Egypt Initiative for personal rights"), "said Global Voices:"</seg>
<seg id="514">I'm strongly encouraged to the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">"in my opinion, it is so important that just as they can control the physical public and private spaces, it could also be done online."</seg>
<seg id="516">"if I take it seriously, then that they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who apply a permit or not. and this means a twisted system to monitor the activities of the people and also to bring them to a judicial process."</seg>
<seg id="517">This is by no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">"to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed at the legislative Parliament and the Constitutional committees before it goes into the plenary session."</seg>
<seg id="519">"whether its acceptance and enforcement will succeed, or not, the draft is maximised in line with a pro-military thinking in parliament, in whose sense the control is maximised and ensured that no deviating Narration on the surface is present," says Raoof. "</seg>

<seg id="694">The original workshops were guided by the educator David Hodges who lives in Montreal and in North-Quebec with ten Cree communities and then worked with the Cree Hip-hop-Group The Northstars.</seg>
<seg id="695">"the workshop is thus increasing that young participants in talks like" cultural identity, language, confrontation, love, self-unacceptable "or what they are always found in mind."</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos where young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">"because the workshops were so popular, the team worked with other First Nations Communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in the U.S. state Nebraska."</seg>
<seg id="698">"this video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'yoo tells in the area of the tribe of the Kitchencally First nation in British Columbia, for example, the history of the Highway 16, also called" Highway of tears, "in which almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered."</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="700">"the next video of the Nemaska Cree First nation uses the motif of a video player to convey how important to preserve traditional customs and customs, despite the influences of globalization."</seg>
<seg id="701">"many of the songs were published in Indigenous languages, although the young people of the First Nations are not always bounded."</seg>
<seg id="702">"in the following song, that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation have taken, the refrain is sung on Cree."</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved were given some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars Hip-hop group who gave them a strophe in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">"on the Facebookpage of N'we Jinan, the Strophe is available in transcript, as well as a translation into English, which is translated here into German."</seg>

<seg id="751">"on the day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looking at the trauma or to the municipalities that have learned to live with pain."</seg>
<seg id="752">"here are behind every body, behind any bone funds in the hundreds of married tombs, the stories of zahlloser parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners who might never heal their wounds."</seg>
<seg id="753">"therefore, the Mexican news portal Animal PolÃ­tico has launched the digital project" "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "with drug trading"). "</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal PolÃ­tico describes the project so:</seg>

<seg id="772">Where should we get it? "</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a vivir con el narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">"we must not only show the faces of those who are of fear. we need to show the international community the conflicts, the disruption and government management."</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">"KYHB, a lesbian by Animal PolÃ­tico, wrote this post from taxco, in the federal state of Guerrero in central mexiko."</seg>

<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the one who is wiped or sad. it works as a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to the body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be outwined or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">You write on:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it is not normal that my 10-year old Cousin thinks that he is foco (German: drug dealers) will be, when he is great. and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the" "heroine" "of criminal case when they go through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me, this is as if they hear ones who have lost someone and those who have fear that they have happened so something."</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories to mere numbers are in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"the inelessness of men is incredible for me, when the death of six people and the disappearances of 43 students were justified in a neighbor that they were wounded."</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to speak that they are spared by such tragedies if they are not stirring and silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">"Maribel L. from Mexico-town wrote the post" Four months of extortion in the main town of capital: like a family of drugations below, until they were destroyed at the end of not only the business, but also their families apart. "</seg>

<seg id="799">The journalist Mario GutiÃ©rrez Vega published the article "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez: one of violence led by violence."</seg>

<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are unimportant compared to the pain in his eyes - speaking for a boy for the whole life of violence and learning to learn to live.</seg>
<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, one told him that his mother disappeared."</seg>
<seg id="807">But that was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">"his childhood has been past two years ago, when he was just a few blocks away from his home, the bloody corpse of his Father had been shot by armed men from a passing by car."</seg>
<seg id="809">"when Bryan was born, the situation in JuÃ¡rez looked like this:"</seg>

<seg id="812">In 2010 alone the State of the Prosecutor 3103 Morde. this corresponds to the cut 8.5 Morden per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave organised crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories still live in view of new headlines. this project reminds us of those that we should not forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">"in addition to the project" Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco "launched the data journalism project Narcodata in life, whose objective is to show the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trading, who has tormented the country in the last four decades, in a comprehensible manner."</seg>

<seg id="1187">"the book, published last year and here license is available, contains a number of attempts that deal with the free culture in the face of repression."</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is said:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book aims to discuss how movements are built for free knowledge and what the real costs are connected with which this is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">"activists, artist, designers, developers, researchers, researchers, developers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge, have worked on page to check over the fog, which surrounds our newsletters, and to create something different from our different experiences."</seg>

<seg id="1193">His name was repainted from the directory of the Adra prison in which he sat on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then we have no information about its current state or place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">"the introductory part of his book with the title Collective Memory gives his friends and family, who want to push for his release and want to know him back in his normal life and freedom."</seg>
<seg id="1196">"to see how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us have to begin to think about their own destinies, actions and decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we decide?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up extreme beliefs in this process?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The Webdeveloper for Open Source and digital activities has been in the imprisonment of Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">"in October 2015 Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military institution to be transferred to an unknown location."</seg>
<seg id="1202">"his wife, the writer and Ombudsperson Noura Ghazi, reported that the" military police bass is based on a "strictly secret" "command of the military court from his cell into Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">"Ghazi reported that they had been contacted by people on 12 November 2015, who created himself as an insider-Assad's government and put them in knowledge from an invigorous death part against her husband."</seg>
<seg id="1204">His place of place and state remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">"a leader of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role to expand access to the internet and knowledge of the public in Syria."</seg>
<seg id="1206">"Barry Threw, a designer, Technologist and currently over the head of New Palmyra, a project which founded Bassel, writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book:"</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Basque cultural prototypes are prescient as the work that he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">"Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites of the world, was the cross-kreuz of numerous civilizations and here, Greek-roman architectural species with hiesigen traditions and Persian influences."</seg>
<seg id="1209">"at that time, Bassel could not know that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would put it all that architecture that embodied not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but of the world."</seg>
<seg id="1210">"this strip is created in the digital archaeology and preservation has created a contemporary music, which will be invaluable for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future."</seg>
<seg id="1211">"typically, Bassel could not yet complete this project yet."</seg>
<seg id="1212">"Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband, to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:"</seg>
<seg id="1213">"I have spent my whole life with this, from freedom to dream and bass taught me to embrace her."</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">"Bassel brought me English, even when he was already in custody."</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read English well and speak.</seg>
<seg id="1217">"he always has his knowledge shared with each one who has asked. he has taught others, English to read and speak English."</seg>
<seg id="1218">"Bassel gave me the gate to the technology. he taught me, both computer and smartphones."</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">"he has brought the other wearrests on how they use computers, at least theoretically, without that they actually kept one in their hands."</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Warten) who wrote in 2012 until 2015 to her husband than he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together on the book a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">They tasted the lyrics to him when she visited him and he overlaid it from the Arabian into English.</seg>

<seg id="1289">"according to information from Facebook-users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took its Posts from the net, because it enthouses the word 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although the origin of the word is still being discussed, it is usually used to refer to people ostIndian origin, or generally used as adjectives."</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook zensively the word" "Kalar" "or is it done today (in Burmesan Scriptures) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of the Hassan in Burma in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">"over the past few years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely valuable connotation."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word that is mostly used by Ultra-nationalists as Hassle against Muslims, which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in the effort to fight Hassan language in Myanmar, the company has a lot of meaningful content on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"Kalar 'may usually be associated with racism, but the word itself is not automatically called Hassan."</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also Posts, where they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts as to their use."</seg>
<seg id="1297">"in addition, there are several burmesan words with various meanings that have the same letter as' Kalar '."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, chair will be written in Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters, as well as other words like 'Kalar PAE' (Spage) or 'Calar oat' (curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebookuser Aung Kaung Myat explained the various meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A mail of one of my friends was now deleted because he contained the word of Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">"however, he had asked his friends on a spiritual way whether she kissing his back pain, having made a word play."</seg>
<seg id="1302">"the set ku la -" "healing" "(ku) + the keyword (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different."</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"Zin Win Haped is the opinion that they hate a language of radial nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook analyses, before it all Posts LÃ¶sche, who circulate in suspected racism."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It automatically filtered the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automation is not understood what you write on Facbeook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">"what it should do instead, is the post carefully to analyse and control it by checking the words."</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar PAE" (Spalternate).</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good is that these three-story nationalists, spread the Hassan, a fairly good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcision their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action may send a strong signal to everyone who disseminate the Hassan, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experience of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proved that the censorship of keywords often create a katz- and mouse game, whereby the users can easily begin using social networks to express a new word or an alternative spelling of the censored Word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">"the author Aung Kaung Myat described, how Facebook started to delete his poise, when he only wanted to communicate his friends that the word" Kalar "is banned from the social network:"</seg>
<seg id="1315">"when I was attentive to this new directive by Facebook, I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the Word is closed."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was banned the Liken, post and parts of content for 24 hours because the post" Facebook community standards have not been met. "</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a variety of poies of people who have no negative intentions or just try to show their opinions against the Hassan nationalist nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his mail was removed who has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"in the post, the author told his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad."</seg>
<seg id="1321">"Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should do more at the beginning of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community ask for advice:"</seg>
<seg id="1322">"Facebook likes a benevolent intent to reduce racism in Burma by their platform, but it does not work."</seg>
<seg id="1323">Such words to censored will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"in addition, it seems as if they have started with no local context or technical support and have just banned words like" chair "or" inheritance curry. "</seg>
<seg id="1325">"even as they have found that they have made mistakes, they were not tried to resofold the falsified posts."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits, which would give them a great turnover, it would be great."</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic igensur has taken care of a lot of sprisoon among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">"instead of taking it seriously, users now turn on Facebook and consciously writing the word 'Kalar' not in the context of Hassan, to see whether their posts are taken from the grid."</seg>

<seg id="1534">"some, including me, make it still, but only when they are alone and no other family members are there."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of her husband; only one or two women are now wearing Zinnoberred on their forehead.</seg>

<seg id="1963">"in the communication, the app is said to gain access to terrorist information."</seg>
<seg id="1964">"yet, the authorities use the app to use the app for more than the fight against terrorism."</seg>

<seg id="1970">This App with the filters for minors should help children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>

<seg id="1972">"for example, the" "remote" "control" "actors or even hackers fails to manipulate the home network of a person or steal it."</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in harmony with other measures to take control of digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">"while reports about digital censorship in China often focus on the experience of users in larger cities in the east and south, the reality is very often dÃ¼sterer for those who live in remote, predictated ethnic minority regions like Xinjiang and Tibet."</seg>
<seg id="1975">To limit unrest and dissatisfaction in the conflict-areas, the authorities often arrange extreme conditions and monitoring measures as well as routinant internet shutdowns. "</seg>

<seg id="1979">If you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software they could be detained up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a return for technological development.</seg>

<seg id="1985">After the installation of Jingwang your computer and mobile phones are available in Xinjiang for electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">"the provisions in Jingwang may possibly be a reaction to the instructions of the city council, to minimize the dissemination of illegal contents."</seg>

<seg id="2077">"my semi-shot body, which was stretched out on the ground was the perfect power conductor."</seg>

<seg id="2079">After two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">This must be so at midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">"I decided to lay down again again; say we say, that was my only option."</seg>
<seg id="2082">"a few hours left, which came to me as minutes."</seg>

<seg id="2090">"the jordanic Rapper Emsallam Hdaib redet the rights of LGBTQ + Community, freedom of expression and resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smoked a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"the photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"Emsallam Hdaib spends the most of his time inside; from time to his canvas, time to his computer, and again to his couch."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"but what you can rely on, is a cigarette between his fingers or with nicott lips to discover."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"he lives in the prime minister of his family house which had been united to them since 1967; in which Israel was completed his occupation of the West Bank, and Hdaibs family had been forced to flee out of their village in Palestine in which she had lived as felahyeen (about: Farmer)."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"for now six years, Hdaib has been a passionate majority, the conservative majority faces gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapid music."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"with his music, which often focuses on issues like Orientalism, racism and situation in Palestinian refugees. all these issues are not only seen in his hometown of Amman Relevance, but also in cities that reach from Damascus in Syria to Sanaa in Yemen."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"with his 25 years Hdaib sees himself as a person who is not restricted in his mind through borders, and he may suffer his own statement by the people who suffer the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not open it to the US American foreign policy a special disposition.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded from the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib does not believe his compassion for those who try to do in war areas, anything with his identity as" Palestinian "fleed the second generation", "even if he was born in Jordan, and has never been in Palestine yet."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I do not think because of my own living conditions," stresses Hdaib. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" I think "" I am because I am a man "" while in water soldered as cafÃ© in two cups; it is the holy month of Ramadan. in this time it is planned for Muslims, from sunrise to sunset. "</seg>
<seg id="2105">The jordanic law also discusses that the public consumption of food is illegal during the Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; and on the other hand a cup of coffee on a sensing hot junior day has little to do with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">"basically, the smoulder warm coffee and the tail of the Kent cigarette in the nose is primarily associated with freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky, especially when one gets a look into the neighbouring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"from hence, it is easy to do basic things - just like to drink the public during the Ramadan of water - to do not land prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, the State Department has told the appearance of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some Parliamentary Assembly, which support the Islamic Action Front - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontage of Hamed Sinno, contradicts the cultural and traditional standards of the country and be contradictory the main reason for the concert."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"the MP and former press preacher in the Islamic Coalition DIMA Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert" "was cancelled" "because of the sexual orientation of the singer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arabic spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is more dangerous activism which represents the old-proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement of Mashrou'Leila the jordanic people as" "progressive supporter of human rights", "which continues to work for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement is likely to be simply not simply confession rhetoric, but actually an increasingly clear clearing reality in Jordan, which occurs in Hdaib's work clearly."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016, Hdaib traditional sex towers, by having his vision of the fate of Arabian women, the vorehelichen sex have."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the picture shows the skeleton of a apparently burnt-known woman, their arms and legs to stretch up to the corners of the canvas."</seg>
<seg id="2118">"it is surrounded by a red lake, perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those they should really trust."</seg>
<seg id="2119">"in Jordan, the number of 'honorary murder' has increased in Jordan, the inofficial outside."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"human Rights Watch that reached its peak in 2016, however, that Jordan reached its peak; however, its institutional infrastructure is missing to support the women, the victims tried Morning or domestic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law to breakdowns from the year 1954, women who are exposed to the risk of invigorous violence, and for its release is often a years of bureaucratic effort and the guarantee of the family is necessary that the woman is nothing to happen."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is well known for it, even not redeemed from subjects that in his country long as tabu gold."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib argued that his work is politically, however, that he's his music, the full exponites of sexuality, freedom and expression is not separate from politics."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"mir was buried in politics," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed" Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity in attack.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"in" Lawla al 3aib "" and in "" Ghareeb "" is the focus on poverty. "</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the list of the songs, which are in the core politically, can be continued."</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib released a song named "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated many times:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a form of market in which one can get, in his words," what you want, "- be faith or non-faith, haretero- or homosexuality."</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noticed that hardly any one speaks in Jordan about the rights of gay and lesbian and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + -individuals were still severed greatly in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014 Hdaib introduced a interview for the popular Rabordanian OnlineProgram Roya, in order to remember that his comments were torn out of the context, revolves and his opinion were censored."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but it was only a processed version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today Hdaib acquires Hdaib open to the Arabian LGBT TQ + Community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homosexuals do not walk in Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentioned Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, who is still alive today thanks to his homoerotic poems in memory."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks yourself: if Abu Nudity could work once again on behalf of the calibre, in the eighth century I was openly able to write homosexuality, why not?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the Haschemitic kingdom there is nothing new more that the government attacks on freedom of expression, and that progressive voices are brought to silence."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the jordanic message service took several former government departments and members of the teaching network, with reasoning, they would have expressed themselves on comments in social media to face problems that are rooted with deep in the country-rooted corruption."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of this, the concert of Hdaibs believe only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to make a structural conversion in the next generation of Jordan."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him progress is a constant eye and taking. Jordan has now wounded for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - so it looks a slow, thought and innumerable changes. he is sure that these changes will take place from day to day in the heart of the jordanian society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"ultimately, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, also, from an Arab world without interventions from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he did not only bring his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to experience them."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region is using music, art and literature of real and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, stretching, and an artificial type of particular democracies. at least he hopes that."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until there is so far, Hdaib will continue to resist and therefore also resist resistance."</seg>

<seg id="2150">These large, extravagant warribs are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Nebuta festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">"they assumed that there is a variant of Tanabata festival, which is usually widely celebrated in August in many areas of Tohosters. another theory was postponed that the drums and punching over more than a thousand years were passed, to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi, into the knees."</seg>

<seg id="2172">"the unprecedented demand for hairstyles that go on the extreme limits of imagination and creativity, even has an annual event inspired, the competition of the hairdresser" Batalla de Barberos ", which has been held since 2014."</seg>

<seg id="2181">"the following article is the edited version of the message" Lovemaker to Guerillakler, "which released the international online magazine Tea After Twelve."</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution will be published in the framework of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love cribness to people who we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not still much more important, people who have bagued out, affection?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">Exactly this question went out to the two young Colombian activists of Leonardo PÃ¡rraga by the Young-Youth Foundation and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth-Foundation no longer from the head and inspired it to the campaign Cartas por la reciliaciÃ³n (Letters to reconciliation) to write the young people to do Guerillakmpen letters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">"only in short years ago, her land became a historical event, and they wanted to help their part: after years, the Colombian government had concluded a peace agreement with the GuerillaMovement FARC (German: revolutionary armed forces in Latin America), which forms the closing of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"International was the submission of the peace treaty, as so important that the Colombian president Jose Manuel Santos was awarded for its services to the Nobel Peace Prize."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"however, in front of the Colombian, there is still a long way to speak of a real reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"guerrilla warrians who have lived for many years in illegal camps, had to be suspended and around the clock for their weapons, must now be integrated into the life as civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society in turn, which accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deeply hatred towards guerrilla warts, it must now take in their ranks and support them in building a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young columbians have to come together and help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that is exactly what they did: until now I have written thousands of young people's letters - love bots on former guerrands to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for each former Guerillac fighters - which should be personally handed over.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for the healing was born on the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Prize, who held in February 2017 in BogotÃ¡. there were Leonardo and Cristian the opportunity to speak briefly with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"we said that we love the people, who love, on Valentine's Day thousands of Loving, but those are forgotten that they need much unnecessary."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he plan, told he continued to share his love with people this year, most of the most urgent need."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"thus the plan to write letters of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, which now will find their place in society and will need to build a new life." "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse from a war history to a common history of peace."</seg>
<seg id="2199">"so far, within the framework of the campaign was collected more than 2000 letters."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia like Cali, Manitales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡."</seg>
<seg id="2201">I never thought that someone would forgive me</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters passed on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the region of Caldono-Cauca.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipal Authorities of Cali and Leonardo from the Stiftung BogotArt traveled to the camp to get the letters personally."</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC placed themselves on how they had done earlier in order to take the precepts of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they received no precepts, but letters of malnourishing of people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for everyone involved." it's incredible how many different feelings you can walk in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in-between, told the politicians of Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later. "</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra is an assistant of the Governing of the Province of Valle del Cauca for this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after we passed the letters, I conducted a former fighters in the camp of the Guerilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" Cambuches "(a kind of hut in which the Guerillakler live), I saw a guillator, who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I had fear to go down, because beside him on the bed it was a MGL-pomegress, a deadly weapon in the Dornreddish sheep."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"nevertheless I talked to him and asked:" "hello, what do they say right?" "he said," I replied to a letter I wrote me someone. "</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never in my life someone wrote something so nice, so I was looking forward to it."</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him firm and put me next to the granatlight.</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was sorry, was sorry to be all the years of faithful companion of this struggles, and wanted to help him write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he never expected anything else from life than war. join the FARC, was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers before hunger." "I would never thought that someone would forgive myself for my mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="2217">"but now I know that there is a society out there, who is waiting for us with open arms."</seg>
<seg id="2218">"until now, I just learned how to handle weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"for prelude, students and some leaders of the FARC came together to a discussion."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC already carried out in the concefold.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"therefore the leaders of the FARC the history of the organization, their ideals and gave an insight into their views on the peace process: for many years, we have experienced how the social unrighteousness from the state on all the Colombian people, we can help us to create the society in this country."</seg>
<seg id="2224">"for a goal of this size, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles," said one of them. "</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"to hear these people who have never heard before and had no choice, and to recognize that people who were often seen as monsters and even hate, even people with beautiful feelings were circumcised by their living conditions and their environment, was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"the reality, in which the country lives, does hurry me."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforted me that all men - even those who have killed and so much damage, we can bring something and give a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monsalve, the Archbishop of the City of Cali, the following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">Kolumbians was prophesied that after the disarming peace would reign.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as it is inequality, hunger and a lack of education, health care and employment opportunities there will always be people who are ready to attack weapons, and for their rights to protest. and this is totally justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we run by the FARC now at peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"therefore, we call all defenders of peace - regardless of which race, religion or ideology they belong to them - to rise above all that of a country in war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifice, because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those among us who defend life as the basis of existence, will imminate many difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"on our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2284">"they placed absurde demands: some told me, I must prove it by going up without the streets, others wanted that I was not changed at the official television in Grosny and say that I was not changed my gender, that everything was just bad, and Photoshop."</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what could I say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people were talking to my mother on the road.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"they said to her," You have brought a monster to the world that not only your family, but the whole republic has been ashamed. "</seg>
<seg id="2290">"we can not stirred you, because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here."</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and she lay a strick around the neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later stood under the window a car with broken window windows and a numbering plate with a 95 dron.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Once it happened for the third time I was clear that there was something lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My dear friends-ups of the numbering signs - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how are you escaped?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for security reasons I want to make their name inexpensive, but I want to say that I remember it all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with her help I left the country, but then something was something uncredible."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought it without register without notice, without notice, without anything."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I crush my old SIM card and cast it into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checkte into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"in the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message:" you think not about, you warmest in security, just because you leave the country? "</seg>
<seg id="2309">"our people already know, in what hotel you do. you even know your room number."</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove it: it is the number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was in fact my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: do you still get in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, we do not talk about the sex equation, this is a tabby issue."</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditional Caucasian elements I still have in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"as much as I wish, this seelic barrier can I not overcome."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I am saying that, as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chat with camera, I actually give me trouble to look like the person who reminds them out of their past - thus to my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what do your friends do, those who have stayed there?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I have submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For the required I need current information on the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">"I spoke with someone, the one-half months in Argun."</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that during the Ramadan there were no people arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he closed a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"with that, my I, they probably load the relatives, these take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end require a proof that the so-called" "honor" "experienced by blood satisfaction."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: will now also be held pregnant men in these secrecy?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says it was not very many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, then above all those who have no wealthy relatives, or those of their relatives were dropped to ask for Kadyrows Court."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they will be held there, so that you can present them later than terrorists."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say, they should be converted, one will show off their bodies on TV and claim them, they could have attacked your village or military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people were not simply disappeared, but specifically undersurfaced, to radiate himself."</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this now just a mutation or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just have someone who had one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">"he says that many people disappeared in this prison, after their beard had grown."</seg>
<seg id="2339">There have been nothing new from them.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply have taken them.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so called Lord, this person was himself involved, when these people were taken away."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"however, they were not presented as bandits, in addition there were no reports yet. we suspect that such actions are quite possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why would it not have allowed these people to shave yourself?</seg>
<seg id="2344">"know if these persecutions and abductions of people, who belong to a so called" nontraditional "orientation, already in the past?"</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I was my hair always long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I believe that in 2003 I was already known to Grosny as I lived there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">At Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999, when the sharia was considered, I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, at that time it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia originally wanted to rise to the" "civilizations", "finally, ultimately has returned to the Stoneage."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this under the sharia law possible?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were stained; I had colored eyelashes, carried tubejeans and short Tops. "</seg>
<seg id="2354">The security of the mystery of the Scharia has never put me only a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in front of the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people met me."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several benches were standing, and all the city knew; they knew why men, young people, there met."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never revived.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a speech: Kharda ma Kharda. that means: "Spare not about the hurt of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">"it is often said to children, if they are funny about sick."</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so simply have their eyes closed before you, because they believed, you are sick?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never revived me never hunted and never beaten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace time kept up?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: as long as Kadyrow stood on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed Minister for Prime Minister, he started to talk on TV on morality."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he did not speak about us by se, but mainly on the behaviour of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel how the people in the city began to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">"who previously worked and gele, I looked at once with Argie."</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came back home, I could feel how the situation in the Republic has been growing steadily."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity go you now by?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I won't get a lot - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the US not much.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"apart from that, I am still working as a activisas."</seg>
<seg id="2375">"currently, I am responsible for 15 Muslim women."</seg>
<seg id="2376">I join them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we organize teacups, meetings, I go back to the hospital and help them to get involved."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I do not accept cents for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people himself when I dismiss the hiding place.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and wants to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you have a Hiddeab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is almmed.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So the nature that has purely nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">"this is exactly the same as Chereezebox, who want to make you welded with foam before the mouth, that there are no oscillating coils."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the Dagestans have which, the Kabardiners have which, the Russians also have which; on the whole planet there is it - but not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I come from there, that's why it is unpleasant for me to hear."</seg>
<seg id="2387">I come here so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">"many of them - practicing Muslims, who go into the mosque and during the Ramadan, live together with men."</seg>
<seg id="2389">"know, many think about Transidentity men, men love, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a trustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different types of sensation, to be accurate, different ways of life."</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important to feel me in my own skin and not ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry that I will be so personal here but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not at all sad for it - I just know that I am now myself.</seg>

<seg id="2411">"the region, where most of the Arab Ahwazi community is based in the Arab Ahwazi community, has been shaken from a profound economic crisis which makes it tough to climb up to the native Arab population."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"in front of a century, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlavi-monarchy took over power and 1925 big efforts made to stop ethnic autonomy throughout Iran."</seg>

<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments under the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"when I say that I am not a feminist, react many women - especially white women who call themselves as intersectionals feminists - with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put a well-thought scientific and social arguments against me why I should be feminist and why we generally be all feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, women nowadays are still less money in spite of equal education than men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">"that women are still under strict observation, if it is about what they may do with their body."</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women have come before or later in various areas of life on a gÃ¤b blanket, and that discrimination based on sex still passes through the many different countries and faiths."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware of me and well-known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I will be double and triple below.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"and yet: if I have to speak on skin colour, on racism, on black roud, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I have been considering how we have always talked about segregation and discrimination, both in and outside the feminist movement, have been confiscated many white feminists and white interiors of feminists."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"but nevertheless all agree that women - all women should come together to uplift their votes and 'Kumbaya, my Lord" to sing "to reach the equality (some) of women."</seg>
<seg id="2449">"but they don't want to talk about that in addition to sexualised violence an institutionalized form of racial violence gives, that we are exposed to black women in two different ways."</seg>
<seg id="2450">"or above, black women and women of other ethnics, and of origin, less than white men and women."</seg>
<seg id="2451">"that black girls and girls with a migration background of the school are referred to as white girls, due to obvious integrations problems."</seg>
<seg id="2452">"or that women are exposed in black spheres, and women with a migration background of a higher risk to suffer domestic violence and violence in the partnership, than white women."</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand, I want all the women, all men and all humans have neither skin colour the same rights; but on the other hand I can not consider myself as black woman in their centre, which may refuse the white woman who refers both to the gender and the skin colour of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">"I am exhausted, and I will no longer fight for my membership in a white-feministic-oriented donkey, who always rejected me and innumerated other black women and over again."</seg>
<seg id="2455">"sojourner confiscated in 1851 in their speech:" "am I not a woman?" and also I refuse to maintain an ideology, in which the black woman in historical respects is a terrible and marginalized nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I refuse to join myself, groupings me groupings, which also absorb our customs and customs to advance its egocentric programme."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer try to specify white women the importance of overcutting of skin colour and gender. because some of them will continue to mention the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to belung a better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although the intersektionale feminism was founded to give women of different people a home and disborders from white feminism, is still the word" feminism "in his name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I prefer to fix me full of feminism and bringing me the motion of the Womanism, which was declared for my dark skin and my status as a woman, which is so stubbornly that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">"now it is more important than ever, that we define black women in our own ideas and set us into the spheres, which are created by us for us."</seg>

<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersektionale feminists immediately call for separatism and exclusion after they have read these lines, please inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected."</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanist environment I can ascend black women and women of other cultures because this paradigm exist.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the abridged and processed version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay. the article belongs to the series # PorserMujer (# soft women) which reported about violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed for the protection of the persons concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2482">"Arda BÃ¡ez said to Ada BÃ¡ez, that she had nothing against Luis Balbuena, its expartners who has become violent against violent."</seg>
<seg id="2483">"since the end of their relationship was a little time passed and the police said, their statement would be placed to the acts, but more could not do."</seg>
<seg id="2484">"as another woman of Balbuena, because of abuse, the acedingly display of Ada BÃ¡ez did nothing."</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later the second woman went back to the ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the devil-circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"if women are given at all notice, they generally receive no support from the state."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases, women also depend on the men that they misses. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence at all at all at the prosecution authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"contents and Statistics 2 Invisible Missions, and a legal system, which is not contract3 of Paraguay laws: good approach, defective implementation and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it's hard to determine how many women really will be misleading, says Myrian GonzÃ¡lez, researcher for genderenquiries at the Centro de DocumentaciÃ³n y Estudios, a sociologist research institution in Paraguay." "there are various statements and reports, which however do not even indicate the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2491">"however, the numbers available are however alarming."</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015 there were at the District Apostle 9600 indicators for domestic violence. at 70% of it it was about violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 ads because of domestic violence among peace matters. also here stood 86% of the ads of women.</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the ads, 40% of women were said that they were physically misled, 55% of the women were spoken of psychic failure."</seg>
<seg id="2496">But these statistics do not show the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the paraguayischen Women of Ana Baiardi, only few of these crimes are actually displayed." on any woman, which will be reimbursed in Paraguay because of mental mistic display, 9 women who do not do this. "</seg>
<seg id="2498">"every woman who will be refunded on every woman who do not refund any two women who do not do this," stated at the end of 2014. "</seg>
<seg id="2499">"because the suicide in Paraguay is not a private crime, the criminal prosecution may not be appropriately documented as many women were murdered by their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2500">"alone until August 2016, journalists have at least 12 cases of women in the land alone."</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator of human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">"according to their estimates, in Paraguay all ten days a woman dies because of violence by men."</seg>

<seg id="2628">"this article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine that covers solutions for environmental problems worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been bred in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"his company offers 114 sorts, such as outredness, the first plant that has grown by NASA-astronaut in space and consumed."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"almost 20 years, Morton's work was done only through its own ingenuity and the question, how many salatballs he can get limits."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"but in the beginning of the 2000s, he noted that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them further."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"the patents are not only used for individual varieties, but also for certain properties like resilience to diseases, a special red or green leaf."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"over the past few years, more and more such patents have been filed on more plants such as cereals or cardboard boxes. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and expert for food security are provided for the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representative of a millennia tradition, Morton is still salad, he still needs more, since its work is more and more efficient than ever more limitations."</seg>
<seg id="2636">"it is, as would lie in a river a rock bread that I have to pull."</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we must now make that now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition," "he says." I think that these patents go on salads too far. "</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they withstand in court, no one can breed any new salatsorte because all features are already patented, and tries to freshen those features that he wants."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, it is very careful and strives to use no material that is being protected as a intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">He is also connected to a movement that is becoming increasingly bigger in the US and everywhere in the world: open source Breeding ("Open Source").</seg>

<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name rather sounds like this would originate from the IT department and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for "Open-Source" -seed) can be inspired by the movement for free "Open Source Software" software that provides alternatives to copyright protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">"it was established in life to ensure that some plant species and gene are not protected as intellectual property and are thus usable for plant breeders."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"in the context of the initiative, shortly Ossi, US breeders can also commit themselves to freely use the seed of them."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed, and they can sell it." open source "" breeder only allow others to breed their seed, and it is not immediately out - two aspects that are prohibited by many plant patente or prescribed. "</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed-owned companies have already joined the initiative since its start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">To be gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the emeried Professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi manager, Jack Kloppenburg are control of the seed and the opportunity to breed new plants, both important for nutrition security and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"seed takes him a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to not use the latter or only little by doing seed with natural resilience."</seg>
<seg id="2652">"Kloppenburg stressed that the" open source "movement does not work with genetically modified plants."</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, cords, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not." to obtain our objective of ecological sustainability, we need control over the mergers of chemical China and Syngenta and monsanto and Bayer who wants to buy good, locally and sustainable manufacturing vegetables, how it is bred for example, like this vegetable is bred.

<seg id="2657">"Ossi-supporters argue that the future of food supplies is jeopardized, since the available genpool due to the ever more numerous intellectual property rights in plant material, which therefore always be subject to tangible."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, Executive director of Ossi, has worked in her PhD thesis with genetic variation when carrots and their availability. she found out that about a third of all card-characteristics were protected as a intellectual property, allowing it to be used for plant breeders either at all or only."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"for other plants there is such estimates not yet, but experts like Luby veraging that mass-grown plants as wheat in an even bigger style are patented as salad or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are bred that they have targeted features - from those who have improved their taste or colour to those due to which they thrive in certain environments and threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders due to more and more patents go. genetic diversity is currently being unnecessary than ever since the changed conditions due to climate change are far worse predictable.</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail, Monsanto-Speaker Carly Scaduto that genetic diversity is generally important and also vital for Monsantos activities. with a total of four combusbanks and cooperation with institutions such as the agricultural Ministry of Economic Affairs and the United States."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it contradicts that intellectual property other breeder supplies, since" patents and the protection of crop protection products "." a patent is basically a plan that can be followed once the patent expired. "</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come with another method to get the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"this means that such protection is not inhibited, but does not promote innovation by providing the public more material and know-how."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton looks that different: 20 years to wait until a patent application, is certainly not innovations."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you have been waiting for a long time to breed, on plants that have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions if you have lost the struggle already."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"however, the main point for Morton is however that genetic resources have always been a general good and continue to remain:" independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive for us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what motivates us, and it won't be impossible if we are not able to continue to use the best and newest genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"in total, Morton has guilt in the concept of itself, plant characteristics:" we create the characteristics not really itself. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants make them out of and as a breeder we have no idea how the plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant breeding-up in the U.S. state Oregon and Ossi managers, there is another important aspect of plant breeding:" who has bred a sorte, they also bred his own values into them. "</seg>
<seg id="2676">"who believes in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, in which cultivation of Herbizide needs to be bred into its varieties of this concept of agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is exactly unambiguous. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized companies (such that move in international markets, but smaller than Monsanto are) patents, they create the most smaller seed-owned companies, even without patents to survive - either reject it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant-hand Frank Morton is searching in his breeding garden Salads.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"Morton is also the view that breeder through the prevention of plant patentent of innovative would:" "it looks like me with my efforts to produce new, stronger than corporations, the patented."</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I need to constantly sell new material for my catalogue, as I know that my competitors normally sell my varieties in a couple of years ago," "he says." "with a patent you are 20 years ahead of competition, making it very nice just makes it very nice."</seg>
<seg id="2683">"although the U.S. seem to be leaders in the" open source "breeding, the concept is now expanding, but quickly around the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (" Centre for Sustainable Agriculture "), describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources, an" open source "seed program works in the center with farmers, and helps them to breed new varieties to meet certain requirements."</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "Open Source" -seed and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German organization Agrecol is working on an" open source "license which ultimately is a formal and legally binding form of Ossi-obligation for breeders in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"(regulations for the breeder differ from country to country, that is not simply one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)"</seg>
<seg id="2688">"in the beginning of November 2016 the executive powers of the European Union, the European Commission, declares that conventional plants should not be patented. thus, it speaks against the current practice of the European patent of patent, which permits patents on conventional plant breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, a statement is not yet a law; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to put this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch organisation Hivos hosted a conference on" Open Source "" seed management banks and representatives of governments, NGOs and seed company from all East-Africa to learn about the "Open Source" -seed movement and the worldwide trend towards patenting seeds.

ANHRI, so it was never so difficult to overcome these objectives, so that all technical possibilities should be exhausted to overcome the blockage and do not re-admit to it, to fulfill our task."</seg>
<seg id="2726">"ANHRI is regarded as the first censored website of a human rights organization in Egypt, after the authorities forced more than two months 21 websites, Arabic-speaking edition of the Huffington Post, and that from Qatar, by Al Jazeera due to the" "support of terrorism". ""</seg>

<seg id="2733">His article is mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">"in a Facebook review, Ziada expressed itself to the blockage by the government and reflected what this means for him:"</seg>
<seg id="2735">"the blogs to lock is very old, however, has a priority at the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi priority; and even if the closure of the blogs might not be significant for the world, it is for two reasons for me:"</seg>
<seg id="2736">"1) It has succeeded to give me the feeling of an insulator condition; a sticking, a attempted murder, unloading of the national Security Council, the blockage of blogs as well as any other website, for which I worked."</seg>
