this is James R@@ isen .
they might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New @-@ York Times Report .
&quot; long before someone had heard of Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen , wrote a book in which it was spectacular , that the N@@ SA bor@@ row@@ ed illeg@@ one of Americans . &quot;
but it is another chapter that should leave a permanent impression .
&quot; in this , he describes an cat@@ astrop@@ hic U.S. co @-@ operation , in which the CIA placed at Iran literally dr@@ afts for an atomic bom@@ b . &quot;
&quot; if the crazy sounds , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible history .
&quot; but do you know , who did not find the chapter at all ? &quot;
the U.S. Government .
&quot; nearly 10 years , the government has determined the R@@ isen and called it to call him to call its inn@@ ate sources . &quot;
&quot; in this train , he became a symbol for the pattern of the government , wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers to judge and journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the first constitutional , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to apply this right , if media does not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the bra@@ ve . &quot;
&quot; so as the government at R@@ isen , he did something that many cour@@ ageous re@@ por@@ ters already did before him : he ref@@ used , and said that he would rather go into prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen also lived with the risk to go into prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , just days before the trial , something exceptional . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , although it would be for years that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped . &quot;
the reason : in time of electronic monitoring the re@@ por@@ ter and springs can always be hidden less .
&quot; instead of moving and reven@@ ge to the statements , this could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ator concerned , without his consent , his phone @-@ wise are concerned , &quot;
&quot; just as his e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , its credit card , and even travel wis@@ ely with the list of his flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Ster@@ ling , a CIA wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers and cr@@ isp@@ y source , to condemn . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
President Obama promised at his approach to protect wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers . but instead , the judiciary has condemned more than all US governments in front of him . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government sees too much of their work as a secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of a wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional referendum , because the government has always more possibilities to view all out . &quot;
&quot; but just as technology of the government allowed to deal with the rights of re@@ por@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; although they can take this from the moment in which they contact , rather than in the neighbour , in the witness . &quot;
&quot; today , there are communication software that has not been written as R@@ isen Book , and it is much more secure than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls . &quot;
&quot; such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ drop , an open @-@ source trans@@ former system for wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers , which was originally developed by the Internet@@ S@@ wart@@ z , which was developed by us against Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation where I have been working . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an email , go to a News website , just like the Washington Post . &quot;
there you can upload documents or send information to any ordinary contact form .
&quot; these will then be encrypted and stored on a server , to which only the respective message agency has access . &quot;
&quot; so the government cannot hide more information secre@@ tly , and many of the information that would request it would not be available from advance . &quot;
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century .
&quot; unfortunately , governments around the world develop new sp@@ ying technologies that all end@@ anger us . &quot;
&quot; it is to make sure that not only technology @-@ denom@@ in@@ ator such as Edward Snow@@ den have a possibility to share mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers , &quot;
&quot; the discussion about ab@@ norm@@ alities during the care of soldiers are modest and of crowded hospitals . or the next environmental workers , the alarm proposes to sig@@ h water of Fl@@ int . or a Wall@@ street insi@@ der that war@@ ned us before the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover crimes , but to protect our constitutional rights . &quot;
thanks .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 the greatest data l@@ ery of history has been published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; revealed that Rei@@ che and powerful &#93; &#91; we b@@ ying Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness by a statement . &#93; &#91; what does this week we have been hidden from news about a L@@ eck of 11 million documents of the law firm Mos@@ bag Fon@@ sec@@ a
the publication of these documents gives a glimp@@ se into the secret world of the tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and Lawyers for companies such as Mos@@ bag Fon@@ sec@@ a go and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , as the whole system works as it works . &quot;
this has already led to the very first very direct consequences .
Islands Prime Minister is re@@ signed .
&quot; also , there are reports that a verb@@ ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad &apos;s stamp @-@ related companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; it is claimed that a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russia &apos;s president Vladimir Putin leads over a narrow friend of children &apos;s days , a famous C@@ elli@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of rich people outside and others who are nervous about the next release , and waiting for the next un@@ covered documents . &quot;
now that sounds like the P@@ lot of an agency or a John @-@ Gr@@ ish@@ am @-@ RO@@ MAN@@ S .
&quot; it seems crying away from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we tackle this ?
&quot; but the truth is : when the rich and powers are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and do not pay all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , streets . &quot;
and this concerns us all .
&quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these Dis@@ closure are phenomen@@ al . &quot;
&quot; the whole world will discuss media and leading politicians , like secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens of some few people to hide and hide their assets -- something that we have been discussing for ten years now . &quot;
&quot; I think many people appears this whole world very conf@@ using , and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot;
I always imagine it as a mat@@ r@@ yo@@ d@@ oll .
&quot; so you have a company in another company , in another company that makes it almost impossible to truly understand who is behind these prayers . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for prosec@@ ution and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what matters is . &quot;
I find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this issue in the United States .
&quot; pres@@ um@@ ably because there were so far no prominent Americans who came to this revelations , this scan@@ dal . &quot;
&quot; well , it is not so that there are no rich Americans who ha@@ v@@ ens their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; but by the principle , after which these ha@@ v@@ ases function , Mos@@ bag Fon@@ sec@@ a less American customers . &quot;
&quot; we would have seen a data l@@ eck from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would have much more cases and examples that have connections to the US . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is so that one needs less information in some US states to specify less information , to create a company as to view a libr@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; this kind of transparency in the US has allowed employees of school @-@ circul@@ ating , school@@ children . &quot;
it does not allow sc@@ atter@@ ing to be particularly gr@@ aded investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a covered re@@ mitt@@ edly into the offices of 13 law@@ yers in Manhattan .
&quot; our investig@@ ators gave himself as African minister , who wanted to bring the sus@@ pic@@ ious money into the USA to buy a yacht , a yacht , a yacht . &quot;
&quot; it really makes us sho@@ cked that everyone up to an attorney to our investig@@ ator &apos;s proposals made , how to transfer his money . &quot;
&quot; these were all pre@@ conditions . none of these law@@ yers took us as a client , and of course anyone was handed over to us money . but it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important to consider this not as cases .
&quot; it is not about a single lawyer , who has under@@ ne@@ sted our conc@@ e@@ aled proposals . &quot;
it is not about a single peak pol@@ ymers , involved in a scan@@ dal . &quot;
&quot; it is about how the system works , through the corruption , tax evasion , poverty and instability . &quot;
&quot; and to cope with this , we must change the rules . &quot;
we have to change the rules to make this kind of behavior .
&quot; this may sound all very tr@@ v@@ ows , as if we could do nothing against it ; as if nothing could ever have changed , as if it is always the rich and powerful ones . &quot;
&quot; but as born @-@ born Optim@@ ist , I really see that a lot has to change . &quot;
in the last few years we have seen benefits to more transparency regarding what the owners of companies affects .
the topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 Summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
&quot; since then , the EU is recorded in central regi@@ sters at the national level , who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls it . &quot;
one of the most uncomfortable facts is that the US is lag@@ ging here .
&quot; representatives of both parties have brought a legislative process in both parliamentary chambers , but this does not make progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how this Panama Dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens as a means of being used to ensure greater transparency in the U.S. and global . &quot;
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
&quot; we need ordinary people who will be angry , when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind proj@@ ectors . &quot;
&quot; we need executives in the economy that stand up and say : &quot; &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need leading politicians who identify the problem and use this way through laws to end this way of transparency .
&quot; together we can now end the in@@ transparent , which now allows this kind of tax evasion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; this is the story , as I almost kid@@ n@@ apped almost and in the trunk of a red ma@@ z@@ an . &quot;
&quot; a day after I had completed my design study , I made an envel@@ ope . &quot;
a guy in the red Maz@@ da was there and looked my stuff .
he bought one of my art works .
he was alone in the city and made straight a road trip through all the country . afterwards he would go to the peac@@ eke@@ eping way .
I invited him on a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; where did you go for today ? &quot;
he made the whole thing worse : &quot; I do not know it . &quot;
&quot; and I thought , &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a dormitory ?
&quot; but I just met him again ! he says he would go to the peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really is planning . I will not escape in the trunk of an Maz@@ das ! &quot;
this is a small trunk !
&quot; then I heard myself , &quot; I have a air@@ mat@@ ress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; one voice in my head said : &quot; &quot; h , how please ? &quot;
at night I was in bed I was star@@ red to the blank@@ et and thought : &apos; Oh man ! what I got there in my house ?
a bo@@ est@@ ran@@ ty sleeps in my living room .
what if he is crazy ?
&quot; I got such a fear that I went out of bed , on the door@@ bell at the door and closed my sleep doors . &quot;
but he was not crazy .
we are still in contact .
the artwork he bought from me today depends on his class@@ room . he is now teachers .
this was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my perspective .
&quot; perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood as a stran@@ gers , actually friends , which are only waiting to be discovered ? &quot;
&quot; to accommodate people on my air@@ mat@@ ress , was normal for me . when I went to San Francisco , I took the air condi@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; we make a time , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am un@@ employed , almost bank@@ rupt , my ro@@ ommate moves off and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that there was a design conference in the city at that time . all the hotels were fully booked .
&quot; I believe , creativity can create it to transform fear into fun . &quot;
&quot; I wrote my best friend and new ro@@ omm@@ ates Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; &quot; Brian , I talked about how we could earn a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk including a mattress and every morning breakfast . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and green &quot; air condi@@ ments and breakfast &quot; &#91; AI@@ R@@ Bed a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happ@@ ily guests were allowed to sleep on wooden floors for more than 20 dollars .
they found it super and we too .
&quot; I am sure , our cheese ham O@@ mel@@ o@@ und tasted completely different because we made them for our guests . &quot;
we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . as we were greeted by our last guest and the door to the castle fell op@@ ted Brian and I went on .
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
the things came into roles .
&quot; my former ro@@ omm@@ ates , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out whether you could make it a business concept .
&quot; we presented to the investors : &quot; we want to create a website on people publicly pictures from their private rooms , their bedrooms , their baths -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when you visit . &quot;
&quot; over the internet , they can then invite people to invite people to stay with them . &quot;
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we wa@@ ited that the ro@@ cket would be .
but she does not .
&quot; nobody who is still completely at Tro@@ st would invest in a shop that allows stran@@ gers to sleep in apartments of other people . &quot;
why ?
because we have lear@@ nt all learned that stran@@ gers are dangerous .
&quot; if one has a problem , one inn@@ ate yourself on the things that you can get good . we could des@@ ig@@ s . &quot;
at the Kunst@@ akademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and h@@ ap@@ tics -- it is the overall experience .
&quot; we learned how to design@@ ate objects , but now we wanted to create confidence by design immense trust between people who have never met before . &quot;
how design can do something ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
&quot; I would like to give you a cost @-@ tasting , what degree of trust we strive for . &quot;
it is a 30 @-@ minute experiment . it will force you out of your comfort .
thum@@ bs up if you are ready .
take your phone into the hand .
now I would like to un@@ lock your mobile phone .
enter your correspon@@ ded mobile phone to your left seat .
&quot; this quietly attraction of panic , you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts , when they first open the door . &quot;
&quot; for the only thing , which is even more personal than your mobile phone , is your home . &quot;
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to keep the mobile phone of a stran@@ ger in your hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
so most guests feel when they stay elsewhere .
only for this reason our company can exist .
only time so who has actually Al Go@@ res mobile phone ?
could you declare that he is the president of the president for the president of the President ?
you can return the phones now .
you now have experienced what kind of confidence we want to build . I want to tell you of some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail on this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbour would have imag@@ ined once with his name , if he could have been telling where his dog or his children are hot ? &quot;
&quot; imagine , you would have 150 be@@ ats that all say : &quot; &quot; he really can really say very well done hand@@ phones ! &quot;
how would you feel then if you would like to give your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ conceived feedback system strengthens the confidence decisive .
in the beginning we have made some things wrong .
it was difficult for people to complete negative assess@@ ments .
&quot; finally , we decided to wait until both host and guest had given their jud@@ g@@ ments before we put it online . &quot;
last week we have discovered something new .
&quot; we have carried out a study with Stan@@ ford . we sear@@ ched , how probably it is that people trust each other , depending on how they are similar to age and location . &quot;
a bit surprising we trust the people most that are most likely to us .
&quot; the more differences we find , the less trust us . &quot;
this is a natural social pres@@ et .
thr@@ illing will be exciting when you add the call of a person -- in our case through Be@@ ur@@ ments .
&quot; if one has less than three assess@@ ments , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but , one has more than ten , changes everything . &quot;
a good reputation of simil@@ arities .
the right design can thus help us overcome some of our deep @-@ rooted preference .
&quot; furthermore , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you can be reasonably priced . &quot;
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if one tells too little , such as &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; , &quot; one gets rather not an answer . &quot;
&quot; one tells you too much , as for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request is also rather not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , e.g. &quot; f@@ ool art works in your apartment ! I do with my family vacation . &quot;
how can I create it with design to produce this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips to which topics you should write something .
&quot; our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help , to overcome our prejudi@@ ces against foreigners . &quot;
what we did not reck@@ oned was the large amount of people who were more than ready to submit these prejudi@@ ces .
here you can see how many people take our offer .
you can recognize three things .
&quot; first , incredibly good luck . &quot;
second : the un@@ ti@@ reless work of our team .
&quot; third : a need , which had not been covered before . &quot;
for us the shop is currently very good .
&quot; of course , there are times when not everything goes smoothly . &quot;
there were guests who have been allowed un@@ allowed parties or rented apartments .
hosts have made guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked on the customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
&quot; I stood at the fore@@ front , when trust was broken . &quot;
there is nothing sh@@ lim@@ mer@@ it than that calls . it is already hurt when I just think .
&quot; the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the inv@@ ocation , was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve . &quot;
luck@@ ily there had only a fraction of a problem by the 123 million .
because people trust each other to rightly .
if trust is working there may be Wonder@@ ful .
one of our guests made holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host took him in the hospital .
he even sp@@ ends blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for travellers , which ten@@ ds due to sitting activities to heart @-@ colored . &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with enough hospitals .
&quot; J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real prot@@ ector that save one life , even though they do not know it correctly . &quot;
&quot; drive one in your own car to the hospital , if you die , and wait while you get a b@@ yp@@ ass . &quot;
&quot; because they do not want it to feel lonely , they bring books by . &quot;
you can even stay longer without charge the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
&quot; of course , not every stay will run . &quot;
but this relationship behind the pure money trans@@ action are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
&quot; when I stum@@ bled for the first time about this concept , I asked me : &quot;
how does the idea of sharing with cash transactions together ?
it is here about an economic trade .
&quot; but it is now just called &quot; &quot; Rental industry &quot; , &quot; the thing is not justified . &quot;
share Economy describes a trade with human relationships promises .
people place a part of itself open and that changes everything .
&quot; when you travel nowadays , this is to compare with Fast Food . it is efficient and reliable , but it is less auth@@ en@@ tically . &quot;
&quot; what would , however , when travelling a rich buffet from local impressions ? &quot;
&quot; what would be , if at any place you would have visited to wait a group there for announ@@ cing it to be thorough , and to show it in a tavern tour of where you have never heard before ; &quot;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
&quot; nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy . &quot;
what if we would like to shape apartments from reason to co @-@ operation ?
how would this look like ?
what if cities would accept the thoughts of a common share ?
&quot; I imagine cities that allow us to society and relationships instead of lon@@ eliness and closing . &quot;
&quot; in the South Korean capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parks that have belon@@ ged to the government . &quot;
were now offered to residents . students who were looking for a b@@ lei@@ gh
&quot; were convey@@ ed to people whose children were moved out , they were started inc@@ ub@@ ator programs , &quot;
&quot; to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . through our platform alone , the night 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be a guest at a stran@@ ger or himself . &quot;
so the idea seems not to be as crazy as it was brought to us .
we did not re @-@ inv@@ ented the wheel .
&quot; hospitality , there was also previously . &quot;
there were already similar websites .
so why has just our works ?
&quot; apart from happiness and timing , we think that one can find the right design with the components of trust . &quot;
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I find that amazing .
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it when a rot@@ er ma@@ z@@ da passed on to me .
&quot; of course , we know that design cannot solve any problem . &quot;
&quot; but when we could help us if it had this great influence , I ask myself , what we can use design soon . &quot;
thanks .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed to under@@ wear a brain @-@ wear ?
or just a delay at the safety check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I do not give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media are the same as I look .
a study y@@ iel@@ ded that 80 % of reporting about Islam and Muslims negative .
&quot; studies show : the Americans mean , most would not know Muslims . &quot;
probably the people do not talk to their competitors .
&quot; for those who have never met a Muslim : it is great , you know . &quot;
I say to you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee @-@ dog -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra . &quot;
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ;
&quot; a separ@@ ators @-@ gym @-@ fan@@ ati@@ cian , &quot;
&quot; and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslims . &quot;
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga s@@ ings , because , Baby , I was not so born . &quot;
I decided to do so .
&quot; when I was 17 years old , I met the decision to ou@@ ten me . &quot;
&quot; no , not as hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual man , like some of my friends , but as Muslims . I decided to carry the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head coverage . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; my femin@@ ist girl@@ friends were un@@ law@@ ful : &quot; why do you oppressed you yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the funny was , at that time it was a femin@@ ist independence , namely opposite the pressure that I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old , to adapt me to a perfect and un@@ reachable beauty ideal . &quot;
I have not only believed in the faith of my parents .
I have delays with the Koran .
&quot; I read it , thought , asked in question , doub@@ ted and credi@@ ble ultimately . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow dedication that deep@@ ened with each reading of the cor@@ an .
the beauty of the rhyth@@ mi@@ k sometimes brings me to crying .
I call myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
have you ever had the feeling that someone you truly percei@@ ves you fully understands and yet somehow loves ?
this is how it feels .
&quot; later I married and began , like all good Egyptians , my career as engineering . &quot;
&quot; I later , after my salvation , a child , and basically lived the &quot; &quot; Egyptian @-@ American dream . &quot; &quot;
then that terrible morning came in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end and looked at the word &quot; &quot; Eil@@ at . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , aircraft flew in building , people sp@@ ran@@ ged from the buildings . &quot;
what was it ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock changed quickly in sensation .
why should you do something ?
&quot; I changed the television channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; bom@@ bs Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; it is not only attacked my country , but in N@@ u turned me the works of others from a citizen into a susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; the same day we had to drive through the Middle West of the USA , to move into a new city and begin with the building study . &quot;
&quot; I remember , as I die -- when we res@@ sing it -- so deeply it went to my seat , and I was the first time to be recognized as Muslims . &quot;
we moved this night into our apartment in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; and then heard , saw and read the war@@ nings of national Islamic organizations that said : &quot; be vig@@ il@@ ted , &quot; &quot; Sei@@ d cau@@ tious , &quot; &quot; po@@ kes in well illuminated areas , &quot; &quot; Ver@@ sam@@ mm@@ elt not . &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gather together for prayer .
&quot; and again the war@@ nings : &quot; &quot; does not go on this first Friday , the mosque might be a goal . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage of me .
&quot; the feelings were understan@@ da@@ bly un@@ fil@@ tered and I heard also of attacks on Muslims or by people who held for Muslims , into the free and struck . &quot;
there were really fire@@ places on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
&quot; because the people who had attacked this country , have attacked our country . &quot;
I defe@@ ated the anger of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to explain themselves constantly .
&quot; I have nothing for questions , I love questions . &quot;
&quot; there are the alleg@@ ations , which are hard . &quot;
nowadays we can actually hear people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims .
when will we go out ? &quot;
some people want to con@@ quer Muslims and mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church such as tum@@ or in the body of the USA .
it is only the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or fine ?
you know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tum@@ or can be removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tum@@ or just under observation .
the alternatives are meaning@@ less because the question is wrong .
&quot; Muslims are , like all other Americans , no tum@@ or in the body of the USA , but a life @-@ life organ . &quot;
thanks !
Muslims are invent@@ or and teachers , Er@@ sth@@ el@@ fer and Olympi@@ oni@@ ans . &quot;
will the closing of mos@@ ques in America secure ?
perhaps there will be some parking lots free but not stop terror .
&quot; the regular visit of a mosque leads to the people of other faith toler@@ ant , and greater civil participation . &quot;
&quot; and as I was a leader of the police in the area of Washington , DC recently , : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or in bed before a computer .
&quot; while radi@@ ating process , one has noted that he will start online . as a First the person is cut off from their church , even from their family , so that the extre@@ mi@@ ties believe that the person believes the true Muslims , and anyone who ab@@ ide their behavior and their ideology is a tra@@ itor or by faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to avoid radi@@ alisation , we need to keep the people to go to the mosque . &quot;
some are still claim@@ ing that Islam be a non@@ violent religion .
finally a group as the IS founded their brut@@ ality with the Koran .
&quot; Muslims , as a mother , as a person , believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
&quot; but we would add to their imagination , if one recogni@@ zes it as representatives of 1,6 billion believers . &quot;
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ K@@ lux Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology reasons on their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
&quot; but if one casts a look at it , she does not drives them what they read in their &quot; Holy Scriptures &quot; . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that they can read these things into the Scriptures .
an outstanding I@@ mam told me a amazing story :
&quot; a girl came to him , because she could have appe@@ aled to join the IS . &quot;
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said , the problem was exactly the opposite . every cl@@ ergy , with whom she had spoken , she brought to the silence , and told her that their wrath is to bring her sense to inj@@ ustice in the world , it would only be in trouble . &quot;
&quot; nothing inspired and something that had given their sense , she was a main goal for the instrument@@ alisation by extre@@ mi@@ sts who spoke to a solution . &quot;
this I@@ mam established the link to God and their church .
&quot; instead of protecting them for their hum@@ ility , he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world . &quot;
&quot; what she learned in the mosque , keep it before it to join the IS . &quot;
this was an insight that is concerned by the Islam@@ opho@@ bia and my family .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect any other ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affects our democracy each day based on our minds ?
one study -- actually indicate several neuro@@ scientific studies -- to show : if we fear for at least three things .
&quot; we do not accept an authorized government system , con@@ form and prejudi@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; a study reveals : if you have reported test messages , in which negative about Muslims have been reported , they voted more military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circum@@ cis@@ ion of rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just a academic problem .
&quot; if you &apos;re looking when the mood for Muslims on the above @-@ oss -- between 2001 and 2013 -- this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in the fore@@ front of the war and during two constitu@@ ent periods .
&quot; so , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Mos@@ lem terror , as I expected it . &quot;
&quot; it can actually be a tool for mani@@ pulation of the public to under@@ mining the foundation of a free society , the reasonable and well informed citizens . &quot;
the handling of Muslims is a Early War@@ n@@ mark .
&quot; we might feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear leaves us all . &quot;
&quot; in the assignment of Coll@@ ective debt , it is not just about to explain themselves . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was an ath@@ l@@ ete .
&quot; he was held at the dental Faculty , talented , promising , promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would say to me that he was the est , rich@@ est person was , whom they knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her life cycle . she was aston@@ ished and said :
&quot; when is from my quar@@ ry , such a sealed young man has become ? &quot;
&quot; just a few weeks after visiting Su@@ z@@ anne at her brother and his wife , her neighbour , Cra@@ ig Stephen H@@ icks , she was killed in the afternoon to visit . he did it in her apartment like with a execution , after having expressed statements on Muslims on his Facebook page . &quot;
he took eight times at De@@ ah .
&quot; fan@@ ati@@ cism cannot be only mor@@ ally , but also deadly . &quot;
thus back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
are we going to the mosque or we remained safe at home ?
&quot; we see it and for us it was not a slight decision , for it was about which America we left to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can exercise our religion freely . &quot;
we decided for the mosque .
&quot; with our son in the children &apos;s seat , we drove to the mos@@ quito , with high pressure on the mosque . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , and passed my shoes , went into the prayers , and what I saw , left me . &quot;
the hall was rest@@ less filled .
&quot; then the I@@ mam made an announcement , bed@@ time , and called our guests were welcome , because the half of the gathered were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , A@@ thei@@ sts , credit@@ or and non @-@ believers who had come to attack us but to assist us . &quot;
at this moment I have coll@@ ap@@ sed .
&quot; these people were there , because they had courage and sympathy and prejudi@@ ces . &quot;
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be sure to go back number ?
or join those who connect my : we are better than that .
many thanks .
thanks beautiful !
&quot; Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve . &quot;
&quot; but I ask myself , what do you say that you might think that you are a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a mind@@ set with draft , thus an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say that decei@@ ve not . I am completely normal .
I am not an exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am so usually as it is allowed .
&quot; if one looks at Muslims around the world , and I did that with the greatest ever carried out study on Muslims all over the world , people want ordinary things . &quot;
&quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want to work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
so I am in no way an exception .
&quot; if people appear like an exception to rule , then usually the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to rule . &quot;
H@@ W : many thanks . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
&quot; what started as a platform for Bast@@ ler , is shortly before , a milli@@ on@@ den@@ shop . &quot;
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial threats . possible , this is made in research institutions worldwide . &quot;
&quot; before air packages in our social consciousness , a autonom@@ ous fleet of aircraft in the F@@ RAC Centre in France has a six meter high tower built in 1 500 brick . some years ago , they began to fly with rop@@ es . &quot;
by inter@@ locking passengers high speed and acceler@@ ation in a closer space .
you can also build sel@@ f@@ ent structures .
they have learned to deal with turbul@@ ence with turbul@@ ence and generally react to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our aim is to cross the limits of possible in the autonom@@ ous flight .
&quot; so that a system works autonom@@ ous , it must know collective , where in space there are mobile objects . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at the ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tas@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demo@@ s , we use a new localization technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , a off@@ springs of our laboratories . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
&quot; each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space , calculations on board what the machine should do . &quot;
&quot; external commands can be run at the highest E@@ ben@@ e. g. &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; land &quot; . &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called H@@ eck@@ starter .
&quot; a flight , which tries to beat two fingers with a fl@@ ap . &quot;
&quot; like other star@@ ters , it is in advance flight efficiently , much more efficient than hel@@ icopter in all its variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most of the star@@ ters it can fluctu@@ ate , and thus has considerable advantages at start and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always one kitt@@ ens . &quot;
a limitation of rear @-@ rigid is that they are sensitive to tur@@ mo@@ il like wind@@ boards .
we develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the aircraft will be able to reg@@ ained the optimum position and can be improved through exercise .
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often present fundamental abstract questions that penet@@ rate the core of the matter . &quot;
such a question would be for example : what is the smaller number of movable parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
hel@@ icopter are known about as machines with a thousand mot@@ ion@@ less parts that join forces to hurt you .
decades ago we were able to fly remot@@ ely pilot equipment that had only two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a h@@ eck@@ ru@@ der .
&quot; long , we discovered that flying with just one works . &quot;
&quot; this is the Mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically easiest ; it was inv@@ ented from short time . &quot;
&quot; it has only one moving part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no fl@@ aps , hinges and har@@ ness , no other actu@@ ators or control surfaces , only a prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simp@@ el , happens in the interior life very much , so that it can be stable and can move in space . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear @-@ star@@ ters . to bring it to the flies , I have to throw it right . &quot;
&quot; the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood , it &apos;s right to throw , when everyone is looking for , is small , therefore I show you a video that was fil@@ med yesterday evening . &quot;
&quot; when the Mon@@ osp@@ inner is a exercise in gen@@ esis , this machine is here , the om@@ ni@@ cer with his eight prop@@ ell@@ ers , a exercise in abundance . &quot;
what do you do with all this abundance ?
they see that he is only symmet@@ rical .
therefore it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
&quot; thus , he receives the greatest possible ability , &quot;
&quot; moving in space in all directions , no matter what direction it is fil@@ med or even how he rot@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the field of inter@@ active rivers of the eight prop@@ ell@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; some of them is in@@ conceivable in models , the rest is learned directly by flying . &quot;
see you this .
&quot; when flying to be part of our everyday life , they need to be extremely secure and reliable . &quot;
this machine is composed of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller engines .
this turns into the clo@@ ck@@ wise
and the other against the clo@@ ck@@ wise .
&quot; when one builds them , they act like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ru@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; but there is something wrong -- one engine or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery , the machine can continue to fly , if restricted . &quot;
&quot; we will now demonstrate , by making a half fl@@ at@@ able . &quot;
the last demonstration examined synthetic spon@@ ges .
&quot; the large number of autonom@@ ous , co @-@ ordin@@ ated units allows a range of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we participated in southern micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- every single weighs less than a sli@@ ce of bread -- and allow them with localization technology and algorithms .
every unit knows where in space it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hopefully you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine as dr@@ as@@ et wants to be a flying lamp@@ shade at Broadway .
&quot; of course , it is difficult to pre@@ di@@ ct the influence of this technology . &quot;
for types like us is the reward in the development and the creation act .
&quot; it serves as a memory , how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures , they are in so attractive way . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
many thanks .
&quot; before 1.3 billion years ago , in a very far distant gal@@ axy two black holes are getting faster , you walked so the mass of tri@@ ples in a tenth of pure energy . &quot;
&quot; this short moment , it shining bright than all the stars together in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the whole of us known universe . &quot;
it was a very big boy .
but your energy put them off in the form of light --
we are finally talking about black holes .
the whole energy was released into the space period itself and the universe explo@@ ded into gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
&quot; after all , we arrange the events in time . &quot;
1.3 billion years ago was a multi @-@ zel@@ lig@@ ent life on Earth .
&quot; since then , the earth has brought a lot of things : cor@@ als , fish , plants , SA@@ U@@ RI@@ ER , people and -- God stand for us -- even the Internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago , a group was especially mu@@ ddy -- RA@@ I Weiss from MIT , K@@ IP thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver of the Cal@@ Tech -- a huge laser det@@ ector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which arise approximately by colonial black holes . &quot;
most stopped it for crazy .
&quot; but enough people recognized them as crazy com@@ ies , so that the US National Science Foundation was funded by its idea . &quot;
&quot; after decades @-@ long development , construction , design and extremely hard work , they built the Det@@ ector LI@@ GO : the Laser Inter@@ fer@@ om@@ eters @-@ Observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; in the following times the precision of LI@@ GO could be significantly increased , which improved the recognition performance . &quot;
therefore it is called Advanced LI@@ GO .
&quot; at the beginning of September 2015 , LI@@ GO was launched for a last test run to clarify a few smaller , stub@@ born problems . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September 2015 , just a few days after the start @-@ up of the det@@ ector , smo@@ ked the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two col@@ li@@ ous black holes through the earth . &quot;
they went through you and me
and also through the det@@ ector .
Scott H@@ ugh@@ es : only two moments in my life were emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the departure of my to@@ d@@ kran@@ z father .
basically this were the fruits of my life .
&quot; all that which I had worked is no longer science @-@ fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott H@@ ugh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he studied gra@@ vit@@ ational waves from black holes and their through observ@@ atories such as LI@@ GO measurable signals . &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a lob@@ ster in the foot of space and time .
&quot; passing the shaft , the space and its entire content shall be stretched into one direction and the other is st@@ amp@@ ed into the other . &quot;
to illustrate the fac@@ tion of lect@@ ur@@ ers in courses to relie@@ ve theory often a really al@@ ber@@ ly dance .
&quot; stretching and dust , stretch and dust . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridic@@ ulous . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September , for example , each of us was stretched up by the waves of the waves and stri@@ ves . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; that is about 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1st Dar@@ um , one explained the LI@@ GO staff for crazy . &quot;
&quot; with a five @-@ kilometer long laser Det@@ ector , and this is already absurd , this length would have to be measured exactly as a replacement of the radius of an atomic nucle@@ us . that &apos;s gr@@ ot@@ es@@ k . &quot;
at the end of his classic text over gra@@ v@@ itation
&quot; K@@ IP thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder LI@@ GO@@ s , the hunt for the waves following : &quot; &quot; the technical difficulties when building such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot;
&quot; but physi@@ cists are fin@@ ish@@ able , and with the support of the public will certainly be overcome all obstacles . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
&quot; back to LI@@ GO . Scott holds , LI@@ GO should be more than one ear than one eye . &quot;
I want to explain what this means .
&quot; visible Light has a wav@@ el@@ ength , which is much smaller than the things around us : facial extracts , the size of your cell . &quot;
this is quite handy . because so you can customize an image or a map of things by taking advantage of the coming light around you .
in killing is different .
audi@@ ble tones have a wav@@ el@@ ength of up to 15 metres .
&quot; that &apos;s why it is very difficult , actually impossible to make a picture of things that mean you especially much : &quot;
the face of your child is about .
&quot; instead we listen to certain properties like pitch and height , rhythm and volume , in order to close the story behind it . &quot;
&quot; now , just Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob under@@ breaks it . &quot;
&quot; D@@ rief Bob , &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we cannot provide easy images of objects in the space .
&quot; but by watching changes in the am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can hear their stories . &quot;
at least lie for LI@@ GO the measured frequencies in audi@@ ble area .
&quot; so if we convert wave @-@ bra@@ ve into sh@@ all , we can hear all of the book literally . &quot;
&quot; the gravity to lau@@ gh , can tell us about the coll@@ ision of two black holes that my colleague Scott has already been very long . &quot;
&quot; SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , circles simply : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
&quot; turning the two bodies very quickly , you hear the same circles with an additional sound exchange . that sounds like : W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u ! &quot;
it is a kind of movement @-@ wr@@ apping that character@@ izes in the wav@@ el@@ ength .
&quot; AA : on 14 . September 2015 -- a date that at least I must never forget -- heard LI@@ GO Fol@@ der : &#91; Sur@@ ren@@ des sound &#93; J@@ em@@ and , who knows how to listen to it as sound of -- ... two black holes each with 30 @-@ fold sun mass , which can turn around as fast as the sticks of your mix@@ er . &quot;
AA : think we think about what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the dense bodies in the universe , one with a mass of 29 sun@@ ns , the other with a mass of 36 s@@ uns , revol@@ ve one hundred times per second , before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces
fantastic .
and we know it because we heard it .
therein lies the permanent importance of LI@@ GO .
&quot; LI@@ GO p@@ aves a completely new way to explore Al@@ ls , as it was never possible . &quot;
on this way we can listen to the universe and the invisible .
much in the space we can -- not see -- practically or basically -- not see .
&quot; a super nova , for example . I would like to know why mascul@@ ine stars in Super@@ nov@@ ae explo@@ de . &quot;
they are very useful . from them we learned a lot about the universe .
&quot; however , the exciting physical operations occurred at the core , which lies behind thousands kilometers of iron , carbon and si@@ licon . &quot;
we will never pass through that these op@@ ak are .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penet@@ rate iron , as if there would be more transparent glass . I would like to explore the first minutes of the Al@@ ls , but we will never see it , since the urine is covered through its own desc@@ endant . &quot;
&quot; using Gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , it should be possible to back up until the beginning . &quot;
&quot; and most importantly : I am optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen we will never see , which we will never see , and of which we have no idea of what we just discover when we listen . &quot;
&quot; in fact , LI@@ GO took place in the first kick @-@ out things that we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the LI@@ GO project , says to this subject : ME : the type of stars , the black holes emerged as LI@@ GO they are observed , are the din@@ os@@ au@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient body of prehistoric times . the black holes are so@@ unded the suction no@@ chen for our arche@@ ological work . &quot;
&quot; LI@@ GO enables us to completely different angles on the events in the universe , to the emergence of the stars and ultimately on how we eman@@ ate from this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge is now to be as bold as possible .
thanks to LI@@ GO we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and circles of cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a brand new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in the All .
because what could be beautiful than the urine ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thanks .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; a year long I would say too &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; before I fear@@ ed myself . &quot;
&quot; no matter if it made me nervous to say me in uncomfortable situations , I would like to say &quot; Yes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
I wanted to be live on TV ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
wanted to start with the show@@ room ?
&quot; no , no , no , but yes , yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : exactly what to do , w@@ ov@@ or I fear@@ ed , was my fear . &quot;
&quot; my fear , speeches to hold , my social fear -- Pu@@ ff , gone . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , my life changed . &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; changed me . &quot;
but there was a certain yes that changed my life on an unexpected . it started with a question of my youngest .
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , called for un@@ expl@@ ain@@ able reasons all &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if they were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; kitt@@ ens , I need milk for my beak . &quot;
&quot; she asked me once I could play with her , when I was just on the go . and I said , &quot; yes . &quot;
this yes was the beginning
&quot; of a new way of life in my family . from there to fluctu@@ ate me , always with them to play , as soon as you go to it . no matter what I &apos;m going to do , or where I go , I say always Yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I am not perfect , but I paint myself very much . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , to my children , to our family . &quot;
&quot; but it also has an intrigu@@ ing side effect : just before short , I actually stood out that the &quot; Yes &quot; -@@ S@@ ear@@ ing for playing with my children my career saved . &quot;
I have a real dream job .
I am author . I think of things that awak@@ ens you to life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I Cre@@ ate television . I produ@@ ci@@ ere television .
&quot; I make television , in a great style . &quot;
&quot; in this TV season , I am responsible for doing 70 hours of program to the world . &quot;
&quot; four television programs , 70 hours TV . three to four shows are simultaneously in production . &quot;
&quot; each shipment has hundreds of jobs , which previously existed before . &quot;
the budget for an episode of a TV set may lie between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
&quot; a new episode all nine days of four shows , i.e. all nine days 20 million dollars television , four television programs , three hours TV , three episodes , 21 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours of television , &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV shows are running on Thursday morning .
all over the world run my series in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spect@@ ators .
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of this 70 TV @-@ hours are ship@@ ments that I have created itself , and not only produced , so still ob@@ el@@ essly , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four television series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fire , all around the world . &quot;
do you know who is still doing ?
&quot; nobody , that &apos;s why am I a Titan . &quot;
dream job .
I do not want to impress with it .
&quot; I say it , because I know what you think if the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
&quot; I say to you , so that all of you who work so hard if you work out a company , a country or a budget to take a business or a household , so that I am saying : I understand that I don &apos;t understand it , I understand that there is not just a dream job to dream . &quot;
&quot; it is all a job , all work , all the reality , all blood , all swe@@ at -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m working much , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I am deep@@ ened into the work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work creates always a land from nothing .
&quot; it is , when I set troops on , when m@@ alt I on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; as a result , you have a high tone , ri@@ pe a mar@@ athon . &quot;
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; it is creative , mechan@@ ically , exhau@@ sting and in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ating , funny and destruc@@ tive , cru@@ el and reasonable . and the best thing about it is the sums . &quot;
there is such a change in me when working well runs .
&quot; a sums begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the sums hear like a busy road , I could always drive on her . &quot;
&quot; many people take , when I talk to them the sums that I over@@ s writing , that writing me joy . &quot;
do not understand me wrong that does it .
&quot; but the sums up -- when I began working and work with television production , when I began working and work and work together , I discovered this thing , this sw@@ am , this energy . the sums ! &quot;
the sums is more than writing .
the tot@@ als is action and activity . the sums is a drug .
the tot@@ als is music . the sums is light and air .
the tot@@ als is the voice of God in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a tot@@ als , then you can not stand differently from size . &quot;
&quot; feeling that can not be different than to strive for size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called the sums .
or perhaps it also means a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it is called genius .
perhaps it is the ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; I just know that I am not made for failure , and I just know that I love the bu@@ zz . &quot;
&quot; I will only say to you , I am a Titan , and I know that I will not ask it . &quot;
&quot; to make a clear one : the more successful I will , the more episodes , the more energetic bo@@ ons , the more work there are , the more things at the same time , the more I write history , the more expectations I have history , the more expectations there are . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more you need to work . &quot;
and what does I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , not true ? &quot;
&quot; the land , which I create , the mar@@ athon that I go , the army , the high tone , the sums , the sums , the sums . &quot;
I like this sum@@ ms . I love the sums .
I need the sums . I am the sum@@ ms .
am I only this sum@@ ms ?
and then stops the sums .
&quot; revised , over@@ lap , hidden . &quot;
the sums stops .
&quot; now , my three daughters are acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to the truth that her mother is a single working class . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my mom will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; bad , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da @-@ land . &quot;
there are the children of a Tit@@ ans .
you are Baby @-@ Tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the tot@@ als heard . &quot;
the sums of the engine w@@ alled .
I did not loved my work anymore . the engine was out .
the sums did not come back .
my tot@@ als was broken .
&quot; I made the same things as always : the same title @-@ work , 15 hours days , passed , no rep@@ ent@@ ance , no rep@@ ent@@ ance , a Titan sleeps not , is not on , with all the heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no sums .
in me was silence .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
&quot; I was a lecture , &quot;
&quot; everything was gray , I just had no fun more . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sum@@ ms and the sums I was .
&quot; so what makes you do if what you do , the work you love , suddenly f@@ aded ? &quot;
&quot; I know , some may think : &quot; &quot; Heu@@ l thee out , with the author @-@ titanium . &quot;
&quot; but you know you doing it , you are doing , you love to be a teacher to be a painter , a painter , Bill Gates , one loves to know one another and that gives one the sums you knew when the sums have stops , when the sums stops , who is you then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; when the song of my heart list@@ ens , can I survive in silence ? &quot;
and then my &quot; southern states @-@ Kell@@ ner@@ in &quot; a question .
&quot; I am on the way to the outside , late in and she says : &quot; &quot; Mama , do you be playing ? &quot;
&quot; and I already will say No , when I will be conscious of two things : &quot;
&quot; first , I have to say yes to everything and secondly , she called me not . &quot;
&quot; they do not call any more &quot; &quot; kitt@@ ens &quot; . &quot; &quot;
when is this happened ?
&quot; I ver@@ b it , when I am Titan and my sw@@ am praying , and here everything is changing my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says : &quot; &quot; Mama , do you be playing ? &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; yes . &quot; &quot;
this is nothing special .
&quot; we play and her sisters come up , we lau@@ gh much and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; . &quot; &quot;
nothing exceptional .
&quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in the lon@@ eliness and in the absence of the Sum@@ mens , I cannot do anything except . &quot;
I am focuss@@ ed .
I am quiet .
&quot; the land , which I create , the mar@@ athon that I walk , the army , the canvas , the high tone - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; all that exists are glu@@ ed finger and hum@@ id kis@@ ses , delicate voices , vig@@ il@@ ly sti@@ p@@ ens and the song , in which there is Los@@ ing , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Royal Queen . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air at this place is so short that I can barely breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe me .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me trig@@ gers itself .
a mental door goes on and an energy club comes in .
&quot; and that is not immediately , but it happened . &quot;
I feel it .
the sums slowly come back .
&quot; no full volume , hardly there , it is sil@@ ently , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there . &quot;
&quot; not the sums , but a sums . &quot;
and now I feel when I would know a magic secret .
but let us remain in the matter .
it is love . this is all .
no magic . no secret . just love .
it is something we have forgotten .
&quot; the tot@@ als , the working environment , the Titan@@ ium housing , which is only the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who are you are when I say to you , who I am , when I am writing by broad@@ casts and television hours , and how functioning my brain , then I have forgotten what is real sums . &quot;
the sums is not power and it is not working specifically .
it is dependent on the pleasure .
the real sums is dependent on love .
the tot@@ als is the flow that comes from the li@@ fel@@ ong .
true sums is self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; real sums igno@@ res the pressure of the story , which to erle@@ ting tasks , the expect@@ ation and the pressure . &quot;
the real sums is simple and original .
&quot; the real sums is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps fle@@ e to me God the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ? &quot;
it is just love .
&quot; we all need a bit more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; once my child wants to play with me , I will say Yes . &quot;
I rule this for a fixed rule so I can rid myself as a work@@ ah@@ olic of any debt .
&quot; it is law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice , if I want to hear the sums again . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so simple . I am not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
play is not enough for me how to work .
the truth is hur@@ ting ;
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
&quot; I always work , because I love it . &quot;
I prefer working at the workplace as da@@ heim .
&quot; this conc@@ ession is painful , because what a person is working rather than to be home ? &quot;
&quot; well , I . &quot;
&quot; I honestly , I call me &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; -- &quot;
I have to have problems .
&quot; that I am to relaxed , is none of them . &quot;
&quot; we r@@ asen in the garden around , before and back , and forth . &quot;
we make small dance parties ;
we are singing and play ball .
we cer@@ ating so@@ ap bub@@ bles .
&quot; here I feel overwhel@@ med by mostly rigid , ab@@ sent and ba@@ ff@@ led . &quot;
I always have traveled to my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
&quot; my children show me how you live , and the sums of the universe fills me . &quot;
I play and play until I ask myself : why did we ever hear about playing ?
you can also say it ! let them always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you hold me for nai@@ ve for a day@@ dreams .
&quot; you probably have right , but you can do it also ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
&quot; my kids want to play at most 15 minutes with me , until they plain , that they would like to make something different . &quot;
&quot; it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes I replaced a Marien@@ k@@ äfer or K@@ eks .
&quot; and my teen @-@ daughter whole 15 minutes long with me , I am mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; there are only 15 minutes , more it does not require . &quot;
everybody can bring 15 minutes to the piece yourself in a bad mood day !
15 minutes at the piece !
&quot; no cell , no laundry , no distr@@ action . &quot;
&quot; the day is short : dinner , the children of praying . &quot;
but 15 minutes are dr@@ illed !
&quot; my children are my Well @-@ being , my world . it is not to be the children . it is to feel the sum@@ ms to have a place for his soul fri@@ gh@@ ty . &quot;
it is not about playing with your own children . it is about joy ;
to play the &quot; Play &quot; in general .
treat yourself in the 15 minutes !
find out what you do good .
find out and keep it out .
&quot; I am not perfect in it . I fail and I si@@ ege . friends , reading books , read the day -- &quot;
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; is short for everything I have given , when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in education , when I wanted to meet even more and more . &quot;
&quot; 15 minutes at the piece , why not go full 15 minutes &quot;
what can I be wrong ? nothing !
the sums came back in my spare time . the tot@@ als seems to return if I do not work .
working does not work without games .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months opens a door , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again . I hear an unknown mel@@ ody , it fills me and my soul . I lost myself to new ideas . I n@@ ut@@ ze it into full and love my work again . &quot;
I like the sums but I don &apos;t love it .
I do not need it .
I am not the sw@@ am ; the sums it is not me ... not anymore .
so@@ ap bub@@ bles and sti@@ cky finger , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is now my sw@@ amp .
the sums of life .
the sums of love .
&quot; the tot@@ als of work is part of me , but just a part . and so I am so grateful . &quot;
&quot; it is me snow , that I am a Titan . I have never seen a Titan , the journey to Jerusalem . &quot;
I said yes to less work and to play more .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is even functioning . my camp@@ fire still burn .
&quot; the more I play , the more happ@@ ier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more clearly my head is . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I listen to the sum@@ ms . the land , which I am fri@@ es , the mar@@ athon that I go , the v@@ ases , the high tone , the sums , the sums , the sums of life : the sums of life . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this tot@@ als , the more this more unusual , b@@ lowing , naked and new feeling of life in me wide . less Titan -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel exactly this tot@@ als , the more I know who I am . &quot;
I am author . I think of things I awake to life .
&quot; this belongs to the job , which means to live its dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of that job , &quot;
because a dream job should be a little tr@@ äum@@ er@@ ous .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; to less work and to play more .
titles have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thanks beautiful .
I am Neuro@@ surgery .
as most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human trag@@ e@@ dies .
&quot; I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a serious stroke or after an automobile accident . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ ch@@ ir@@ ur@@ gen it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other bodily organs , has a very low capacity for self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a severe injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , heavy disability . &quot;
that is probably the reason why I was functional Neuro@@ surgery .
what is a functional neuro@@ sur@@ geon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the neur@@ onal functions through various surgical measures .
&quot; certainly they have heard of one of the most prominent , the &quot; Tief@@ enh@@ ir@@ n@@ stimulation &quot; . &quot; it impl@@ anted an electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons so that neuro@@ logical function has been improved . &quot;
it really is an amazing technology . she has improved the fate of patients with Park@@ inson who suffered from severe tre@@ m@@ ors and heavy pain .
&quot; however , neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean Ne@@ uro healing . &quot;
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geon is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I want to show you that we are very close to you .
with some help the brain can help themselves .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was leading th@@ at@@ ine and worked day and night in the emergency .
often I used patients with sk@@ ull @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
&quot; you need to imagine that at sk@@ ull @-@ brain @-@ trau@@ mas , the brain increases and the cran@@ ial pressure increases . &quot;
&quot; to save life , you have to dimin@@ ish the cran@@ ial pressure . &quot;
but sometimes you have to remove a part of a s@@ wollen brain .
&quot; instead of throwing the s@@ wollen brain &apos;s mass , we decided to analyse with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist , the brain . &quot;
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
&quot; to let cells of a tissue piece grow , it is comparable to small children who are taken out of your families . &quot;
&quot; you have to find the proper diet , temperature , moisture and the environments to let them thri@@ ve . &quot;
this is what we had to do with these cells .
after many trials it was Jean @-@ François .
he saw in his micro@@ scope .
this was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , which are surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells . &quot;
perhaps you still know from the bi@@ ologi@@ ans that stem cells un@@ ri@@ pe cells can turn into every cell type of the organism .
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ cal of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to get this kind of stem cells from the surface of the brain material in the OP .
we made a further fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast .
they never die ; they are imm@@ or@@ tal .
but these cells res@@ umes differently .
they were slowly and after a couple of weeks they even died .
&quot; so we saw a new , wei@@ rd cell population , which saw as stem cells , but it was different . &quot;
we needed long to understand how they came .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are hot Dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our magnific@@ ation cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
at the stage of the fet@@ us they ensure the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay with us ?
we do not know .
&quot; we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , since we find them in higher concentr@@ ations close to brain violations . &quot;
but this is not as safe .
but one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells .
we stand in front of a potential cell source that allows brain .
we had to prove it .
&quot; so , we decided to develop an experiment . &quot;
&quot; we wanted a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ lingu@@ istic areas , and then the cells were just as cultiv@@ ating as Jean @-@ François did . &quot;
and they subsequently mark the colour in order to pursue them in the brain .
in the last step we impl@@ anted it at the release of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ ologist transc@@ ending transpl@@ ant -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ transpl@@ ant .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we impl@@ ant these cells in normal hierarchy tissue ? and what will happen if we impl@@ ant the same cells in den@@ ial brain tissues ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we were able to work with monkeys .
&quot; in the first scenario we impl@@ anted the cells in a healthy brain , and we observed that she had been completely disappeared after a few weeks , they would go back home . the room is already occupied , they are not needed , so they disappear . &quot;
&quot; in the second scenario we added a injury to and impl@@ anted exactly the same cells , and now the cells remained -- they knew neur@@ ons to mature neur@@ ons . &quot;
here you can see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been impl@@ anted .
&quot; the evidence that they demonstrate are these small points . these are the cells , which we were vit@@ ro in vit@@ ro . &quot;
here we could not stop .
can these cells also help a monkeys to recover from a brain &apos;s infringement ?
so we exercise monkeys with a manual reaction task .
you had to take food pell@@ ets from a tablet .
they made them very well .
&quot; when they had reached a stable skill level , we have achieved the hand in the motor Cor@@ tex motor field . &quot;
&quot; then the monkeys were paraly@@ sed , they could no longer move their hands anymore . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen with people , they lost spont@@ aneously up to some degree , just like after one stroke . &quot;
&quot; the patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to relax with the help of sculp@@ tural Brain mechanisms . you can relax at some extent , just like the monkey . &quot;
&quot; when we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we impl@@ anted its own cells . &quot;
&quot; on the left you see the monkey , which spont@@ aneously recovered . &quot;
it can take about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from violation .
it is not as precise and not as fast .
&quot; now , see when we impl@@ anted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the Rei@@ m@@ pl@@ antation . &quot;
I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can free@@ ze them and later use .
&quot; we can use them in other neuro@@ path@@ ological models , for example with Park@@ inson . &quot;
but our dream is still to impl@@ ant her in people .
&quot; I really hope , that I can show you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal yourself . &quot;
many thanks .
&quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne , this is wonderful , I am sure that right now , several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who need that . &quot;
I definitely .
&quot; of course , the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you start clinical trials in the human being . &quot;
J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the greatest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results you have to fill about two kil@@ ograms of papers and forms to go through this kind of studies .
BG : this is understandable ; the brain is very delicate and so .
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get the permission to start the clinical studies . if you continue in the future , how many years it will take , until someone can come to hospital and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : this is difficult to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial . &quot;
will it allow us the authority to start it soon ?
then we must perform this study with a small group of patients .
&quot; it takes time for a long time to select patients , perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to do this kind of treatment . &quot;
then you have to apply this to a multi@@ cent@@ ric study .
you first have to really prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it is safe . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne thanks for your visit to TED and that you told us about it .
BG : many thanks .
democracy .
we in the West make a great mistake to consider it as natural .
&quot; we do not see democracy as the fragile plant that it is in reality , but as inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to look at it as an imm@@ utable reality .
we believe that capitalism is inev@@ it@@ ably led to democracy .
this is not true .
&quot; Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great neigh@@ bor in Beijing have clearly demonstrated that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth while politics is completely un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; in fact , democracy comes with us in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ ambiguous that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- not affect the austerity programs that have been realised in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at this moment I thought that there could be no better justi@@ fication for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my inc@@ ub@@ ous friends who would repeat to me , if they would change anything . &quot;
at this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for genuine democracy .
&quot; I ask you , together with me to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of an error , we could save the democracy but that we need a true and def@@ ective democracy . &quot;
&quot; for without democracy our societies are ma@@ iled , our future d@@ ü@@ ster and our great , new technologies . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of waste , I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction , the currently our tavern is threatened . &quot;
I call it the &quot; Gem@@ ini @-@ Det@@ ox @-@ Parad@@ ox . &quot;
&quot; a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the school @-@ mountain , who thro@@ ws its long shadow over the U.S. , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all know the deb@@ tor , &quot;
but only a few recognize its Gem@@ ini .
&quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash , which belongs to the twi@@ sting as@@ parag@@ us and corporations , which could be too sc@@ ared there , where it would be productive and in@@ comes with whom you could produce the debt mountain , and even all the things you need to urgently needed for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; in the past 3 months , in the US , in England and the euro area , 3.4 Bil@@ li@@ onen invested US dollars , such as industrial sectors , machines , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment , and so on and so on . &quot;
&quot; 3.4 Bil@@ li@@ onen &apos;s US dollars also sounds a lot of money until one compar@@ es it with the 5,@@ 1 tr@@ illion US dollars , which at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing , except the stock exchange and for the property prices . &quot;
&quot; so debt and un@@ productive capital make the tw@@ ins , which is not the same by the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the outcome are stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the U.S. , Japan and Europe , and consequently , a low level of economic demand that could not invest in which they would not invest . just like Ö@@ di@@ p@@ us father , who from fear , the prophecy of the or@@ acle could be true that his son would kill him when he grows , &quot;
the circumstances leading the circumstances that Ö@@ di@@ p@@ us lead him k@@ ills .
this is my ha@@ irs with capitalism --
&quot; his extremely caring art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to further develop human talents , and especially to finance the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies , which are critical for the salvation of the earth . &quot;
so Democracy is the solution ?
I believe . but before we proceed : what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ el@@ es defined democracy as the social form in which the Free and the poor as a majority control the government .
the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy will of course end up too many --
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake to min@@ ate the significance of ath@@ en@@ ic democracy due to these closures . &quot;
&quot; the decision for the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that they had the working poor in freedom of expression , and not only the right to freedom of expression , but more important and crucial that they gave them the right to political co @-@ determination with the same sing@@ ular weigh@@ ting in questions of the prosec@@ ut@@ or . &quot;
the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not been kept too long --
&quot; like a candle , which is very bright , it is also rapidly spread . &quot;
&quot; however , our today &apos;s liberal democr@@ acies have no roots in ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na C@@ arta , in the glorious Revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on the free citizens and the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na C@@ arta , which was ultimately a stat@@ ute for the ruling class . &quot;
&quot; the liberal democracy came only upon , as a complete separation of politics and economy is possible and the democratic process was established in politics during the economy -- so the world of corporations -- a democracy @-@ free zone . &quot;
&quot; in our present democr@@ acies since the time , in which this separation of politics and economy began , an intoler@@ ance struggle between the two instead of taking the economy gradually desc@@ ends . &quot;
are you wonder@@ ing why the politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not at a de@@ generation of their DNA .
&quot; it is because that one cannot be in the government today , and still not in power because the power of politics is v@@ ander@@ ed into the economy and are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my ha@@ ste with capitalism .
&quot; when you think about it , it is in about such as a herd of smoke , which is thus sustain@@ ably the animals , of which they nour@@ ishes , dec@@ imal by the end therefore . &quot;
&quot; similarly , it is with the economy that has declared politics so far as far as the self @-@ caused economic crisis itself . the power of corporations grows , political goods will be as@@ certain@@ ed to reduce inequality , the overall economic demand and the managing director of the corporations are too sc@@ ented to invest the cash of their business . &quot;
&quot; the successful of capitalism the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; &#91; the people &#93; from democracy , the higher the tw@@ ins , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the welfare of humanity . &quot;
&quot; if that &apos;s true , it is obvious that we need the politics and the economy again , and it would be better if the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; &quot; re@@ tains to control such as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
&quot; by the way , this is not a new idea . &quot;
the Marxist Left had already had this idea about 100 years ago and it was not very qu@@ ir@@ ky good .
&quot; the doctrine of the deb@@ acle of the Soviet Union should be , that the working poor can only be reg@@ ained by a miracle like in ancient Athens without new species of brut@@ ality and waste . &quot;
but there is a solution : the working poor !
capitalism is doing it by replacing low @-@ time employees by automation and robots .
&quot; the problem is , so long economy and politics are separate areas , the autom@@ ating the tw@@ ins , and social conflicts are deeper , just as it is very soon as I think -- in countries like China will come . &quot;
&quot; so we must re@@ unite the economy and re@@ unite the areas of business and politics , and thereby consider that we will appear again in a path@@ ological surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cr@@ acy that appear the film &quot; Matrix &quot; as a documentation . &quot;
&quot; so the question is not whether capitalism has brought the technical achievements , which he has brought forth . &quot;
&quot; the more interesting question is whether capitalism is dis@@ solved by a D@@ yst@@ ro@@ scopy , similar to that in &quot; &quot; star Tre@@ k &quot; , &quot; or through something that put the society in &quot; &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; , &quot; in the machinery of the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ ener &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long talks to the meaning of life . &quot;
&quot; I think , we may be optim@@ istic . &quot;
&quot; so what did it look , how could it look like this &quot; &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; &quot; like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; similar D@@ yst@@ scopy ? &quot;
&quot; in practical implementation I would like to give you , in all short , some examples call . &quot;
&quot; in the field of companies : please make a capital market prior to which you deserve money , while you work and in which your capital follows you from a working place to next , from a company to the next , and the company -- no matter which one is currently working -- is the property of those who currently work in the company . &quot;
&quot; then , all income from capital and dis@@ solve and the concept of wage labor is completely out@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; no distinction between those who belong to the enterprises , but do not work in it , and employees working there that the company does not belong . no dov@@ es more between capital and labour , no major gaps between investment and co@@ ars , and ultimately no asc@@ ending constraints . &quot;
&quot; in the field of global political economy , please imagine that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , presented by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , is represented in the interest of the whole of humanity . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , imagine that the whole world trading in this currency will be tr@@ aded -- we call it &quot; &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; , &quot; in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; &quot; -- and every government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade defic@@ it or the merchant of the respective country into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; also present that this fund is investing in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world , in which investment means . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John Ma@@ yn@@ ard Ke@@ yn@@ es proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time there was not the technical means to put it into practice .
&quot; today , we have seen it , particularly ahead of the background of a re@@ unified policy and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world that I describe you is simultaneously liberal , in which they preferred to have privileged people , and Marxist , because they buried the separation of capital and work in the tr@@ ash of history , and ke@@ yn@@ esi@@ ans , globally ke@@ yn@@ esian . &quot;
but above all others it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
we will wake up in such a world
or will we disp@@ ose into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar de@@ yst@@ ro@@ scopy ?
the answer depends on how we work together politically .
&quot; it is in our hands , and we do it better democratic . &quot;
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you write yourself in your biography itself as a liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything of what I have just said , then Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... do not work that the technological development will generate such massive decrease in the overall economic demand , which is Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers as &quot; long term stagn@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; through the transmission of this crisis from one portion of the earth to the next , as we &apos;re currently experiencing it , it will not only be our democr@@ acies dest@@ abil@@ ise but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is correct , then Marx is quite relevant . &quot;
&quot; likewise , as Hay@@ ek , that &apos;s why I am a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and like Ke@@ yn@@ es , and that &apos;s why I am also fully equipped . &quot;
BG : actually and now we are well .
Y@@ V : if one is not wir@@ r you do not think enough .
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosoph@@ ical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein that said . BG : in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner the Red@@ ner , you made very clear what you think of the view of the West in China . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democr@@ acies we have the sem@@ bl@@ ance of democracy .
&quot; as I said in my talk , we have limited democracy to politics during the area where most of the economy -- is a completely democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in some respects , if I may say that pro@@ voc@@ ative must say that China today resem@@ bles the England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; -- remember -- we tend to combine liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake , historically considered . &quot;
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , as John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was particularly sc@@ ep@@ tical that concerns the democratic development .
&quot; what you can watch in China now , resem@@ bles very much the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; to do this , China is now doing what the West has done itself in the 19th century , sm@@ ells even to hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I am sure that many list@@ eners curious to your experiences as a finance minister in the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I know that that comes .
BG : yes ...
how did you look back to the first half of six months ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ appoint@@ ing , because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the eurozone . &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the eurozone , &quot;
&quot; namely , from self @-@ suff@@ iciency to say , and the continu@@ ance den@@ ial that a massive ver@@ f@@ use by the eurozone ran , and continues to be massi@@ vely threatened by the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- the way , the first proposal was , who revealed this den@@ ial -- &quot;
&quot; it is right to do . unfortunately , the powers within the eurozone is elected within the European group , continue to deny the den@@ ial . &quot;
&quot; but you know , what is coming . &quot;
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; if one tries to obtain a economic system that is not viable , by political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism in life , it will be hes@@ it@@ ant perhaps if the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rupt and destruc@@ tive . &quot;
BG : what change do you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future when we do not change its structure .
BG : do you have any errors in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who look back -- seriously ...
&quot; if there is a finance minister , or any minister , who claims after 6 months in office , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he did not have mistakes , then that is a dangerous person . &quot;
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest bug was to under@@ signed the request for the extension of the debt program end of February .
&quot; I believed that there was an honest interest on the sides of the don@@ ors , to find a common solution . &quot;
but that was not there .
&quot; they merely wanted to bring our government only because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the obj@@ ections , which were running through the eurozone . &quot;
they did not want to admit that they have been cat@@ astrop@@ hic in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominated GDP .
there is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; none from the tro@@ ika of the don@@ ors , who raised us this policy : &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive day of talks , you seem to be right pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is facing someone , the Europe lives and loves . &quot;
my greatest fear is that the eurozone is not survived .
&quot; for if they are not survived , the released tile @-@ forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not be cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences , but for the global economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economic situation in the world .
&quot; if we allow ourselves to strike the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , won@@ dro@@ us it will be as well as for the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope that you are wrong at this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you so you were at TED . &quot;
Y@@ V : thanks .
&quot; by Roy Price most of them have never heard , although he probably is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 . &quot;
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for very many of you .
this goes back to deciding which I met for three years ago .
Roy Price is conduc@@ tance at Amazon Studios ;
the TV @-@ production company of Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a yellow @-@ term and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; films , TV , technology , Tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for providing the shows and content to produce the Amazon .
&quot; of course , this is a very hard fighting industry . &quot;
there are so many TV series that Roy cannot select any one .
&quot; he must find shows that are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he has to find shows that are right on the right side . &quot;
this curve is the measurement distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating will show up from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review received .
&quot; your show will be rated with nine and higher , this is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows like &quot; Bre@@ aking Bad &quot; , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones &quot; , &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows , the addi@@ c@@ tive , where you ask a season , your brain asks , &quot; &quot; where is there any more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left side , here at this end , shows how &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what goes to that end of the curve . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price does not worry about the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to provide &quot; to@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he makes more thoughts about the average endurance , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply won &apos;t . &quot;
so he must make sure he really is on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is available , and of course it is also the first time at Amazon as something makes , therefore I want to risk nothing at nothing . &quot;
he wants success created .
&quot; he needs guarantee success , so he holds a contest . &quot;
&quot; he takes many ideas for TV Shows and choose from an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode each of these shows and puts it online , where they can watch everyone free of charge . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon does not find stuff out there , you can still find it right ? &quot;
millions of viewers look at this episodes .
&quot; however , they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows . &quot;
they are observed by Roy and his team who take everything .
&quot; you can capture when you start the show , when one pays off , which parts you jump or check again . &quot;
&quot; they collect millions of data to decide with these data , which show them should produce . &quot;
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process these and resulting from the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com over four rep@@ ublic@@ ans US sen@@ ators . &quot;
they did this show .
does someone know the name of this show ?
&quot; Alpha House , &quot; but Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many of this show may remember , because they were not so good . &quot;
&quot; it is only an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve 7,@@ 4 is and Alpha House , at 7.5 -- so something above average , but not exactly what they worked on Roy and his team . &quot;
&quot; about at the same time when another company has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking for this a super @-@ show and he also uses data to do , but he does something different . &quot;
&quot; instead of holding a contest , he and his team looked at the existing data about the Net@@ fli@@ x spect@@ ators , so the reviews that they give the shows , whose shows they like etc . &quot;
&quot; then use these data to find these small details about the spect@@ ators : what shows they like , which producers , which actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the parts together , they entered a wagon and decided not to make a sit@@ com about four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards &quot; . Net@@ fli@@ x has a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,@@ 1 review on this curve . therefore , exactly where they wanted to . &quot;
&quot; of course , the question is what happened here ? &quot;
one has two very com@@ peti@@ tive data sealed companies .
they connect these many data and it works great for one of them but not for the other company .
what is that ?
because logic somehow defe@@ ated that this should work with everything .
&quot; when one coll@@ ects millions of data , for a decision that one meets , then one should meet a good decision . &quot;
it has 200 years to statistics as back @-@ up .
it is optimized with very powerful computer .
&quot; the minus , what you can expect is good TV , or ? &quot;
&quot; when data analysis is so not working , then this is a terri@@ fying because we live in a time when we take more and more statistics to take serious decisions , far beyond TV . &quot;
knows someone here the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
&quot; nobody . OK , that is even good . &quot;
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one can ever come in touch with this software . come in touch with this software you are in prison .
&quot; if anyone is in prison in the US and around dism@@ iss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge is done or not . &quot;
&quot; just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad , it will be a person good or bad . &quot;
&quot; moderate television , 22 minutes , this can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that these data analysis , despite of the many data , &quot;
&quot; this is not always the best results , this is not that a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data . &quot;
even the data can also be sealed is wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google does sometimes make mistakes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that they are able to tell by data analysis of flu , the lim@@ lim@@ men &apos;s way to pre@@ tensions -- by data analysis of the Google research . &quot;
it worked wonderful and was a great news release . the success det@@ ox in a release in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked fl@@ aw@@ less , year round by year until it suddenly no longer worked , &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; it simply didn &apos;t work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data de@@ test companies like Amazon and Google ab@@ outs sometimes something .
&quot; despite all of these mistakes , data flows into decisions of life -- at the workplace , in case of loss , in medicine . &quot;
so we should rather make sure that data are helpful .
&quot; I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ assisted gene@@ tics -- an area where some very smart people un@@ imagin@@ able many data to make serious decisions , such as the decision for a cancer therapy &quot;
or the development of a drug . over the years I have recognized some samples over the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be distributed .
&quot; you have to solve a complex problem , just do two things : &quot;
&quot; as a First er@@ ect this problem in its parts , so that you can analyze the parts ; as a second one set the parts again to put a decision . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you need to do this several times , but there are always two things : apart and put together again . &quot;
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how power@@ fully , can only help create a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to make the parts again and then come to a decision .
&quot; for this , there is another tool and we all possess all : our brain . &quot;
&quot; if there is something in which the brain is good , it is parts and pieces come back together , even if the information is incomplete to take a good release -- especially when it is the brain &apos;s brain . &quot;
&quot; that is why I believe , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they have data and mind , where they also went into the process . &quot;
&quot; they use the data to better understand their audience , what else does not have been able to understand them . but the decision , how to take all these parts , and make it a show such as &quot; House of Cards &quot; , &quot; that was not in the data . &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show which meant that they entered a great personal risk with this decision .
&quot; in contrast , Amazon did this in the wrong way . &quot;
&quot; they used to control all their decisions , first than they selected for TV ideas , then as they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show . &quot;
it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; they say to us the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data is helpful for better decisions , but I believe that things go wrong , when data begin to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how power@@ fully they are , data are just a tool , and to not forget it , this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will ...
&quot; before there was data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
&quot; it is also called &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; . &quot; it is amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or no matter you only need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- exactly here in this moment . &quot;
I will return it later with a technique of technology .
&quot; so far , I have made some decisions in my life so far , whereby I should have heard in retrosp@@ ect on the ball . &quot;
&quot; however , as you of course know if you have the data available , you would like to replace these through something much more cl@@ ashes , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the basic building .
&quot; perhaps the ball cl@@ ever@@ er and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately , it lies on us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as very encouraging message , that despite the large amount of data still pays off to make decisions , an expert in what you do is doing and risks . &quot;
&quot; in the end it is not the data , but the risks associated with which you land at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thanks beautiful .
