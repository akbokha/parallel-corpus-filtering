<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">They might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New-York Times Report.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before someone had heard of Edward Snowden, Risen, wrote a book in which it was spectacular, that the NSA borrowed illegone of Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a permanent impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in this, he describes an catastrophic U.S. co-operation, in which the CIA placed at Iran literally drafts for an atomic bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if the crazy sounds, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible history.</seg>
<seg id="8">"but do you know, who did not find the chapter at all?"</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. Government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"nearly 10 years, the government has determined the Risen and called it to call him to call its innate sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this train, he became a symbol for the pattern of the government, whistleblowers to judge and journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the first constitutional, the media have the right to publish secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"but it is impossible to apply this right, if media does not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so as the government at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters already did before him: he refused, and said that he would rather go into prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen also lived with the risk to go into prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, just days before the trial, something exceptional."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, although it would be for years that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in time of electronic monitoring the reporter and springs can always be hidden less.</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of moving and revenge to the statements, this could also do his digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so the investigator concerned, without his consent, his phone-wise are concerned,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"just as his e-mail data, financial and banking information, its credit card, and even travel wisely with the list of his flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblowers and crispy source, to condemn."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised at his approach to protect whistleblowers. but instead, the judiciary has condemned more than all US governments in front of him. "</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government sees too much of their work as a secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of a whistleblowers to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional referendum, because the government has always more possibilities to view all out."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just as technology of the government allowed to deal with the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"although they can take this from the moment in which they contact, rather than in the neighbour, in the witness."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today, there are communication software that has not been written as Risen Book, and it is much more secure than normal e-mails or phone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such technology is Securedrop, an open-source transformer system for whistleblowers, which was originally developed by the InternetSwartz, which was developed by us against Aaron Swartz, and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation where I have been working."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an email, go to a News website, just like the Washington Post."</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information to any ordinary contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">"these will then be encrypted and stored on a server, to which only the respective message agency has access."</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government cannot hide more information secretly, and many of the information that would request it would not be available from advance."</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments around the world develop new spying technologies that all endanger us."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is to make sure that not only technology-denominator such as Edward Snowden have a possibility to share misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblowers,"</seg>
<seg id="39">"the discussion about abnormalities during the care of soldiers are modest and of crowded hospitals. or the next environmental workers, the alarm proposes to sigh water of Flint. or a Wallstreet insider that warned us before the next financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover crimes, but to protect our constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016 the greatest data lery of history has been published.] [the "Panama Papers" revealed that Reiche and powerful] [we bying Robert Palmer of Global Witness by a statement.] [what does this week we have been hidden from news about a Leck of 11 million documents of the law firm Mosbag Fonseca</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of the tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and Lawyers for companies such as Mosbag Fonseca go and say:" okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up? "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, as the whole system works as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the very first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Islands Prime Minister is resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">"also, there are reports that a verbally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad's stamp-related companies in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is claimed that a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russia's president Vladimir Putin leads over a narrow friend of children's days, a famous Cellists."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of rich people outside and others who are nervous about the next release, and waiting for the next uncovered documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the Plot of an agency or a John-Grisham-ROMANS.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems crying away from you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we tackle this?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is: when the rich and powers are able to hide their assets in tax havens and do not pay all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, streets."</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, Global Witness, these Disclosure are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"the whole world will discuss media and leading politicians, like secret tax havens of some few people to hide and hide their assets -- something that we have been discussing for ten years now."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people appears this whole world very confusing, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it as a matryodoll.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so you have a company in another company, in another company that makes it almost impossible to truly understand who is behind these prayers."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what matters is."</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this issue in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="63">"presumably because there were so far no prominent Americans who came to this revelations, this scandal."</seg>
<seg id="64">"well, it is not so that there are no rich Americans who havens their assets in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="65">"but by the principle, after which these havases function, Mosbag Fonseca less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"we would have seen a data leck from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would have much more cases and examples that have connections to the US."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, it is so that one needs less information in some US states to specify less information, to create a company as to view a libration."</seg>
<seg id="68">"this kind of transparency in the US has allowed employees of school-circulating, schoolchildren."</seg>
<seg id="69">It does not allow scattering to be particularly graded investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covered remittedly into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigators gave himself as African minister, who wanted to bring the suspicious money into the USA to buy a yacht, a yacht, a yacht."</seg>
<seg id="75">"it really makes us shocked that everyone up to an attorney to our investigator's proposals made, how to transfer his money."</seg>
<seg id="76">"these were all preconditions. none of these lawyers took us as a client, and of course anyone was handed over to us money. but it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">"it is not about a single lawyer, who has undernested our concealed proposals."</seg>
<seg id="79">It is not about a single peak polymers, involved in a scandal. "</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works, through the corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and to cope with this, we must change the rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">We have to change the rules to make this kind of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">"this may sound all very trvows, as if we could do nothing against it; as if nothing could ever have changed, as if it is always the rich and powerful ones."</seg>
<seg id="84">"but as born-born Optimist, I really see that a lot has to change."</seg>
<seg id="85">In the last few years we have seen benefits to more transparency regarding what the owners of companies affects.</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 Summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU is recorded in central registers at the national level, who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls it."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the most uncomfortable facts is that the US is lagging here.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have brought a legislative process in both parliamentary chambers, but this does not make progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how this Panama Disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens as a means of being used to ensure greater transparency in the U.S. and global."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">"we need ordinary people who will be angry, when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind projectors."</seg>
<seg id="93">"we need executives in the economy that stand up and say:" "transparency is not good for business." ""</seg>
<seg id="94">We need leading politicians who identify the problem and use this way through laws to end this way of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="95">"together we can now end the intransparent, which now allows this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">"this is the story, as I almost kidnapped almost and in the trunk of a red mazan."</seg>
<seg id="97">"a day after I had completed my design study, I made an envelope."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda was there and looked my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my art works.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and made straight a road trip through all the country. afterwards he would go to the peacekeeping way.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him on a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "where did you go for today?"</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing worse: "I do not know it."</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought," Oh, man! "</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a dormitory?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just met him again! he says he would go to the peace corps, but I don't know if he really is planning. I will not escape in the trunk of an Mazdas!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">"then I heard myself," I have a airmatress. you can sleep in my living room. "</seg>
<seg id="112">"one voice in my head said:" "h, how please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was in bed I was starred to the blanket and thought: 'Oh man! what I got there in my house?</seg>
<seg id="114">A boestranty sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such a fear that I went out of bed, on the doorbell at the door and closed my sleep doors."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork he bought from me today depends on his classroom. he is now teachers.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my perspective.</seg>
<seg id="121">"perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood as a strangers, actually friends, which are only waiting to be discovered?"</seg>
<seg id="122">"to accommodate people on my airmatress, was normal for me. when I went to San Francisco, I took the air condiments."</seg>
<seg id="123">"we make a time, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I am unemployed, almost bankrupt, my roommate moves off and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that there was a design conference in the city at that time. all the hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">"I believe, creativity can create it to transform fear into fun."</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote my best friend and new roommates Brian Chesky:" "Brian, I talked about how we could earn a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk including a mattress and every morning breakfast."</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and green "air condiments and breakfast" [AIRBed aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happily guests were allowed to sleep on wooden floors for more than 20 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">"I am sure, our cheese ham Omelound tasted completely different because we made them for our guests."</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them through the whole city. as we were greeted by our last guest and the door to the castle fell opted Brian and I went on.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">The things came into roles.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommates, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out whether you could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"we presented to the investors:" we want to create a website on people publicly pictures from their private rooms, their bedrooms, their baths -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when you visit. "</seg>
<seg id="139">"over the internet, they can then invite people to invite people to stay with them."</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the rocket would be.</seg>
<seg id="142">But she does not.</seg>
<seg id="143">"nobody who is still completely at Trost would invest in a shop that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we have learnt all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if one has a problem, one innate yourself on the things that you can get good. we could desigs."</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">"we learned how to designate objects, but now we wanted to create confidence by design immense trust between people who have never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">How design can do something?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">"I would like to give you a cost-tasting, what degree of trust we strive for."</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-minute experiment. it will force you out of your comfort.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up if you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your phone into the hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your corresponded mobile phone to your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">"this quietly attraction of panic, you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts, when they first open the door."</seg>
<seg id="158">"for the only thing, which is even more personal than your mobile phone, is your home."</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the mobile phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So most guests feel when they stay elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Only time so who has actually Al Gores mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you declare that he is the president of the president for the president of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can return the phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You now have experienced what kind of confidence we want to build. I want to tell you of some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail on this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbour would have imagined once with his name, if he could have been telling where his dog or his children are hot?"</seg>
<seg id="170">"imagine, you would have 150 beats that all say:" "he really can really say very well done handphones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel then if you would like to give your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-conceived feedback system strengthens the confidence decisive.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we have made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for people to complete negative assessments.</seg>
<seg id="175">"finally, we decided to wait until both host and guest had given their judgments before we put it online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we have discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we have carried out a study with Stanford. we searched, how probably it is that people trust each other, depending on how they are similar to age and location."</seg>
<seg id="178">A bit surprising we trust the people most that are most likely to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less trust us."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social preset.</seg>
<seg id="181">Thrilling will be exciting when you add the call of a person -- in our case through Beurments.</seg>
<seg id="182">"if one has less than three assessments, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but, one has more than ten, changes everything."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation of similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can thus help us overcome some of our deep-rooted preference.</seg>
<seg id="186">"furthermore, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you can be reasonably priced."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if one tells too little, such as" "Hi!", "one gets rather not an answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"one tells you too much, as for example:" I have problems with my mother "-- -- the request is also rather not accepted."</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g." fool art works in your apartment! I do with my family vacation. "</seg>
<seg id="191">How can I create it with design to produce this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips to which topics you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">"our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help, to overcome our prejudices against foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not reckoned was the large amount of people who were more than ready to submit these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">"first, incredibly good luck."</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the untireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">"third: a need, which had not been covered before."</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the shop is currently very good.</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are times when not everything goes smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have been allowed unallowed parties or rented apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have made guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked on the customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">"I stood at the forefront, when trust was broken."</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing shlimmerit than that calls. it is already hurt when I just think.</seg>
<seg id="207">"the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the invocation, was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve."</seg>
<seg id="208">Luckily there had only a fraction of a problem by the 123 million.</seg>
<seg id="209">Because people trust each other to rightly.</seg>
<seg id="210">If trust is working there may be Wonderful.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host took him in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even spends blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travellers, which tends due to sitting activities to heart-colored."</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with enough hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">"Javier and Alejandra are real protector that save one life, even though they do not know it correctly."</seg>
<seg id="218">"drive one in your own car to the hospital, if you die, and wait while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they do not want it to feel lonely, they bring books by."</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer without charge the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">"of course, not every stay will run."</seg>
<seg id="223">But this relationship behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I stumbled for the first time about this concept, I asked me:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with cash transactions together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is here about an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but it is now just called" "Rental industry", "the thing is not justified."</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade with human relationships promises.</seg>
<seg id="229">People place a part of itself open and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">"when you travel nowadays, this is to compare with Fast Food. it is efficient and reliable, but it is less authentically."</seg>
<seg id="231">"what would, however, when travelling a rich buffet from local impressions?"</seg>
<seg id="232">"what would be, if at any place you would have visited to wait a group there for announcing it to be thorough, and to show it in a tavern tour of where you have never heard before;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">"nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy."</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to shape apartments from reason to co-operation?</seg>
<seg id="236">How would this look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the thoughts of a common share?</seg>
<seg id="238">"I imagine cities that allow us to society and relationships instead of loneliness and closing."</seg>
<seg id="239">"in the South Korean capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many parks that have belonged to the government."</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered to residents. students who were looking for a bleigh</seg>
<seg id="241">"were conveyed to people whose children were moved out, they were started incubator programs,"</seg>
<seg id="242">"to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. through our platform alone, the night 785 000 people in 191 countries will be a guest at a stranger or himself."</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea seems not to be as crazy as it was brought to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not re-invented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">"hospitality, there was also previously."</seg>
<seg id="246">There were already similar websites.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why has just our works?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from happiness and timing, we think that one can find the right design with the components of trust."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find that amazing.</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it when a roter mazda passed on to me.</seg>
<seg id="253">"of course, we know that design cannot solve any problem."</seg>
<seg id="254">"but when we could help us if it had this great influence, I ask myself, what we can use design soon."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed to underwear a brain-wear?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or just a delay at the safety check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I do not give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media are the same as I look.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study yielded that 80% of reporting about Islam and Muslims negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">"studies show: the Americans mean, most would not know Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably the people do not talk to their competitors.</seg>
<seg id="267">"for those who have never met a Muslim: it is great, you know."</seg>
<seg id="268">I say to you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee-dog -- double espresso, with cream extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted;</seg>
<seg id="271">"a separators-gym-fanatician,"</seg>
<seg id="272">"and I am a practicing, spiritual Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not like Lady Gaga sings, because, Baby, I was not so born."</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">"when I was 17 years old, I met the decision to outen me."</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as homosexual man, like some of my friends, but as Muslims. I decided to carry the Hijab, my head coverage."</seg>
<seg id="277">"" "my feminist girlfriends were unlawful:" why do you oppressed you yourself? "</seg>
<seg id="278">"the funny was, at that time it was a feminist independence, namely opposite the pressure that I felt as 17-year-old, to adapt me to a perfect and unreachable beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only believed in the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have delays with the Koran.</seg>

<seg id="356">How does it affect any other?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affects our democracy each day based on our minds?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually indicate several neuroscientific studies -- to show: if we fear for at least three things.</seg>

<seg id="360">"a study reveals: if you have reported test messages, in which negative about Muslims have been reported, they voted more military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of rights of American Muslims."</seg>

<seg id="362">"if you're looking when the mood for Muslims on the above-oss -- between 2001 and 2013 -- this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the forefront of the war and during two constituent periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">"so, Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Moslem terror, as I expected it."</seg>
<seg id="365">"it can actually be a tool for manipulation of the public to undermining the foundation of a free society, the reasonable and well informed citizens."</seg>

<seg id="409">"before air packages in our social consciousness, a autonomous fleet of aircraft in the FRAC Centre in France has a six meter high tower built in 1 500 brick. some years ago, they began to fly with ropes."</seg>

<seg id="411">You can also build selfent structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to deal with turbulence with turbulence and generally react to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our aim is to cross the limits of possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"so that a system works autonomous, it must know collective, where in space there are mobile objects."</seg>
<seg id="416">"in our laboratory at the ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks."</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos, we use a new localization technology of Verity Studios, a offsprings of our laboratories."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">"each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space, calculations on board what the machine should do."</seg>
<seg id="420">"external commands can be run at the highest Ebene. g." "and" "land". ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called Heckstarter.</seg>
<seg id="422">"a flight, which tries to beat two fingers with a flap."</seg>
<seg id="423">"like other starters, it is in advance flight efficiently, much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"in contrast to most of the starters it can fluctuate, and thus has considerable advantages at start and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always one kittens."</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear-rigid is that they are sensitive to turmoil like windboards.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the aircraft will be able to regained the optimum position and can be improved through exercise.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often present fundamental abstract questions that penetrate the core of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be for example: what is the smaller number of movable parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopter are known about as machines with a thousand motionless parts that join forces to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago we were able to fly remotely pilot equipment that had only two movable parts: a propeller and a heckruder.</seg>
<seg id="435">"long, we discovered that flying with just one works."</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the Monospinner, the mechanically easiest; it was invented from short time."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only one moving part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no flaps, hinges and harness, no other actuators or control surfaces, only a propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanically simpel, happens in the interior life very much, so that it can be stable and can move in space."</seg>
<seg id="440">"however, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear-starters. to bring it to the flies, I have to throw it right."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the likelihood, it's right to throw, when everyone is looking for, is small, therefore I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening."</seg>
<seg id="442">"when the Monospinner is a exercise in genesis, this machine is here, the omnicer with his eight propellers, a exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What do you do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">Therefore it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">"thus, he receives the greatest possible ability,"</seg>
<seg id="447">"moving in space in all directions, no matter what direction it is filmed or even how he rotates."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the field of interactive rivers of the eight propellors."</seg>
<seg id="449">"some of them is inconceivable in models, the rest is learned directly by flying."</seg>
<seg id="450">See you this.</seg>
<seg id="451">"when flying to be part of our everyday life, they need to be extremely secure and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is composed of two separate two-propeller engines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns into the clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against the clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">"when one builds them, they act like a high-performance quadrucopter."</seg>
<seg id="456">"but there is something wrong -- one engine or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery, the machine can continue to fly, if restricted."</seg>
<seg id="457">"we will now demonstrate, by making a half flatable."</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examined synthetic sponges.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the large number of autonomous, co-ordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">We participated in southern micro-Quadcopter -- every single weighs less than a slice of bread -- and allow them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Every unit knows where in space it is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully you motivate these demonstrations to think new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine as draset wants to be a flying lampshade at Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">"of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology."</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us is the reward in the development and the creation act.</seg>
<seg id="466">"it serves as a memory, how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures, they are in so attractive way."</seg>

<seg id="477">"since then, the earth has brought a lot of things: corals, fish, plants, SAURIER, people and -- God stand for us -- even the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="478">"about 25 years ago, a group was especially muddy -- RAI Weiss from MIT, KIP thorne and Ronald Drever of the CalTech -- a huge laser detector to search for gravitational waves, which arise approximately by colonial black holes."</seg>

<seg id="480">"but enough people recognized them as crazy comies, so that the US National Science Foundation was funded by its idea."</seg>

<seg id="482">"in the following times the precision of LIGO could be significantly increased, which improved the recognition performance."</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="484">"at the beginning of September 2015, LIGO was launched for a last test run to clarify a few smaller, stubborn problems."</seg>
<seg id="485">"on 14 September 2015, just a few days after the start-up of the detector, smoked the gravitational waves of the two collious black holes through the earth."</seg>

<seg id="492">"all that which I had worked is no longer science-fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he studied gravitational waves from black holes and their through observatories such as LIGO measurable signals."</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a lobster in the foot of space and time.</seg>

<seg id="496">"stretching and dust, stretch and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on 14 September, for example, each of us was stretched up by the waves of the waves and strives. the elongation of an average person was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"that is about 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1st Darum, one explained the LIGO staff for crazy."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five-kilometer long laser Detector, and this is already absurd, this length would have to be measured exactly as a replacement of the radius of an atomic nucleus. that's grotesk."</seg>

<seg id="503">"but physicists are finishable, and with the support of the public will certainly be overcome all obstacles."</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">"back to LIGO. Scott holds, LIGO should be more than one ear than one eye."</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible Light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than the things around us: facial extracts, the size of your cell."</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite handy. because so you can customize an image or a map of things by taking advantage of the coming light around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">In killing is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible tones have a wavelength of up to 15 metres.</seg>
<seg id="511">"that's why it is very difficult, actually impossible to make a picture of things that mean you especially much:"</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child is about.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead we listen to certain properties like pitch and height, rhythm and volume, in order to close the story behind it."</seg>
<seg id="514">"now, just Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob underbreaks it."</seg>
<seg id="516">"Drief Bob,"</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot provide easy images of objects in the space.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by watching changes in the amplitude and frequency of waves, we can hear their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least lie for LIGO the measured frequencies in audible area.</seg>
<seg id="521">"so if we convert wave-brave into shall, we can hear all of the book literally."</seg>
<seg id="522">"the gravity to laugh, can tell us about the collision of two black holes that my colleague Scott has already been very long."</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, non-rotating holes, circles simply: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">"turning the two bodies very quickly, you hear the same circles with an additional sound exchange. that sounds like: Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu!"</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement-wrapping that characterizes in the wavelength.</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on 14. September 2015 -- a date that at least I must never forget -- heard LIGO Folder: [Surrendes sound] Jemand, who knows how to listen to it as sound of --... two black holes each with 30-fold sun mass, which can turn around as fast as the sticks of your mixer."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: think we think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the dense bodies in the universe, one with a mass of 29 sunns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, revolve one hundred times per second, before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know it because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the permanent importance of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">"LIGO paves a completely new way to explore Alls, as it was never possible."</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the universe and the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in the space we can -- not see -- practically or basically -- not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">"a super nova, for example. I would like to know why masculine stars in Supernovae explode."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. from them we learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">"however, the exciting physical operations occurred at the core, which lies behind thousands kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never pass through that these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gravitational waves penetrate iron, as if there would be more transparent glass. I would like to explore the first minutes of the Alls, but we will never see it, since the urine is covered through its own descendant."</seg>
<seg id="541">"using Gravitational waves, it should be possible to back up until the beginning."</seg>
<seg id="542">"and most importantly: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen we will never see, which we will never see, and of which we have no idea of what we just discover when we listen."</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, LIGO took place in the first kick-out things that we did not expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says to this subject: ME: the type of stars, the black holes emerged as LIGO they are observed, are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"they are enormous, ancient body of prehistoric times. the black holes are sounded the suction nochen for our archeological work."</seg>
<seg id="546">"LIGO enables us to completely different angles on the events in the universe, to the emergence of the stars and ultimately on how we emanate from this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is now to be as bold as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to LIGO we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and circles of cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a brand new generation of observatories on Earth and in the All.</seg>

<seg id="560">"no, but yes!"</seg>
<seg id="561">Wanted to start with the showroom?</seg>
<seg id="562">"no, no, no, but yes, yes, yes."</seg>
<seg id="563">"and a crazy thing happened: exactly what to do, wovor I feared, was my fear."</seg>
<seg id="564">"my fear, speeches to hold, my social fear -- Puff, gone."</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"" "yes, my life changed."</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes," changed me. "</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain yes that changed my life on an unexpected. it started with a question of my youngest.</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, called for unexplainable reasons all" ""</seg>
<seg id="570">As if they were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"kittens, I need milk for my beak."</seg>
<seg id="572">"she asked me once I could play with her, when I was just on the go. and I said," yes. "</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"of a new way of life in my family. from there to fluctuate me, always with them to play, as soon as you go to it. no matter what I'm going to do, or where I go, I say always Yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">"almost. I am not perfect, but I paint myself very much."</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, to my children, to our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">"but it also has an intriguing side effect: just before short, I actually stood out that the" Yes "-Searing for playing with my children my career saved."</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am author. I think of things that awakens you to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I Create television. I produciere television.</seg>
<seg id="585">"I make television, in a great style."</seg>
<seg id="586">"in this TV season, I am responsible for doing 70 hours of program to the world."</seg>
<seg id="587">"four television programs, 70 hours TV. three to four shows are simultaneously in production."</seg>
<seg id="588">"each shipment has hundreds of jobs, which previously existed before."</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV set may lie between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"a new episode all nine days of four shows, i.e. all nine days 20 million dollars television, four television programs, three hours TV, three episodes, 21 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours of television,"</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV shows are running on Thursday morning.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world run my series in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spectators.</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of this 70 TV-hours are shipments that I have created itself, and not only produced, so still obelessly, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four television series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfire, all around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is still doing?</seg>
<seg id="598">"nobody, that's why am I a Titan."</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I do not want to impress with it.</seg>
<seg id="601">"I say it, because I know what you think if the word" author "falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">"I say to you, so that all of you who work so hard if you work out a company, a country or a budget to take a business or a household, so that I am saying: I understand that I don't understand it, I understand that there is not just a dream job to dream."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it is all a job, all work, all the reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I'm working much, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"when I am deepened into the work, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work creates always a land from nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">"it is, when I set troops on, when malt I on a canvas."</seg>
<seg id="608">"as a result, you have a high tone, ripe a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all this at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">"it is creative, mechanically, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and destructive, cruel and reasonable. and the best thing about it is the sums."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when working well runs.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a sums begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the sums hear like a busy road, I could always drive on her."</seg>
<seg id="615">"many people take, when I talk to them the sums that I overs writing, that writing me joy."</seg>
<seg id="616">Do not understand me wrong that does it.</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the sums up -- when I began working and work with television production, when I began working and work and work together, I discovered this thing, this swam, this energy. the sums!"</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The totals is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The totals is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The totals is the voice of God in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a totals, then you can not stand differently from size."</seg>
<seg id="623">"feeling that can not be different than to strive for size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it also means a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is the ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I just know that I am not made for failure, and I just know that I love the buzz."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I will only say to you, I am a Titan, and I know that I will not ask it."</seg>
<seg id="632">"to make a clear one: the more successful I will, the more episodes, the more energetic boons, the more work there are, the more things at the same time, the more I write history, the more expectations I have history, the more expectations there are."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to be successful, the more you need to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what does I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love work, not true?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the land, which I create, the marathon that I go, the army, the high tone, the sums, the sums, the sums."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this summs. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the summs.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this summs?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then stops the sums.</seg>
<seg id="641">"revised, overlap, hidden."</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stops.</seg>
<seg id="643">"now, my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that her mother is a single working class."</seg>
<seg id="644">"Harper tells people:" my mom will not be there, but you can write my Nanny. "</seg>
<seg id="645">"and Emerson says:" "bad, I want to go to Shonda-land."</seg>
<seg id="646">There are the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">You are Baby-Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1, when the totals heard."</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine walled.</seg>
<seg id="650">I did not loved my work anymore. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My totals was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I made the same things as always: the same title-work, 15 hours days, passed, no repentance, no repentance, a Titan sleeps not, is not on, with all the heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">"I was a lecture,"</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was gray, I just had no fun more."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the summs and the sums I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what makes you do if what you do, the work you love, suddenly faded?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know, some may think:" "Heul thee out, with the author-titanium."</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know you doing it, you are doing, you love to be a teacher to be a painter, a painter, Bill Gates, one loves to know one another and that gives one the sums you knew when the sums have stops, when the sums stops, who is you then?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"when the song of my heart listens, can I survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern states-Kellnerin" a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I am on the way to the outside, late in and she says:" "Mama, do you be playing?"</seg>
<seg id="673">"and I already will say No, when I will be conscious of two things:"</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I have to say yes to everything and secondly, she called me not."</seg>
<seg id="675">"they do not call any more" "kittens". ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happened?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I verb it, when I am Titan and my swam praying, and here everything is changing my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says:" "Mama, do you be playing?"</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="680">This is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and her sisters come up, we laugh much and I read quite dramatically from the book" "Everybody Poops". ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in the loneliness and in the absence of the Summens, I cannot do anything except."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focussed.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the land, which I create, the marathon that I walk, the army, the canvas, the high tone - they no longer exist."</seg>
<seg id="687">"all that exists are glued finger and humid kisses, delicate voices, vigilly stipens and the song, in which there is Losing, or whatever the girl in" The Ice Royal Queen. "</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air at this place is so short that I can barely breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe me.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me triggers itself.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes on and an energy club comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and that is not immediately, but it happened."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums slowly come back.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, hardly there, it is silently, hardly audible, but it is there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the sums, but a sums."</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel when I would know a magic secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let us remain in the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. this is all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. just love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the totals, the working environment, the Titanium housing, which is only the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who are you are when I say to you, who I am, when I am writing by broadcasts and television hours, and how functioning my brain, then I have forgotten what is real sums."</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums is not power and it is not working specifically.</seg>
<seg id="708">It is dependent on the pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sums is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The totals is the flow that comes from the lifelong.</seg>
<seg id="711">True sums is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"real sums ignores the pressure of the story, which to erleting tasks, the expectation and the pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"the real sums is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps flee to me God the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a Titan?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a bit more love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"once my child wants to play with me, I will say Yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">I rule this for a fixed rule so I can rid myself as a workaholic of any debt.</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is law, I have no other choice. I have no other choice, if I want to hear the sums again."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be so simple. I am not good in playing, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">Play is not enough for me how to work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth is hurting;</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">"I always work, because I love it."</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer working at the workplace as daheim.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this concession is painful, because what a person is working rather than to be home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well, I."</seg>
<seg id="728">"I honestly, I call me" "Titan" "--"</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">"that I am to relaxed, is none of them."</seg>
<seg id="731">"we rasen in the garden around, before and back, and forth."</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties;</seg>
<seg id="733">We are singing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We cerating soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">"here I feel overwhelmed by mostly rigid, absent and baffled."</seg>
<seg id="736">I always have traveled to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how you live, and the sums of the universe fills me."</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why did we ever hear about playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! let them always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you hold me for naive for a daydreams.</seg>
<seg id="742">"you probably have right, but you can do it also!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? you are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">"my kids want to play at most 15 minutes with me, until they plain, that they would like to make something different."</seg>
<seg id="748">"it is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes I replaced a Marienkäfer or Keks.</seg>
<seg id="750">"and my teen-daughter whole 15 minutes long with me, I am mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"there are only 15 minutes, more it does not require."</seg>
<seg id="752">Everybody can bring 15 minutes to the piece yourself in a bad mood day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes at the piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no cell, no laundry, no distraction."</seg>
<seg id="755">"the day is short: dinner, the children of praying."</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are drilled!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my Well-being, my world. it is not to be the children. it is to feel the summs to have a place for his soul frighty."</seg>
<seg id="758">It is not about playing with your own children. it is about joy;</seg>
<seg id="759">To play the "Play" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself in the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do good.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and keep it out.</seg>
<seg id="763">"I am not perfect in it. I fail and I siege. friends, reading books, read the day --"</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" is short for everything I have given, when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in education, when I wanted to meet even more and more. "</seg>
<seg id="765">"15 minutes at the piece, why not go full 15 minutes"</seg>
<seg id="766">What can I be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums came back in my spare time. the totals seems to return if I do not work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months opens a door, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul. I lost myself to new ideas. I nutze it into full and love my work again."</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the sums but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I do not need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the swam; the sums it is not me... not anymore.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky finger, dinner with friends. "</seg>
<seg id="774">This is now my swamp.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">"the totals of work is part of me, but just a part. and so I am so grateful."</seg>
<seg id="778">"it is me snow, that I am a Titan. I have never seen a Titan, the journey to Jerusalem."</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and to play more.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is even functioning. my campfire still burn.</seg>
<seg id="781">"the more I play, the more happier I and my children."</seg>
<seg id="782">"the more I play, the more I feel as a good mother."</seg>
<seg id="783">"the more I play, the more clearly my head is."</seg>
<seg id="784">"the more I play, the better I work."</seg>
<seg id="785">"the more I play, the more I listen to the summs. the land, which I am fries, the marathon that I go, the vases, the high tone, the sums, the sums, the sums of life: the sums of life."</seg>
<seg id="786">"the more I feel this totals, the more this more unusual, blowing, naked and new feeling of life in me wide. less Titan -- more I!"</seg>
<seg id="787">"the more I feel exactly this totals, the more I know who I am."</seg>
<seg id="788">I am author. I think of things I awake to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">"this belongs to the job, which means to live its dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">"this is the dream of that job,"</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dream job should be a little träumerous.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said "Yes" to less work and to play more.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titles have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thanks beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am Neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="797">As most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after a serious stroke or after an automobile accident."</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurochirurgen it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other bodily organs, has a very low capacity for self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a severe injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, heavy disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">That is probably the reason why I was functional Neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the neuronal functions through various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">"certainly they have heard of one of the most prominent, the" Tiefenhirnstimulation "." it implanted an electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neurons so that neurological function has been improved. "</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. she has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson who suffered from severe tremors and heavy pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">"however, neuromodulation does not mean Neuro healing."</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeon is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I want to show you that we are very close to you.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was leading thatine and worked day and night in the emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I used patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">"you need to imagine that at skull-brain-traumas, the brain increases and the cranial pressure increases."</seg>
<seg id="815">"to save life, you have to diminish the cranial pressure."</seg>
<seg id="816">But sometimes you have to remove a part of a swollen brain.</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing the swollen brain's mass, we decided to analyse with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"to let cells of a tissue piece grow, it is comparable to small children who are taken out of your families."</seg>
<seg id="822">"you have to find the proper diet, temperature, moisture and the environments to let them thrive."</seg>
<seg id="823">This is what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many trials it was Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw in his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">This was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells, which are surrounded by small, unmature cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from the biologians that stem cells unripe cells can turn into every cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small nical of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to get this kind of stem cells from the surface of the brain material in the OP.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made a further fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells resumes differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They were slowly and after a couple of weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, weird cell population, which saw as stem cells, but it was different."</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand how they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are hot Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our magnification cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">At the stage of the fetus they ensure the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay with us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, since we find them in higher concentrations close to brain violations."</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not as safe.</seg>
<seg id="848">But one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand in front of a potential cell source that allows brain.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove it.</seg>
<seg id="851">"so, we decided to develop an experiment."</seg>
<seg id="852">"we wanted a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic areas, and then the cells were just as cultivating as Jean-François did."</seg>
<seg id="853">And they subsequently mark the colour in order to pursue them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we implanted it at the release of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologist transcending transplant -- Autotrantransplant.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we implant these cells in normal hierarchy tissue? and what will happen if we implant the same cells in denial brain tissues?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario we implanted the cells in a healthy brain, and we observed that she had been completely disappeared after a few weeks, they would go back home. the room is already occupied, they are not needed, so they disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">"in the second scenario we added a injury to and implanted exactly the same cells, and now the cells remained -- they knew neurons to mature neurons."</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you can see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been implanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">"the evidence that they demonstrate are these small points. these are the cells, which we were vitro in vitro."</seg>
<seg id="863">Here we could not stop.</seg>
<seg id="864">Can these cells also help a monkeys to recover from a brain's infringement?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we exercise monkeys with a manual reaction task.</seg>
<seg id="866">You had to take food pellets from a tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made them very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">"when they had reached a stable skill level, we have achieved the hand in the motor Cortex motor field."</seg>
<seg id="869">"then the monkeys were paralysed, they could no longer move their hands anymore."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it would happen with people, they lost spontaneously up to some degree, just like after one stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">"the patients are paralyzed and then they try to relax with the help of sculptural Brain mechanisms. you can relax at some extent, just like the monkey."</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted its own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">"on the left you see the monkey, which spontaneously recovered."</seg>
<seg id="874">It can take about 40% to 50% of its original performance from violation.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not as precise and not as fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now, see when we implanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the Reimplantation."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and later use.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use them in other neuropathological models, for example with Parkinson."</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implant her in people.</seg>
<seg id="882">"I really hope, that I can show you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal yourself."</seg>
<seg id="883">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is wonderful, I am sure that right now, several dozen people in the audience, perhaps even the majority, think:" I know someone who need that. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you start clinical trials in the human being."</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the greatest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this kind of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable; the brain is very delicate and so.</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">"BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get the permission to start the clinical studies. if you continue in the future, how many years it will take, until someone can come to hospital and this therapy will be available."</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: this is difficult to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then we must perform this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">"it takes time for a long time to select patients, perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to do this kind of treatment."</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply this to a multicentric study.</seg>
<seg id="897">You first have to really prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne thanks for your visit to TED and that you told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a great mistake to consider it as natural.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we do not see democracy as the fragile plant that it is in reality, but as inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to look at it as an immutable reality.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism is inevitably led to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">"Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great neighbor in Beijing have clearly demonstrated that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth while politics is completely undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy comes with us in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year, when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unambiguous that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- not affect the austerity programs that have been realised in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at this moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my incubous friends who would repeat to me, if they would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for genuine democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you, together with me to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of an error, we could save the democracy but that we need a true and defective democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"for without democracy our societies are mailed, our future düster and our great, new technologies."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the subject of waste, I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction, the currently our tavern is threatened."</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "Gemini-Detox-Paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">"a summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the school-mountain, who throws its long shadow over the U.S., Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all know the debtor,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But only a few recognize its Gemini.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash, which belongs to the twisting asparagus and corporations, which could be too scared there, where it would be productive and incomes with whom you could produce the debt mountain, and even all the things you need to urgently needed for example" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"in the past 3 months, in the US, in England and the euro area, 3.4 Billionen invested US dollars, such as industrial sectors, machines, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment, and so on and so on."</seg>
<seg id="922">"3.4 Billionen's US dollars also sounds a lot of money until one compares it with the 5,1 trillion US dollars, which at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing, except the stock exchange and for the property prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"so debt and unproductive capital make the twins, which is not the same by the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the outcome are stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the U.S., Japan and Europe, and consequently, a low level of economic demand that could not invest in which they would not invest. just like Ödipus father, who from fear, the prophecy of the oracle could be true that his son would kill him when he grows,"</seg>
<seg id="925">The circumstances leading the circumstances that Ödipus lead him kills.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hairs with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"his extremely caring art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, to further develop human talents, and especially to finance the technologies," green "technologies, which are critical for the salvation of the earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">So Democracy is the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I believe. but before we proceed: what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as the social form in which the Free and the poor as a majority control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The athenian democracy will of course end up too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be a mistake to minate the significance of athenic democracy due to these closures."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decision for the athenian democracy was and is that they had the working poor in freedom of expression, and not only the right to freedom of expression, but more important and crucial that they gave them the right to political co-determination with the same singular weighting in questions of the prosecutor."</seg>
<seg id="935">The athenian democracy has not been kept too long --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle, which is very bright, it is also rapidly spread."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our today's liberal democracies have no roots in ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious Revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the athenian democracy focused on the free citizens and the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which was ultimately a statute for the ruling class."</seg>
<seg id="940">"the liberal democracy came only upon, as a complete separation of politics and economy is possible and the democratic process was established in politics during the economy -- so the world of corporations -- a democracy-free zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in our present democracies since the time, in which this separation of politics and economy began, an intolerance struggle between the two instead of taking the economy gradually descends."</seg>
<seg id="942">Are you wondering why the politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not at a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is because that one cannot be in the government today, and still not in power because the power of politics is vandered into the economy and are separated."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my haste with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"when you think about it, it is in about such as a herd of smoke, which is thus sustainably the animals, of which they nourishes, decimal by the end therefore."</seg>
<seg id="947">"similarly, it is with the economy that has declared politics so far as far as the self-caused economic crisis itself. the power of corporations grows, political goods will be ascertained to reduce inequality, the overall economic demand and the managing director of the corporations are too scented to invest the cash of their business."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the successful of capitalism the" Demos "[the people] from democracy, the higher the twins, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the welfare of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if that's true, it is obvious that we need the politics and the economy again, and it would be better if the" Demos "" retains to control such as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners. "</seg>
<seg id="950">"by the way, this is not a new idea."</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist Left had already had this idea about 100 years ago and it was not very quirky good.</seg>
<seg id="952">"the doctrine of the debacle of the Soviet Union should be, that the working poor can only be regained by a miracle like in ancient Athens without new species of brutality and waste."</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism is doing it by replacing low-time employees by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is, so long economy and politics are separate areas, the automating the twins, and social conflicts are deeper, just as it is very soon as I think -- in countries like China will come."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so we must reunite the economy and reunite the areas of business and politics, and thereby consider that we will appear again in a pathological surveillance hyperautocracy that appear the film" Matrix "as a documentation."</seg>
<seg id="957">"so the question is not whether capitalism has brought the technical achievements, which he has brought forth."</seg>
<seg id="958">"the more interesting question is whether capitalism is dissolved by a Dystroscopy, similar to that in" "star Trek", "or through something that put the society in" "Star Trek", "in the machinery of the universe, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athener" Agora, "in long talks to the meaning of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">"I think, we may be optimistic."</seg>
<seg id="960">"so what did it look, how could it look like this" "Star Trek" "like utopia instead of the" "matrix" "similar Dystscopy?"</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation I would like to give you, in all short, some examples call."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the field of companies: please make a capital market prior to which you deserve money, while you work and in which your capital follows you from a working place to next, from a company to the next, and the company -- no matter which one is currently working -- is the property of those who currently work in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">"then, all income from capital and dissolve and the concept of wage labor is completely outdated."</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction between those who belong to the enterprises, but do not work in it, and employees working there that the company does not belong. no doves more between capital and labour, no major gaps between investment and coars, and ultimately no ascending constraints."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the field of global political economy, please imagine that our national currencies would have a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, presented by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging countries], is represented in the interest of the whole of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="966">"furthermore, imagine that the whole world trading in this currency will be traded -- we call it" "Cosmos", "in units of" Cosmos "" -- and every government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the merchant of the respective country into a common fund. "</seg>
<seg id="967">"also present that this fund is investing in" green "technologies, especially in parts of the world, in which investment means."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time there was not the technical means to put it into practice.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today, we have seen it, particularly ahead of the background of a reunified policy and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world that I describe you is simultaneously liberal, in which they preferred to have privileged people, and Marxist, because they buried the separation of capital and work in the trash of history, and keynesians, globally keynesian."</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all others it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we dispose into a "matrix" - similar deystroscopy?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we work together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">"it is in our hands, and we do it better democratic."</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You write yourself in your biography itself as a libertarian Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">"Yanis Varoufakis: if anything of what I have just said, then Marx is relevant."</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for reunification of politics and economy is... do not work that the technological development will generate such massive decrease in the overall economic demand, which is Larry Summers as" long term stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"through the transmission of this crisis from one portion of the earth to the next, as we're currently experiencing it, it will not only be our democracies destabilise but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is correct, then Marx is quite relevant."</seg>
<seg id="986">"likewise, as Hayek, that's why I am a libertarian Marxist, and like Keynes, and that's why I am also fully equipped."</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually and now we are well.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if one is not wirr you do not think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">"BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein that said. BG: in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner the Redner, you made very clear what you think of the view of the West in China."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the semblance of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my talk, we have limited democracy to politics during the area where most of the economy -- is a completely democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in some respects, if I may say that provocative must say that China today resembles the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">"-- remember -- we tend to combine liberalism with democracy -- this is a mistake, historically considered."</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, as John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical that concerns the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">"what you can watch in China now, resembles very much the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"to do this, China is now doing what the West has done itself in the 19th century, smells even to hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners curious to your experiences as a finance minister in the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I know that that comes.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How did you look back to the first half of six months?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the eurozone."</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"namely, from self-sufficiency to say, and the continuance denial that a massive verfuse by the eurozone ran, and continues to be massively threatened by the development of the whole European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- the way, the first proposal was, who revealed this denial --"</seg>
<seg id="1008">"it is right to do. unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone is elected within the European group, continue to deny the denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">"but you know, what is coming."</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if one tries to obtain a economic system that is not viable, by political will and authoritarianism in life, it will be hesitant perhaps if the change occurs, it happens abrupt and destructive."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what change do you see ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future when we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: do you have any errors in your time as finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who look back -- seriously...</seg>
<seg id="1017">"if there is a finance minister, or any minister, who claims after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, he did not have mistakes, then that is a dangerous person."</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest bug was to undersigned the request for the extension of the debt program end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">"I believed that there was an honest interest on the sides of the donors, to find a common solution."</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not there.</seg>
<seg id="1022">"they merely wanted to bring our government only because they didn't want to deal with the objections, which were running through the eurozone."</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to admit that they have been catastrophic in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominated GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">There is worse than during the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">"none from the troika of the donors, who raised us this policy:" this was a colossal mistake. "</seg>
<seg id="1027">"BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive day of talks, you seem to be right pro-European."</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is facing someone, the Europe lives and loves."</seg>
<seg id="1030">My greatest fear is that the eurozone is not survived.</seg>
<seg id="1031">"for if they are not survived, the released tile-forces will be demonic and destroy the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1032">"this will not be catastrophic consequences, but for the global economy."</seg>

<seg id="1037">YV: thanks.</seg>
<seg id="1038">"by Roy Price most of them have never heard, although he probably is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to deciding which I met for three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is conductance at Amazon Studios;</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV-production company of Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slim, has a yellow-term and describes himself on Twitter as" films, TV, technology, Tacos. "</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for providing the shows and content to produce the Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very hard fighting industry."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy cannot select any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he must find shows that are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he has to find shows that are right on the right side."</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the measurement distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating will show up from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review received.</seg>
<seg id="1050">"your show will be rated with nine and higher, this is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these are shows like" Breaking Bad "," "Game of Thrones", "The Wire" -- all the shows, the addictive, where you ask a season, your brain asks, "" where is there any more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left side, here at this end, shows how" "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- that should tell you enough what goes to that end of the curve. "</seg>
<seg id="1055">"Roy Price does not worry about the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to provide" toddlers and Tiaras "." "</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he makes more thoughts about the average endurance, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply won't."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the pressure is available, and of course it is also the first time at Amazon as something makes, therefore I want to risk nothing at nothing."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants success created.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he needs guarantee success, so he holds a contest."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes many ideas for TV Shows and choose from an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode each of these shows and puts it online, where they can watch everyone free of charge."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon does not find stuff out there, you can still find it right?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers look at this episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are observed by Roy and his team who take everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you can capture when you start the show, when one pays off, which parts you jump or check again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">"they collect millions of data to decide with these data, which show them should produce."</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they collect the data, process these and resulting from the answer, and this is:" Amazon should make a Sitcom over four republicans US senators. "</seg>
<seg id="1069">They did this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does someone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"Alpha House," but Alpha House, "but it seems that not many of this show may remember, because they were not so good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it is only an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve 7,4 is and Alpha House, at 7.5 -- so something above average, but not exactly what they worked on Roy and his team."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"about at the same time when another company has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking for this a super-show and he also uses data to do, but he does something different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of holding a contest, he and his team looked at the existing data about the Netflix spectators, so the reviews that they give the shows, whose shows they like etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then use these data to find these small details about the spectators: what shows they like, which producers, which actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all the parts together, they entered a wagon and decided not to make a sitcom about four senators, but a drama series about a senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," House of Cards ". Netflix has a hit, at least for the first two seasons."</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9,1 review on this curve. therefore, exactly where they wanted to. "</seg>
<seg id="1080">"of course, the question is what happened here?"</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competitive data sealed companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data and it works great for one of them but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is that?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow defeated that this should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"when one collects millions of data, for a decision that one meets, then one should meet a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">It has 200 years to statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized with very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"the minus, what you can expect is good TV, or?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"when data analysis is so not working, then this is a terrifying because we live in a time when we take more and more statistics to take serious decisions, far beyond TV."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Knows someone here the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"nobody. OK, that is even good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one can ever come in touch with this software. come in touch with this software you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if anyone is in prison in the US and around dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge is done or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just like at Amazon and Netflix. but instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad, it will be a person good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"moderate television, 22 minutes, this can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that these data analysis, despite of the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">"this is not always the best results, this is not that a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data."</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data can also be sealed is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google does sometimes make mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"in 2009, Google announced that they are able to tell by data analysis of flu, the limlimmen's way to pretensions -- by data analysis of the Google research."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderful and was a great news release. the success detox in a release in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked flawless, year round by year until it suddenly no longer worked,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it simply didn't work, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the magazine" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data detest companies like Amazon and Google abouts sometimes something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"despite all of these mistakes, data flows into decisions of life -- at the workplace, in case of loss, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">"I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-assisted genetics -- an area where some very smart people unimaginable many data to make serious decisions, such as the decision for a cancer therapy"</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I have recognized some samples over the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be distributed.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"you have to solve a complex problem, just do two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"as a First erect this problem in its parts, so that you can analyze the parts; as a second one set the parts again to put a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you need to do this several times, but there are always two things: apart and put together again."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerfully, can only help create a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to make the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">"for this, there is another tool and we all possess all: our brain."</seg>
<seg id="1117">"if there is something in which the brain is good, it is parts and pieces come back together, even if the information is incomplete to take a good release -- especially when it is the brain's brain."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"that is why I believe, Netflix was so successful because they have data and mind, where they also went into the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use the data to better understand their audience, what else does not have been able to understand them. but the decision, how to take all these parts, and make it a show such as" House of Cards "," that was not in the data. "</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show which meant that they entered a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">"in contrast, Amazon did this in the wrong way."</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used to control all their decisions, first than they selected for TV ideas, then as they chose" Alpha House "as a show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision because they could always say: "they say to us the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data is helpful for better decisions, but I believe that things go wrong, when data begin to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerfully they are, data are just a tool, and to not forget it, this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before there was data, this was the device for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"it is also called" "Magic 8 Ball". "it is amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or no matter you only need to shake the ball to get an answer." most likely "-- exactly here in this moment."</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will return it later with a technique of technology.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"so far, I have made some decisions in my life so far, whereby I should have heard in retrospect on the ball."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"however, as you of course know if you have the data available, you would like to replace these through something much more clashes, such as data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic building.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"perhaps the ball cleverer and wiser and wiser. ultimately, it lies on us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as very encouraging message, that despite the large amount of data still pays off to make decisions, an expert in what you do is doing and risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"in the end it is not the data, but the risks associated with which you land at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thanks beautiful.</seg>
