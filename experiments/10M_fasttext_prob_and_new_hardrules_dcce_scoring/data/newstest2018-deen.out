Munich 1856 : four cards that change your view of the city
a Ir@@ ren @-@ institution where people will encounter young people today .
a tomb which is now founded for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ ers manage the un@@ favorable reason of farmers .
the oldest official map Mün@@ te promotes exciting stories about days .
it &apos;s more nervous when the cards are not up to date .
&quot; that knows everyone who had already had to rain from time , because the Auto @-@ Nav@@ i showed instead of a h@@ ew@@ ing road a green meadow . &quot;
&quot; the historical map of the digital Bayern @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bavaria of the State government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - yet , it is very popular . &quot;
especially when you compare them with current online cards .
&quot; then , the towns and municipalities in the spread @-@ area of the Mün@@ ch@@ ner Merk@@ ur changed since the 19th century . &quot;
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a Flick@@ est@@ epp@@ i that is not recogni@@ zes as such .
&quot; in the large overview map , for towns and municipalities are detailed maps , so @-@ called jud@@ gement leaves . &quot;
these were created according to statements of the Bay@@ erische Ver@@ Meas@@ u@@ management between 18@@ 10 and 1864 and escap@@ ed the first verse .
your client : Napoleon .
the French He@@ er@@ es@@ leader engaged in Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second coalition agreement with Austria .
Napoleon sees a survey of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic record of Bavaria &apos;s mission - of course for military purposes .
&quot; even if the French troops took place with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from 9 February 18@@ 01 , there were today &apos;s neigh@@ bor that Cre@@ ate the idea of an area @-@ covered Bavaria map . &quot;
&quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max I@@ V. Joseph drove the project forward , founded the &quot; top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bay@@ erische Ver@@ measurable administration . &quot;
the certificate for Munich comes from 1856 and is like to find all others on the Bav@@ arian National Library .
the comparison of Fruit / Today is an example of the provincial capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is sub@@ s@@ end@@ ling that appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856 .
&quot; S@@ end@@ ling was taken 21 years after the map , i.e. 1877 , as Mün@@ ch@@ ner district . &quot;
&quot; today , sub@@ s@@ end@@ ling lies in the middle of the city . &quot;
&quot; the houses sub@@ s@@ end@@ ings concentrate around 1856 along the present Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ strasse , which was named in 1878 after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the insurrection of the Bav@@ arian farmer against Austria 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : at the top glance , a smaller map with do@@ z@@ ens lines and numbers : hand@@ writing numbered Fl@@ ur@@ pieces from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; urine &quot; &quot; from which the basic tax was derived . &quot;
&quot; today , small plots arose today no farmers more - but small gar@@ den@@ er of the plant &quot; &quot; land in the sun . &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ s@@ end@@ ling .
&quot; the Ther@@ es@@ ien@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 Schau@@ court of the October Revolution , was in the 19th century still a meadow - and no concrete desert . &quot;
on the other side of the Is@@ ar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; in the jungle of the present district A@@ u @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , not only reads the street names &quot; &quot; at Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; or from the &quot; &quot; On the ventilation &quot; &quot; - but also in a great letter &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ stalt &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ fel@@ dre@@ straße , one once used people with mad@@ ness . &quot;
there was 18@@ 58 / 59 the Mün@@ ch@@ ner Circle @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; On the Au@@ er Ventil@@ ation .
&quot; from 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden the institution - that psych@@ i@@ ater which is associated with the death of King Ludwi@@ gs II . &quot;
&quot; he was advanced for his time and ended for example the acquis@@ itions of so @-@ called Ir@@ ren .
&quot; he is also prohibited to use the staff to apply force against the occup@@ ants , says Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has worked for an exhibition with the institution . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients there was first place , later was extended to 500 places . &quot;
&quot; at some point , this capacity was no longer - the reason for the construction of the roundabout into hair 1905 . &quot;
&quot; since 2006 Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost , one of the largest psychiat@@ rists in Germany . &quot;
on the A@@ real of the former Au@@ er An@@ stalt it meet young people in Mün@@ ch@@ ner Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um .
&quot; the Order er@@ war@@ b the building complex 1920 , and turned him into a youth with training . &quot;
&quot; west lies the football field of the TS@@ V Munich East , east of residential buildings from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the children of &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bosco &quot; &quot; - in architectural bonds to the origin of Iraq &apos;s origin , was destroyed during World War II with bom@@ bing ra@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; the Marien@@ platz was around 1856 as a &quot; main square &quot; , &quot; the Kauf@@ mann Road was called &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ mann G@@ asse &quot; . &quot; &quot;
a decisive change in the Second World War in the heart of Mün@@ te .
the bom@@ bs of the Al@@ lies were in December 1944 many holes in the city center .
a big stayed until today - At the Marien@@ hof .
&quot; the German Institute , small business houses and a tomb of Middle Ages stood once the Marien@@ hof , where these days take place on the court and take place on 5 April 2017 , the Ground @-@ Bahn for the second S @-@ Bahn . &quot;
&quot; with the sli@@ der , the old Munich @-@ map can be compared with the a@@ erial photograph of today and fill up the hole at the Marien@@ hof . &quot;
civil law @-@ group published e@@ ew@@ ar@@ ming for Miss@@ our@@ i
the nation@@ ale Association for the Promotion of colour@@ less has issued a warning for colored people who travel to Miss@@ our@@ i due to discrimin@@ atory policies and the rac@@ ist attacks of the state .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the federal state of Miss@@ our@@ i , which shall take into force until 28 August 2017 , calls for A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sou@@ ri@@ ans , as a number of ques@@ tion@@ able , r@@ ams based deposits , lately occurred in recent times throughout the state and here , it is stated in the opinion of the group . &quot;
&quot; a recently adopted law of Miss@@ our@@ i , which makes it more difficult to gain dis@@ crimin@@ ation , as well as the prosec@@ ution authorities of the State , the dis@@ proportion@@ ate to minorities , the NA@@ AC@@ P said , said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot;
&quot; they have violations of civil rights , people happen . &quot;
&quot; they are hal@@ ted because of their skin colour , they will be be@@ aten or killed , &quot; said the president of the Miss@@ our@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , Ro@@ d Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot;
&quot; we hear discomfort in such a frequency , which we have not yet heard . &quot;
it is the first such a warning that has issued the organization for a state in the US .
&quot; the group mis@@ led inci@@ dents like rac@@ ist off@@ ences against black students at the University of Miss@@ our@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from T@@ ennes@@ see . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died at the beginning of the year , after having had no gas@@ oline during the journey through the state and was taken by the police of Miss@@ our@@ i in awareness , without a crime . &quot;
the Council also points to a recent report by the Office of the General State Department of Miss@@ our@@ i in which it is shown that black drivers in the state 75 percent will be more common than past@@ ures .
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware of people and their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Miss@@ our@@ i , &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot;
people need to be ready whether there are Kau@@ p@@ entry or let the relatives know that they travel through the state .
&quot; Miss@@ our@@ i directories , in 2015 100 Hass@@ ver@@ i , after the latest numbers from the Hass@@ ver@@ bre@@ d correction program of the F@@ BI , which reached the state with respect to the number of such violations by the 16th rank of the country . &quot;
the far@@ ewell is also an answer to a new mis@@ our@@ i law that would make it more difficult to complain a company because of living and employment discrimination .
&quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union had issued voy@@ ages for Texas and Arizona , after the States immigration authorities had to commit those local prosec@@ ution authorities to commit people because of immigration violations . &quot;
&quot; travel arrangements are usually issued by the Foreign Ministry for other countries , but last time , interested parties involved the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
ordination of Wei@@ de@@ za@@ un@@ project is spontaneous
the her@@ edit@@ ary past@@ ure project is a success project and is continued in the coming year .
the CD@@ U @-@ Bundestag Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ovac have shown himself a picture on the ground .
&quot; at the rec@@ tan@@ gible of the Schwen@@ dem@@ ann family , representatives of the Fis@@ her@@ acher CD@@ U @-@ local association met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members . &quot;
&quot; Markus Schwen@@ dem@@ ann granted initially insights into its operations , in which he enjoys 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and also served in five apartments holiday guests . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ al@@ d@@ mil@@ ch &quot; &quot; is for him the altern@@ ate mark@@ eter away for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ dem@@ ann . &quot;
on the table of the holiday guests only comes region@@ ales .
&quot; since he is also a B@@ L@@ HV @-@ president of Fishing bach , he called the Wei@@ de@@ za@@ un@@ project as &quot; spontaneous &quot; . &quot; &quot;
I cannot be able to profit in such a steep areas .
&quot; the green space for a lot of work , many m@@ ts with the motor sense are processed . &quot;
&quot; we have here to fight with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; emphas@@ ised swi@@ dem@@ ann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 he assumed the el@@ ter@@ ous operation and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertilizers , even if he is not a bio@@ operation . &quot;
&quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; the Commun@@ e recognised the meaning of the past@@ ure project and is glad to support the leader . &quot;
&quot; at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hect@@ are , farmers would have to be supported . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we hope that the fo@@ rest@@ ation of the areas could be moved out for quite a while . &quot;
&quot; the greatest treasure that we have , are the people who work in agriculture and worry about how they continue their operation , &quot; says the may@@ or . &quot;
farmers are often standing in criticism because of their support
over the Wei@@ de@@ za@@ unlimited promotion were fenced in 2013 a total of 25 plots of eleven participants .
&quot; the disclosure surface amounts to 40 hectares , which can not be en@@ for@@ ged until at least 2023 . &quot;
&quot; of the total cost of 71 500 Euro the half was funded by the Leader , a quarter carried out the community fishing bach . &quot;
&quot; thus , the farmers have to invest 12 610 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres of past@@ ure fence . &quot;
&quot; the big advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Schwen@@ dem@@ ann . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ovac stressed : &quot; &quot; you do a really good job , without farmers and land . &quot;
even for Peter Weiss stood firm : &quot; here are the best food produced . &quot;
the Agricultural Policy ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows the state promotion of women @-@ tough .
the goal is the disclosure of the Schwar@@ zw@@ al@@ ds .
the presence of one of the L@@ PR marked convey@@ ors is the presence of one of the L@@ PR .
&quot; in addition , the inter@@ mitt@@ ent surface may not be applied ( Hang@@ slope above 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened with fo@@ rest@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; for the her@@ edit@@ ary Wei@@ de@@ za@@ mis@@ project 2018 , the application of eight participants currently runs with 24 plots , which would like to build up close to 16 kilometers fence . &quot;
&quot; the disclosure surface corresponds to 35 hectares , the cold costs are more than 112 000 Euro . &quot;
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tru@@ mp is taking the Statue of Liberty
the safest sign of a regime change is it when they begin to att@@ acking the statues .
the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the corrupt overthrow of Saddam H@@ uss@@ ein at the Fir@@ dos Square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Mill@@ er , one of the key @-@ ide@@ olo@@ gues of the Tru@@ mp regime , knew what he did when he took a symbolic Ax@@ t in a h@@ it@@ ful battle with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CN@@ N on the proposals of the President to the dr@@ as@@ tical restriction of legal migration with the statue of Liberty .
&quot; to stay fair , Mill@@ er did not handle the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of jet@@ ties and Liberty Shi@@ it@@ ators would have earned him when he had done it .
&quot; but he laid their significance , and in particular the meaning that you were written , when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , his base was added . &quot;
&quot; as Mill@@ er A@@ co@@ sta , I want to go here not to a complete thing about history , but the statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world . &quot;
the poem to which you can refer to which later was added and not part of the original statue of Liberty .
&quot; Mill@@ er is knowled@@ geable right , but as he did it ourselves , it is not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary response to the asc@@ ending words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants , but the poorest people of the poor : &quot; &quot; your hum@@ ble , your poor , / thy heart@@ ed masses , who like to breathe free , / the el@@ end waste of your rich co@@ asts . &quot;
there has never been a time in which the &quot; el@@ ap@@ ing waste &quot; was better to see on our screens .
Mill@@ er had not engaged in liter@@ ary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Tru@@ mp@@ s USA .
this conflict due to the meaning of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural conflict : it is indeed a conflict in the meaning of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who sat down to place their words after her death at the base - did very well that they have accomplished a highly political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and american rep@@ ublic@@ anism by presenting the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of the freedom .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem is the feminine character not more abstract - it has received a voice .
and she himself gives himself a very different name : mother of the Ex@@ il@@ ants .
the connection of the poem is a brilliant femin@@ ist cou@@ p and a devast@@ ating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and just like Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , the people wanted to change it for a long time from the right wing . &quot;
&quot; the big scre@@ am Rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tru@@ mp , arg@@ um@@ ed 2010 , that the Statue of Liberty doesn &apos;t inter@@ f@@ ere , but rather an early Ne@@ oc@@ on@@ serv@@ o who bring American Fl@@ ame into the world : &quot; Lady Liberty continues . &quot;
it is supposed to carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch should not enligh@@ ten the way into the United States . &quot;
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh here on something .
the meaning of the statue is completely and even a question of the stand@@ point of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus consisted of how they had seen from the exhaus@@ tible , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible travel to the de@@ cks of ships . &quot;
&quot; it is in the tru@@ est sense about seeing the world from the perspective of people , seek refu@@ ge and a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
her statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome to hear them .
and that is of course not the perspective that Mill@@ er and Tru@@ mp ever would like to recognise .
&quot; your tor@@ ch should not enligh@@ ten the way , but the hate that is their only source of power . &quot;
world Championships 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the Great Britain
E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle is remin@@ is@@ cent of a time when only two vill@@ i have belon@@ ged to the team of Great Britain
&quot; the perf@@ ector of the Ath@@ le@@ tics of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member cont@@ ingent of the World Championship has made a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 which starts on Friday .
&quot; black believes in Scotland a little special , and the ath@@ le@@ tics of the United Kingdom has to learn something from it . &quot;
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it , and we will continue to see until we find it out , &quot; said Black . &quot;
I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and think that it has done something to do with what they did .
the Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they did .
British ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they did .
and also with the type at the street corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes , medals are medals , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - to compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah , while E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle was elected by the team for the team captain . &quot;
&quot; E@@ ili@@ ie is quite modest .
&quot; their surrender @-@ speech was incredible , &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
&quot; the passion and the real feeling , the E@@ ili@@ ie all of course brought , were great . &quot;
&quot; the Commonwealth Silver medal , who will join her 5th World Championships for the 400 @-@ m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 Sch@@ r@@ ots are in the British team . &quot;
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship has been seven , the 1983 and 2015 were achieved . &quot;
the middle @-@ time Mu@@ ir leads on this way and has set up five British and two European records in the past year .
&quot; she will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 metres . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , the 1,500 m runs , is another sh@@ ear@@ piece , which one should observe the victory in the British team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games . &quot;
Do@@ yle is rem@@ inded of their first World Championships as the only other ch@@ ir@@ ons in the team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
&quot; the team captain &apos;s captain says that they are &quot; great pride &quot; to the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots do not only belong to the team but in some cases also with the medals and the Fin@@ als .
&quot; the particular team captain will be in it , is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honor , but knowing that my team members have voted for me and chose to have something very special for me , &quot; added them . &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the vill@@ i that belong to the team . &quot;
it shows only how far we came .
&quot; and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to rise on po@@ dium . &quot;
what is my speech as a captain ?
&quot; yes , I think she went well . &quot;
I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
&quot; so it is really important to put this home support and benefit from it , that we are again at the Olympiastadion . &quot;
I &apos;m getting a second chance to go there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there .
blocking of critics via Facebook : do not take you a public office if you are unable to wear the bur@@ sting of voters .
the Father of our country knew something of bad press .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not last long until the newspapers bend it because of the internal policy to its political principles . &quot;
he im@@ part@@ ed in criticism safe .
but he has not brought his critics to silence .
&quot; in 17@@ 83 Washington said , &quot; &quot; the freedom of expression can be taken away - and , stupid and m@@ ute we shall be led to the sheep . &quot;
&quot; this brings me to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an who must work on it , to be more like Washington . &quot;
Ho@@ gans staff have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union def@@ endant him from the beginning of this week .
&quot; the St@@ ab of the Govern@@ ors left the law@@ suit as fri@@ vo@@ l , and the online comment was full of a bac@@ kl@@ ash with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it is a type like h@@ og@@ an .
this is a rep@@ ublic@@ ans govern@@ or in a overwhelming democratic state that is ast@@ o@@ unding .
he has the two @-@ est consent of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary Hit@@ z@@ ead .
he has shown a fixed hand in the management of its state and strict adher@@ ence to principles .
he was also very sk@@ ill@@ fully to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and playful his ha@@ ired head after chemotherapy on his site .
&quot; therefore , the block@@ age of individuals who come to the side of the Govern@@ ors - that is a public Forum that is officially referred to as officially and by employees who are paid by public tax @-@ Dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse Ch@@ asse Ch@@ asse Ch@@ asse the acts of the Gover@@ ning Board and argu@@ ed that the block@@ ages of the comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; but it is too simple to use the image of tro@@ ugh@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or sp@@ lash @-@ filled people , which vibr@@ ate online the p@@ umping swing . &quot;
&quot; the post spoke with some of the real people , which were blocked by H@@ og@@ an . &quot;
&quot; and these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a past@@ or , no tro@@ ll@@ ables . &quot;
&quot; they all said that their comments are respect@@ ful , thought@@ ful and not prof@@ ane . &quot;
the past@@ or was the Bible in his post and appeal to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
&quot; attorney Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani by Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not h@@ asser@@ ted , but she asked to hate . &quot;
&quot; I commented ru@@ de that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate @-@ v@@ om@@ iting and other current news , &quot; wrote them in the commentary box of the message &quot; &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; I also appreciate this idea if a number of people on the same issue is taking place , then they are mis@@ used by some more than a so @-@ called collective action and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the staff of the Govern@@ ors as &quot; &quot; concentrated Spam attack &quot; &quot; would have other probably &quot; &quot; inter@@ c@@ ession &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Facebook era makes it easy to tri@@ bute a message by simply a man@@ ist , or a negative comment will be deleted . &quot;
&quot; it is much clean@@ er than in past times when you had done the same thing , that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical guidance and to burn or put demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
but that is exactly what is happening digital .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public officials who cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed that he has spar@@ ked Facebook and other social media .
President Tru@@ mp is indic@@ ted by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell last week in Virginia .
&quot; the chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County Ver@@ last the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Apostle James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when she called a voters on their Facebook page . &quot;
and K@@ entu@@ cky got Gover@@ nor Matt Be@@ an ( R ) also a visit to the AC@@ LU because of its use on Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be as heavy .
&quot; at the time of Washington , the time of affordable po@@ tos had a similar effect as the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers multip@@ lies between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous brief@@ ing slip on his leadership . &quot;
and even at that time Washington had an anonymous tro@@ ll@@ s .
&quot; the people , the pseu@@ dony@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; , &quot; wrote all letters of newspapers , the Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot;
&quot; petition on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , critic@@ ised its position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and navigation with the UK , overwhel@@ med its office , according to the historical documents that were collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project . &quot;
but he has not brought it to silence .
&quot; freedom of expression , dis@@ agreement and discour@@ se belong to the basis of our nation . &quot;
and true leadership means that to accept .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort at the Renaissance Club
&quot; the former Europeans No. 1 Ron@@ an raff@@ er@@ ty will hope in the next three days of domestic comfort , because the Renaissance Club held in East Lot@@ hi@@ an the 25th edition of Scottish senior Open . &quot;
&quot; Nor@@ di@@ re , who held next year next year at Arch@@ er@@ field links up to the ends , before he moved against Paul E@@ ales and acts as a tournament bu@@ ck@@ ner on behalf of the Association &apos;s founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built , and we see how he reaches his glory with this event , said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; the players will see this course from his best , he is in a great state . &quot;
Jerry has made a great job than he was set this place .
he is a eager writing of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
&quot; Engl@@ ish@@ man &apos;s E@@ ales is looking forward to defend a championship for the first time , although he won in his 32 @-@ year career with the European Tour as well as the European Challenge tour . &quot;
&quot; this really feels special , &quot; said the in South@@ port native players . &quot;
&quot; I have not able to defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open as it was in the year after I had won them , from the program . &quot;
back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on , last year here . &quot;
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciated .
&quot; Gary Or@@ r , who arrived at his 50@@ th birthday earlier this year to the European senior tour , returns to the promotion on home ground . &quot;
this event will be its first Scottish appearance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more if you play at home , &quot; Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to make it well , but you can also sense this additional pressure . &quot;
&quot; I really enjoyed it again , and I have played a solid Gulf . &quot;
I am glad that we have gone .
&quot; with the trio on the field the former Masters @-@ winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the Senior Major Champions Paul Bro@@ adh@@ ur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ er . &quot;
&quot; Or@@ r and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain of Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belong to the six vill@@ i on the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dru@@ m@@ mond . &quot;

less pul@@ mon@@ ary with Passi@@ v@@ rau@@ chen
in the past two decades less people have died less for passive exposure to lung cancer .
this result will scientists from the University of Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ ke ) in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates are attribut@@ able to Passi@@ v@@ rau@@ chen per year to Passi@@ v@@ rau@@ chen , &quot; &quot; says Ro@@ ko B@@ echer . &quot;

poverty and death in the Indonesian Gold@@ land

&quot; in her timber house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent@@ ail in the un@@ quiet ind@@ on@@ esian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually looks a sweet @-@ box - locally as &apos; not@@ a &apos; - directly in the fireplace . &quot;

&quot; nobody dar@@ ing it , after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was added in 1969 according to a contro@@ versi@@ al referendum in Indonesia , than just 1.0@@ 26 elders from the occup@@ ying forces . &quot;
&quot; an existing motion , which stir@@ red up for independence against the Dutch rule , turned out quickly against the government of Jak@@ arta , which holds control over the region and includes foreign journalists or legal observations of it . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , with the independent part of Pap@@ ua New gu@@ ine@@ as the eastern part of the island . &quot;

&quot; earlier we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indonesian in the poorest region where 28 % of men live under the poverty line and have some of the worst child &apos;s mort@@ ality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesian of gold .
&quot; the largest and most profitable gold mine of the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a strongh@@ olds in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort was built in the value of 3,@@ 1 billion US dollars and copper . &quot;
Pap@@ ua has a lot of valued 78 billion US dollars over the world .
&quot; however , these rich@@ es are however a source of mis@@ ery for the Pap@@ ua , ensuring that Indonesian military has retained a sti@@ cking presence . &quot;
&quot; an investigation from 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort local military units and units between 1998 and 2004 almost 20 million US dollars paid , including up to 150,000 US dollars to a single officer . &quot;
Pap@@ u@@ ans demands threat@@ ening a greater autonomy to the Golden G@@ ans and are treated in mer@@ min@@ ation .
&quot; according to the activi@@ sts , more than 500,000 Pap@@ ua have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed since 1969 of the Indonesian military , tor@@ tured and det@@ ained . &quot;
mass@@ ages in papers in Pap@@ u@@ as stem from the 1970 @-@ Human Rights Commission were established in accordance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission to commit gen@@ ocide .
the Indonesian police last year alone was more than 3.@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators in the past year .
&quot; we value All Ver@@ sions &quot; &quot; welcomes it in a report of the Arch@@ di@@ oc@@ ese Bris@@ bane dating back to 2016 , in which reports about atro@@ cities of the previous year are , like about un@@ law@@ ns and torture - r@@ ape and electro@@ des are particularly popular in a different report - and the brutal defe@@ ats of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims because every week will happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researchers for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
screws have intensified because Pap@@ u@@ as resources have a influ@@ x of settl@@ ers from other parts of Indonesia .
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is to 83 % Christian , but demo@@ graphic development is changing , since mus@@ cular economic immigrants from the pop@@ ulated islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ aw@@ esi come . &quot;

&quot; the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known in the masses and as Jok@@ ow@@ i , spoke during his election campaign in 2014 to address the ine@@ qualities and the legal violations of Pap@@ ua . &quot;
the former Zimmermann secured 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
&quot; but in Pap@@ ua has changed little , and today the locals feel che@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with the expect@@ ation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai actually erl@@ itz only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is initiation in October a deep @-@ point . &quot;
on 7 December 2014 a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas lie@@ der in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali as two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle through the darkness .
the sc@@ ro@@ cking children told them that they should switch their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers took on her tone and came back later with four soldiers , the local past@@ or Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had dr@@ unk , ch@@ asing and sm@@ ote the group with their col@@ ouring , told victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers suffered into the group of children .
&quot; a child , the 16 @-@ year Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so heavy be@@ aten that he fell into the compromise . &quot;
a few hours later the building of the nearby governmental commission set out on fire and things escal@@ ate the next day .
&quot; about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered together on a football field before the local police station and the Military Commander centre to request justice . &quot;
they tru@@ ffle hunting and led the Wa@@ ita dance - in the circle constantly and a bird @-@ con@@ i@@ timate - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago tribe .
some prot@@ esters began stones on police and military post .
&quot; when the mood was heated , the soldiers was sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses are more than three times resistance , they shoot them dead , &quot; says it in an official document of TI@@ ME , which has not been released by local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the leader of the K@@ oto K@@ oto @-@ quarter of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the dro@@ ught danger and called for rest and called for the amount to return home . &quot;
no one was to be heard in the mood .
&quot; when I turned off , I suddenly turned into my lin@@ kes wr@@ ist wr@@ ist , &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the porch of his multic@@ olo@@ red wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame still does not know who has fallen apart , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered together . &quot;
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fil@@ med &quot; , &quot; he adds . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was three times , so his c@@ ous@@ in , the witness of the shooting was . &quot;
&quot; I burned him and bes@@ ought his body to make sure he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who only carries a name , the TI@@ ME in d@@ ü@@ ster@@ er mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him .
&quot; the Che@@ ese spec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told re@@ por@@ ters that his officers &quot; wanted to save their station only &quot; , &quot; because they will be attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves if people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; said the speaker of Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators have been killed and many others in@@ ju@@ red . &quot;
the news about the k@@ ill@@ ings came only on the following day &apos; fil@@ tered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
&quot; three weeks he held Jok@@ ow@@ i in H@@ ap@@ ura a passionate talk , in which he expressed sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims and fluctu@@ ate , the historical confusion in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; I would like this case immediately , so that it will no longer happen in the future . &quot;
&quot; security sm@@ ini@@ ster Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 , that he entered a extr@@ aj@@ udi@@ cial mechanism to lead historical human rights violations . &quot;
but they began almost immediately .
&quot; most of the injuries occurred a long time ago .
some were in the 90 @-@ ern and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ year .
&quot; the point is that we have committed to address these violations , but there are processes that must be run through , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; then he made a withdrawal when he spoke on June 5th in Jak@@ arta with TI@@ ME , and said , he did not have plans , in Pap@@ ua a complaint mechanism . &quot;
&quot; instead , everything is governed by law , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Wir@@ anto , indic@@ ted the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; , &quot; said the more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ ors of Independence of Independence , said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Pap@@ ua said , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims took such claims with gri@@ m un@@ believers .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear later .
&quot; I have fear , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have fear to be arrested by the military , have fear to be shot . &quot;
&quot; his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us re@@ peti@@ tive the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai fear have to discuss the incident . &quot;
&quot; he says that he was be@@ aten by the military , after he helped him to bury four of the victims . &quot;
&quot; after I buried the corp@@ ses , the military sought after me , &quot; he says . &quot;
the shooting did not have stopped .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a confrontation between the village and the manager of a b@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma , which ref@@ used to bring a conscious man to the hospital , a person and 17 others were in@@ ju@@ red , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , the dro@@ w@@ ned was , when he died in a nearby river , died on the way to hospital . &quot;
on the vill@@ agers prot@@ esting in front of the office of the company .
the police said that the vill@@ agers were st@@ elled on officers who re@@ acted upon it by warning .
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( Indonesian police ) began to shoot the amount of shoot and a k@@ iller .
&quot; we were so in panic , we have fear that it will give reven@@ ge , says the 29 @-@ year Dom@@ ing@@ gu Badi@@ i , who lives near the hospital house and witness was how the recent ones have been delivered here quickly , so the TI@@ ME . &quot;
&quot; I have hidden two days in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai parliament has called to account the officers involved and retreat the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade of police from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai has always been an accident for Indonesian Government .
&quot; the lack of sensu@@ al development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the tri@@ bal nationality , mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al , which live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; many adher@@ ed to the &quot; &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , which claims to defend the rights of Pap@@ ua , by stim@@ ulating spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and de@@ duction of ind@@ on@@ esian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top @-@ O@@ PM guide come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to this , thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai in recent years and is arbitrary , under the pre@@ text of the &quot; securing of national sovereignty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are never dive again .
&quot; among the people in Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty rein@@ forces the dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice that is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is expensive for locals too expensive .
bread is just as apart .
the people here build everything to eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
&quot; agriculture is the task of women , which can process four or five fields of conf@@ ection@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; they retain the bulk of harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market . &quot;
ten pieces Not@@ a dear only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 C@@ ents ) . &quot;
&quot; over time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between local Pap@@ ua and the new immigrants since the opening of new routes to the airport Nab@@ ire in larger numbers have arrived . &quot;
the few jobs that exist in the region generally go to the better educated and weal@@ thy migrants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to make their own company competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because here there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the Chief Council of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
isolation holds the eyes of the world from Pap@@ ua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions of reporting international media remain stra@@ ined . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the French journalist Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Basi@@ cally Long@@ ch@@ amp were portr@@ ayed because of lack of co @-@ ordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although they were given the rare permission to the films . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ in K@@ ine , the dep@@ uty Asia @-@ Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is elect@@ oral campaign , the limitations of reporting to promote transparency and development is not realised . &quot;
&quot; there are new haz@@ ards to foreign journalists who try to report from Indonesian &apos;s un@@ peaceful eastern provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua to report : visa @-@ den@@ ial and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in March , six p@@ acific States - Tong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ in@@ seln and the Sal@@ om@@ ones @-@ Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; different and widespread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting . &quot;
the same countries have historically supported the O@@ PM .
&quot; the sp@@ okes@@ man of the Indonesian State Department of Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r pointed the suburbs of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there is free media so that it is difficult to hide the evidence of human rights inci@@ dents . &quot;
people on site want more foreign governments to take note of this .
&quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of human right @-@ amb@@ ass@@ ters K@@ ees Van B@@ aar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura on 4 May visited him &quot; &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source which also took part in the meeting , but remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia also has another presidential election , but the Pap@@ ua &apos;s say that they probably will not be right again for Jok@@ ow@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is involved by the people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai &apos;s treasures , says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the Chief Council . &quot;
&quot; he wants to know that Jok@@ ow@@ i know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that it is under the permanent threat of a military military , living in ar@@ sel@@ ective gu@@ ardi@@ ans and health care . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai folks , like other Pap@@ ua , to consider their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; gu@@ ilt &quot; which he has to pay back . &quot;
&quot; they do not need money , they just want justice , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite the threats and intim@@ i@@ dation , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai attacks had a last symbolic act of f@@ ool : the corp@@ se of an O@@ pf@@ ers was buried in a terrain exactly opposite the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that they might never give justice to them , but at least they do not forget their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with sear@@ ched head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scrap@@ ers from Dubai for the second time
&quot; a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest towers of the world in Dubai , to give hundreds of residents , from 337 meters high , 79 @-@ sto@@ rey building . &quot;
&quot; it is the second brand , which is defe@@ ated in just two years by the sky@@ scr@@ aper , which one has been called the Tor@@ ch @-@ Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was evac@@ u@@ ated , injuries were not reported and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; we slept and we were standing at fire , and at the cry of the people . &quot;
&quot; we burned down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come from the 50@@ th floor down , told a residents who spoke his name as George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters . &quot;
Dub@@ ais Civil Protection Auth@@ orities said that the units of fire fighting against 4.00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 pm GMT ) the fire extingu@@ ished and the building cooler .

no Davis Cup reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International tennis courts ( IT@@ F ) has fallen down with its large Davis Cup @-@ Cou@@ p at the Annual General Meeting .
&quot; at the meeting in Ho @-@ Chi @-@ Min@@ h city the proposal was supported to play this Sport revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup single still on two scores , Hau@@ ch@@ thin@@ ly not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority . &quot;
&quot; this is often very long , but it is therefore very estimated five @-@ set classics to stay the traditional value . &quot;
6@@ 3.@@ 54 per cent of the member countries voted for the reform to the aim of the IT@@ F @-@ President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty therefore only slightly ver@@ itable .
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members are not accepted the entire reform package for Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these icon@@ ic and historical competitions , &quot; said Hag@@ g@@ ty . &quot;
man will continue to work on improving the applic@@ ant .
&quot; not until the vote was not only before the vote had already been made , the finale at a neutral place to apply . &quot;
new from 2018 are only comparable minor details : so the fin@@ alists in Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be able to have the host right in the first round in the first round .
&quot; to reduce the costs for the organizer , the requirements are facilit@@ ated in terms of training places , etc. and the players will have to complete prior to the Davis Cup less official media dates . &quot;
more than 1 out of 5 US travelers brings more objects into the aircraft and find a survey
&quot; a survey of passengers y@@ iel@@ ded out that over 20 per cent more conscious or un@@ aware compar@@ ing items to check@@ points of the US Transportation Security Administration pass over , including at least 6 percent which occupy the aircraft , while they acci@@ dentally deleted kni@@ ves or other objects with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 per cent believed , they would have been del@@ ayed that they may be irrit@@ ated with fire@@ arms , amm@@ unition , or explosive . &quot;
&quot; the survey of more than 1,000 people - that was performed by a jet charter service , the STR@@ ATOS Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , performed - also presented that younger travelers are rather ab@@ ide by the rules . &quot;
&quot; from the respon@@ dents , the en@@ co@@ res that they know@@ ingly tried to fly with something that was banned by the T@@ SA , were 19,@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als , compared to less than 15 percent , members of the generation X . &quot;
&quot; the most common items that were mis@@ understood by T@@ SA agents , were food and flu@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; more than 3 percent gave them to have worn @-@ related items with Bl@@ ades through the safety control , whereas 2,@@ 2 percent of the female sur@@ vey@@ ed and 3.7 percent of the male respon@@ dents said , that they could have brought visible drugs into the plane . &quot;
&quot; the company said , it has inter@@ viewed travelers in the whole country to figure out how many acci@@ dentally would have brought sm@@ ug@@ gling by the airport security and how many it would have done . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that people , the most frequent sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ware - whis@@ ingly , or un@@ s@@ wis@@ s@@ ingly - by security wear , those who were most often flying . &quot;
however the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are a little complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often un@@ certain which liquids they may take away or how much of it .
&quot; so , there is no surprise that the largest quantity of the items are bot@@ tled out by the T@@ SA . &quot;
a time thought the people the T@@ SA could see books as sm@@ ug@@ gling .
&quot; flu@@ ids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights . &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k is it no matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la @-@ customers / Order
&quot; elec@@ tro @-@ thousands El@@ on Mus@@ k will be happy to compete with the huge number of pre@@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , he has so far beat out that some of the clients has already with@@ drawn their non @-@ binding reservation . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the always tri@@ ump@@ hal@@ en figures too sales and even more gigantic st@@ akes , Tes@@ la @-@ Chief El@@ on Mus@@ k at the announcement of the recent quarterly reports for the first time a different , less exceptional number married : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ k has frequently adverti@@ sed in recent months with more than 500,000 reservations for the new car , the delivery currently starts . &quot;
&quot; now , Mus@@ k : from a total of 5@@ 18.@@ 000 pre@@ orders have been with@@ drawn from 6@@ 3,000 already . &quot;
critics always pointed out that it is merely a non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; in case of cancellation Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the USA 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; currently , b@@ lows 45@@ ,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations made before , sp@@ ective M@@ k in a telephone conference with an@@ alysts . &quot;
&quot; however , the cancellation of up to previously twelve percent of all orders could be used to the problem , the Tes@@ la chef does not believe . &quot;
&quot; its argument : the challenge of the ambitious growth aim is not in demand , but on the production site . &quot;
last year Tes@@ la 8@@ 4,000 vehicles delivered .
&quot; in 2018 , it is to be put together on all models - 500@@ .000 , 2020 a million . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , the day 1800 reservations are coming to . &quot;
&quot; who today orders a &quot; Model 3 &quot; must be expected in the second half of 2018 with delivery - if Tes@@ la es creates , his brand @-@ new , even never in practice tested manufacturing roads without greater inter@@ rup@@ tions with maximum utilization . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; however , it comes to major delays , then the in@@ binding of the reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; because then , the company can not hin@@ ge the company of un@@ satisfied customers , in Sch@@ aren . &quot;
EP@@ A Chef Pru@@ itt casts himself up because of the exp@@ anders of the rules of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a to reduce emissions
&quot; a day after being tried out of 15 states , he accepted Scott , the boss of the environ@@ ment@@ ing authority , his former decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions of smo@@ g @-@ caused air@@ sh@@ ad@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; Pru@@ itt presented the change , as its agency proved to meet the needs of state environmental authorities towards re@@ active faster than previous administration . &quot;
he didn &apos;t mentioned the law@@ suit was raised against his previous place in a federal court .
&quot; it is a deadline , which ran out on 1 October for states to hold the standards of 2015 for ground floor o@@ zone . &quot;
&quot; Pru@@ dential announced in June , that he will be able to delay a year to study his authority more time to study the Plan and to avoid economic growth in local decisions . &quot;
&quot; Pru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tru@@ mp &apos;s prosec@@ ut@@ or from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a long time a reliable opponent &apos;s internal environmental protection regulations . &quot;
&quot; since its arrival in Washington , it is repeated repeated to block rain regulations or delay the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the most recent legal return for the pru@@ dent Roll@@ back agenda .
&quot; last month , a federal court in Washington has decided that the EP@@ A st@@ ew@@ ter has exceeded his authority as he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , the oil and gas company for monitoring and reduction of meth@@ an@@ lec@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; in one on Mit@@ tw@@ och@@ et &apos;s opinion , it proposed that its K@@ ehr@@ an de O@@ Oz@@ on@@ ization is simply the willingness of the EP@@ A to co @-@ operation with the countries by the complex process of timely performance of the new standards . &quot;
&quot; under previous administration the EP@@ A often met the deadlines for carrying out , and then wa@@ ited by activ@@ ating groups and others , and in an agreement proposed for the implementation , &quot; said Pru@@ itt , who def@@ endants the EP@@ A more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation by jurisdiction , and we take deadlines seriously . &quot;
&quot; we also take the law and authority we exist , seriously . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the EP@@ A memor@@ andum from the EP@@ A , that it will eventually take advantage of its &quot; authority to the delay and all others &quot; &quot; authority &quot; &quot; to ensure that the rules are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the rep@@ ublic@@ ans in the Congress will push for a comprehensive re@@ alizing new version of the o@@ zone .
one in the last month of approved legislation is to delay the implementation of the rules of 2015 at least eight years .
the measure was not yet provided in the Senate .
&quot; the New York General @-@ General @-@ lawyer Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of the States who had charged the EP@@ A in this week , said the group intend to sustain the legal pressure . &quot;
&quot; the conversion of EP@@ A - after our peti@@ tions - is an important gain for health and safety of these 6,@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and that are more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g , who flows into their churches , &quot; said Se@@ der@@ man . &quot;
&quot; new York , in this case California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ien , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia . &quot;
&quot; floor o@@ zone is created when contam@@ in@@ ants of cars , power plants , oil refined , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere are responding to sunlight . &quot;
the ent@@ standing smo@@ g can cause sensitive groups of people serious breathing difficulties and can contribute to thousands of premature death cases .
representatives of the public health care and the environ@@ ment@@ alist che@@ ered over Pru@@ d@@ oom at a surprising change of course .
&quot; it is disturbing how much pressure it takes to obtain this reasonable step by the responsible for the protection of air we inhal@@ e , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Diversity . &quot;
&quot; we must continue to fight against the ide@@ ological Crus@@ ade of the Tru@@ mp @-@ government , in environmental pollution and their particular interests . &quot;

Association wants to review permission of bicycles
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; re@@ vered itself &quot; &quot; does not see a legal prerequisite for the construction and has therefore turned on land to land . &quot;
&quot; the association &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; has been asked &quot; &quot; Land@@ Council Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) , his permission for the establishment of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette . &quot;
it is illegal .
the association arg@@ um@@ ented that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette no wind turbines would have been approved as at the time in Vier@@ sen only on the border line to swal@@ lows a wind @-@ force area .
&quot; within this concentration area , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but also causes the concentration zone , but a exclusion of wind approach for the rest area . &quot;
such zones should prevent a &quot; reduction &quot; of the landscape .
&quot; the city of Vier@@ sen had a second wind @-@ centr@@ alised zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , but had not approved the District government in Düsseldorf , due to a fault error . &quot;
&quot; by the lack of plan@@ ing legal prerequisite , the er@@ shared per@@ missible has been un@@ constitutional , and therefore also returned , said Christopher Er@@ kens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; current state of affairs : the city council entered again before the summer break , the wind @-@ centr@@ ation zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette decided ; a permission of the District government is still standing . &quot;
&quot; in this place , the issu@@ ance of a permit for the establishment of wind turbines are legally excluded . &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the invitation .
&quot; the corresponding letter has been entered into the circle last week , &quot; explained a sp@@ okes@@ person . &quot;
the circle makes it the occasion to consider the issue once again .
they do not lead to that the procedure is stopped .
&quot; with a view of the ongoing proceedings of the Board of Directors , the circle did not want to express itself to the arg@@ um@@ entation of the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NEW Re , a subsidiary of NEW , plans on an area at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette building the construction of four per 200 meters high wind . &quot;
&quot; already last year the company had been involved in which the city has been involved in the city of Vier@@ sen , P@@ acht@@ ver@@ y@@ ields with the owner of approximately 65 hectares of great money . &quot;
with erection of four wind turbines the power needs to be covered by around 11 400 households - this corresponds to approximately one fifth of the electricity demand of all four @-@ sen@@ ders households .
the NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros .
in the past summer there was quarter @-@ giving light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind park Lin@@ ni@@ ch near Aachen and a stake in a wind turbines in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg district in Hein@@ sberg .

also attractive offers for Saturday and ren@@ unci@@ ation on par@@ amount to this day are part of the concept .

&quot; on 27 January he called Tru@@ mp in a phone with the Mexican president En@@ ri@@ que Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to , to declare that he would not pay for a planned bo@@ unds . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. president disgu@@ ised him because he had openly den@@ oun@@ ced the wall without saying , &quot; &quot; said he said to him , &quot; &quot; this can not say you of the press . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp started its presidential campaign with the promise , on the southern border of the USA to build a wall , and fluctu@@ ate , Mexico for the project . &quot;
Tran@@ scription of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .

m@@ oo@@ res Ford @-@ Mass@@ aker : activi@@ sts lead to rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice
&quot; an 1948 @-@ er Ford Mer@@ cury was driven by a group of spect@@ ators in rural Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and ru@@ mp@@ ed onto the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver had to reach the bridge , a group of white men came out to block its way . &quot;
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a man middle age in a needle @-@ train - took a long train at his c@@ ig@@ ar and looked after the wind@@ shield .
inside we@@ aves the in@@ m@@ ates in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; br@@ aces the man . &quot;
&quot; let him out of the car ! &quot;
Schre@@ ie cr@@ acking the silence , as a young black man of the passenger seat . &quot;
&quot; luck@@ ily this terrible scene , which was played on 22 July , only one post@@ p@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; but when then a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; Roger , &quot; sti@@ lt almost all in the audience is very real sig@@ h . &quot;
&quot; since 2005 we come back to the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge back to im@@ itate the night , in the two black pairs - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com , as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u K@@ lux Kl@@ an in 1946 . &quot;
nobody ever was indic@@ ted because of the Mor@@ de .
&quot; it is truly unbe@@ atable that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we know them in our communities , although we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ r@@ one Bro@@ oks , who helps with the organization of delivery . &quot;
&quot; it is a contam@@ ination on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Bro@@ oks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former congresses of the state of Georgia and for a lifetime of a citizen .
&quot; for him , it serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual memory of the Mon@@ roe Community that has never been corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want criminal proceedings , we want to end up , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must receive justice , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; we cannot reach healing and reconciliation , until we receive justice . &quot;
a lecturer about the lam@@ ination of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ n on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to F@@ BI files , who have been received from the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and surrounding Graf@@ ships were sus@@ pic@@ tured in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process . &quot;
but none has ever been charged .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects have been on an open @-@ foot for decades , citizenship , that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch @-@ actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , made a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice made the black citizens in Georgia for the first time , in the pre @-@ deadline for their voice in summer . &quot;
&quot; about at the same time as choosing st@@ ach according to information of the F@@ BI of black Far@@ mp@@ s Roger Mal@@ com , a white basic owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a struggle - suppos@@ edly because of a woman . &quot;
&quot; Bro@@ oks said , the sm@@ ells in the city was that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby , which carried her , not by her husband . &quot;
&quot; on 25 July 1946 Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent wel@@ ded land owner , 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from the prison , so the F@@ BI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
&quot; but when they left away from the prison , and the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge fre@@ ed , um@@ ring@@ ed a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison that has prepared and arranged the Mor@@ rison , and includes here a F@@ BI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also evident that there was a complete agreement between the state and local criminal proceedings , which was not only involved in the mor@@ den , evidence , and the identity of witnesses has changed . &quot;
Bro@@ oks form@@ ulates it still prepar@@ atory .
&quot; it was a elect@@ oral mass@@ ac@@ re , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; if you sign up and when you vote , then you will happen here . &quot;
almost a decade of Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual delivery of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
&quot; their representation is vivid , gri@@ pping and is based in a kind of deep racism that many believe he does not exist in America . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to look at , and even more difficult to look , but Gre@@ ene said that that is the point . &quot;
&quot; we do not want to talk about the Lyn@@ chen , because we are then confronted with its ugly in all of us , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; but I cannot build any relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or not to hear , what I have done . &quot;
&quot; the rehear@@ sals for this year began in June , and on the first day began almost 30 actors - a dozen wheat and the rest bl@@ acks - into a room and lou@@ der , as Gre@@ ene started a well received overview of the piece . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ase Co @-@ Director .
&quot; he has played the role of the Chief Executive Board for years , but he said , the role will never become easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty because I am not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; but I think it is very important to get this story alive , because we would not want to return to these times . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the room rehear@@ sed the actors D@@ itar@@ us Brad@@ sh@@ aw and Nick Ras@@ cona , the Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester play their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester , and likes it , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy . &quot;
&quot; I said , n --- he , w@@ asting by my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona re@@ es the fire .
there is a rest .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laugh@@ s at the lau@@ gh .
&quot; what ? ! &quot; , asked Ras@@ cona . &quot;
it is al@@ armed and confused .
I was too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still k@@ ich@@ ern@@ d . &quot;
&quot; I just don &apos;t think that white people at that time &apos;@@ n --- he said . &quot;
&quot; but , wit@@ ched one of the other black performers . &quot;
&quot; you only need to meet the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
&quot; and that is exactly that the energy in space , a feeling of compan@@ ionship re@@ places the discomfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy doing so right not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four persons killed . &quot;
the scene begins once again .
&quot; this time , when Ras@@ cona the N @-@ word , he says it sharp and with im@@ print . &quot;
absolutely nobody is laugh@@ ing .
this re@@ petition ends non@@ violent and fast .
&quot; there are Schre@@ ie , shots and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman , cloth@@ ed with a trau@@ ma @-@ dress , stands above the corp@@ ses of the actor and performs Bil@@ lie Holidays , &quot; Str@@ ange Fruit &quot; . &quot; &quot;
your voice breaks every second word .
&quot; about a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen of conf@@ esses and tears from the eyes . &quot;
the audience is divided almost uni@@ form@@ ly between black and white .
&quot; a pair is made of I@@ th@@ aca , New York , inspired to see the performance , many come only the street . &quot;
they have experienced all almost eight hours of Georgi@@ ou@@ trag@@ eous humidity when Bro@@ oks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ e@@ ers of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
&quot; up to this point , the Mor@@ de stayed an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote now , but now when you found on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch Mor@@ de workshop , the air feels like . &quot;
&quot; sound the last notes of the song , Gre@@ ene loads the amount to come closer and insp@@ ecting the corp@@ ses . &quot;
children ho@@ cken to their heads , sign the counter@@ f@@ eit blood and the breast@@ feeding of each other . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ ine a little boy , when he wants to remember it . &quot;
after a few minutes the Gre@@ ene of the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw the Lyn@@ ch @-@ rope and wi@@ pe their tears .
Brad@@ sh@@ aw um@@ ar@@ mt Mar@@ bau@@ gh that has played the man in the move that the cl@@ an member has played .
Nick Ras@@ cona embr@@ aces two of his fellow players and then breaks down in her arms crying to the emotional load of the performance finally breaks through him .
&quot; it is okay , whis@@ per@@ ing one of the women . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you have done that for a reason . &quot;
later the audience is working together with the actors for dinner .
at a table pl@@ au@@ ded a white pair of Atlanta stim@@ ulated above the re @-@ adjustment with a black pair that they have just met .
&quot; Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski fought about to find words , which feeling the performance . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... from people coming like you look and who do what they look like &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what that really is doing with me , lets me believe that the Lyn@@ chen still exists today , &quot; he added , &quot; today the only police shooting are called . &quot;
&quot; in the same room Ty@@ r@@ one Bro@@ oks Hof at his table , he e@@ ats and commemor@@ ates the civil rights . &quot;
&quot; he said , he already started to plan the performance in the next year . &quot;
&quot; the re @-@ purpose is inspir@@ ational because it describes the fri@@ ght of what we have to bear , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is so , if we learn anything from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; he did not study his own story , who doesn &apos;t know his own story , is do@@ omed to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Göt@@ ter@@ d@@ ämmerung &quot; &quot; reconc@@ iled the w@@ agn@@ eri@@ an in Bay@@ re@@ uth &quot;

&quot; one noted that the audience has grown up with the &quot; Ring &quot; in a certain way , &quot; she had said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot;
&quot; the audience has not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but also an understanding of its visibility . &quot;

&quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ professional volunteer . &quot;
how does that come from ?
quantity : I made Ab@@ it@@ ur .
&quot; and then a civil engineer , say we say successfully abandoned . &quot;
I have recognized for me that there is a wrong one for me and I want to do something else with people .
and then I asked me what is doing .
&quot; a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , in the focal point perhaps , really is . &quot;
and was it so ?
quantity : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the winter semester .
&quot; I will study dual , probably do in the Ju@@ gen@@ da@@ mt Her@@ ne a social worker training and study in Ham@@ m at the Fach@@ hoch@@ schule . &quot;
is it not something unusual to have several different locations throughout the volunteer ?
&quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
it always comes to that where to make his F@@ S@@ J .
you can make it possible from Al@@ ter@@ sheim to juven@@ ile work - in all kinds of fac@@ ets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
&quot; I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care . &quot;
for me this was exactly the right thing that has taken me straight .
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really is possible .
other than in the Civil Engineering ?
&quot; quantity : well clear , here it is not about to count . &quot;
one has always another human head to have a completely different story behind it .
&quot; whether a refuge@@ e , whether a youth who has been fet@@ ched out of the family - you must always come individually . &quot;
very interesting .
and you did not have a touch ?
&quot; quantity : therefore , I am not the guy . &quot;
it is an area that gives a lot .
&quot; great love , lots of kindness . &quot;
&quot; there is also negative moments , but so that life is just . &quot;

EP@@ A returns decision to del@@ ayed the smo@@ g rule to Kl@@ agen
&quot; the US @-@ American environmental authority has a decision to delay a regulation of the government of Obama , wai@@ ved the States to imp@@ lied the smo@@ g @-@ caused emissions . this was a day after 15 countries def@@ endants the agency because of the stri@@ de . &quot;
&quot; the EP@@ A announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the &quot; &quot; Oz@@ on@@ tives 2015 &quot; &quot; and said , they show the obligation of the agency to co @-@ operate with countries . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and remember that we react to our state partners , &quot; &quot; EP@@ A chef Scott Pru@@ itt in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in June , the intention of EP@@ A announced the intention of EP@@ A , the O@@ zone @-@ regulations which must be measured in a part of the country of poll@@ ut@@ ant emissions to adhere to stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year up to October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , handed down on Tuesday K@@ ay and said that the endeav@@ or is illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tru@@ mp has tried to rise a broad range of environmental conditions , which the former president Barack Obama has risen , as part of a broader agenda , which is to boost economic growth , according to Tru@@ mp &apos;s economic growth . &quot;
&quot; however , the efforts have triggered the feedback of Democrats and reserves , who are worried about the effects of greater emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the website of the EP@@ A says that the inhal@@ ation of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; the pul@@ mon@@ ology to reduce and increase the symp@@ tom symptoms &quot; as for example as@@ thma . &quot;
community @-@ community wants common space
&quot; in the end , the decision was clear : in two oppos@@ ing the council decides by Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ z@@ eln , the establishment of a common area in the future senior residence . &quot;
&quot; before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the still missing basic piece was signed , says Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; although it will still last until the present church belonging to the church belonging to the community is owned , but there is now no plans for making a private investor to the project . &quot;
&quot; for this , there is a discussion concerning a shared space . &quot;
&quot; one of the two investors , which are still in the boat , has offered to meet the community . &quot;
on the ground floor he would have a living space - approximately 55 square meter - and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square meters area for a special price .
&quot; the administration and majority of the municipal council ple@@ aded before , such a common area is not just as meeting place for the residents of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ ative residence , but open to the church . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word of &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot;
&quot; the decision , which has been decided by providing funds for the current budget already in the last autumn , caused by funding . &quot;
the construction is in the renovation area .
&quot; the establishment of a common space would be , thus reported T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent eligible . &quot;
&quot; the decision proposal can be seen in order to sign@@ alling the investor to sign@@ alling him in this respect , which is ren@@ oun@@ ced in this respect - which is reduced to the ambient height - as well as pen@@ ing height , and the construction of economic power - it would be possible . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less , so does not only Wil@@ fried So@@ h@@ mer , be this addi@@ tive . &quot;
if &apos; s helps : unanim@@ ously happens the body .
it is not as easy as the common room .
&quot; Daniela &apos;s reputation refers to the many own buildings , with which one can &apos;t get pretty good enough to get there at the common room from the window , she says : &quot; I do so hard with it . &quot;
Yv@@ onne Sta@@ iger is absolutely talking to the common room - but absolutely against a municipal participation .
it is behind it a conc@@ e@@ aled sub@@ stitution in any case @-@ producing or even foreign investors .
&quot; that is not so , because with the purchase of the surface you do not give up a grant , but be@@ es a real , in two @-@ case market@@ able , is the counter @-@ speech . &quot;
&quot; Sta@@ ig@@ ers &apos;s application , the qu@@ arri@@ er must be applied accordingly , there are three advoc@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; so it remains for two mut@@ iny at the original program , Stefan H@@ aller so summar@@ izes : &quot; &quot; when we summ@@ ed up the decision , we make a giant step in our infrastructure . &quot;

the man was shining on the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was brought to a hospital with a retreat .

Trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti has to ren@@ oun@@ ce in the Du@@ el with the BV@@ B also to David Al@@ aba .
he confirmed the Itali@@ ans on Friday .

for the five defe@@ ats in the past 6 tests An@@ cel@@ otti has made the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team .
&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot;
that was last not good . &quot;
&quot; however , the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in the first official game of the season . &quot;
&quot; soccer is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot;
I have big trust that my team shows this qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; we want to play intelligent , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; tri@@ cky , intense game . &quot; &quot;

hiking in the Harz Mountains of star
in the resin the nationwide &quot; Star@@ en@@ pf@@ ad &quot; is supposed to emerge .
this is planning the club observ@@ atory of Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
an planet@@ arium is in Gött@@ ingen - since 2003 .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Star@@ en@@ pf@@ ad &quot; &quot; come to the information of the needs of many Har@@ z@@ visitors , it was called . &quot;
&quot; he connect nature , science , movement and sports performance . &quot;
members want to sit down along the planned route and inform it about stars and constell@@ ations .
in a first phase until 2018 the association is planning &quot; well achiev@@ able installations in five to six places &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z .
&quot; wonder : St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber . &quot;
the information on the tables should be supplem@@ ented by internet .
&quot; therefore , on the site @-@ election a good mobile network reception plays a part . &quot;
accessibility is a criterion .
later the Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ad train is to be extended by train .
&quot; on the star@@ ch path , the spect@@ ators learn much useful information , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; explained the association . &quot;
&quot; moreover , they learned why stars could have different colors or why a star stronger lamp than another , although he is much further away . &quot;
I will also be convey@@ ed in which constell@@ ation is a selected star @-@ well and when it is best to be seen .
the association has been running in the Berg@@ städ@@ t of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg which is the highest located observ@@ atory North Germany since 2014 .
&quot; the site is in the middle of the National Park , in accordance with statements by the Federal Ministry for Nature Conservation to the six dark@@ est regions in Germany . &quot;
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a gal@@ axy clearly to see with naked eye .
in the uni @-@ city there has been a bit simil@@ arity since 2003 on the initiative of the Planet@@ arium Gött@@ ingen something like the planned ral@@ lies - the planet@@ arium .
&quot; beginning before Geb@@ h@@ ardi@@ um Hotel in Goe@@ the@@ all@@ ee , the planetary path leads up to the Hain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as a &quot; extr@@ ater@@ restrial location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( community ) with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
the staves with the individual planets - including the Pl@@ uto g@@ apped dem@@ uto at the end point - are precisely at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ unk to a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ metres in diameter while the exact 75 meters away from the sun is at least 70 cen@@ timet@@ res .
the entire distance of the planet is about four kilometres .
&quot; while the light needed from sun to Pl@@ uto approximately eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to the st@@ ems with Pl@@ uto . &quot;
pedestri@@ ans are therefore faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march to the next fixed @-@ star but would still be half a year .
Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time to discuss a possible show@@ down
&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia , who in a coll@@ is@@ ion@@ ic should stand in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ covered World Box@@ ing Council , the corri@@ dor down to welcome Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Box@@ ing organization Super @-@ fe@@ ather @-@ Champion . &quot;
after Gar@@ ci@@ as victory through un@@ ison@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ divisions World Champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time are both fighters members of the top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ List .
&quot; Gar@@ cia stretched the right hand and said , &quot; How do you think , Champion ? &quot;
I wish you good luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko is defending its belt against Miguel Marri@@ aga on Satur@@ day@@ evening at 7 PM on ES@@ PN .
&quot; when the pair of pictures pos@@ sessions , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ ma , that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect scale &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a former fe@@ ather @-@ weight , &quot; remembered Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; I have asc@@ ended for bronze &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I am not so big . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to go down al@@ weight .
and he must move on light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
these require the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko coinci@@ ded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; boxes needs this battle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Kli@@ ma asked if it should be in pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that meeting Lom@@ ach@@ enko with a 135 pounds de@@ bug@@ ging in this year , in order to agree on the fight against the winner of Jor@@ ge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their light @-@ weight campaign in the forum on September 23 . &quot;
&quot; this struggle could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode , because all the fans have asked for him , said Gar@@ cia and oppressed itself later to fight with the network that offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said , he appreciate Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; a huge figh@@ ter , &quot; and he may possibly take part in his Saturday struggle . &quot;
&quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko was held with a generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he think the triple champion from River@@ side see &quot; very slowly , sorry . Mik@@ ey ... you really test the Ko @-@ Off . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said , the focus be , stroke will show , then boxes . &quot;
&quot; both they said , they could feel the Mom@@ entum , which he built for their own battle . &quot;
&quot; this is the battle , which has to be done . &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko said : &quot; I have wa@@ ited on the Top @-@ fighters and that is Mik@@ ey .
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four wo@@ unded by tire @-@ dro@@ ught
at an accident on the A7 on Thursday afternoon four people were killed in the part .
&quot; after the first information lost the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira against 4.@@ 30 , shortly before the junction market , pres@@ um@@ ably after a tire @-@ term control of his vehicle . &quot;
the car dot@@ ted to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment where he abo@@ unded and then remained on the roof in the green stri@@ pe .
the four ins@@ ets - two adults and two children - were heavily in@@ ju@@ red during the accident .
&quot; during the initial supply of the past due to the b@@ ail@@ out service , the A7 was locked in the north for about an hour , then the traffic on the left lanes can be passing through to the wrong place . &quot;
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; Dre@@ ams is better &quot;
&quot; Andre Hoffmann ho@@ vering after 2 : 2 for the season against Braunschweig , that the optimization of the def@@ ences in Au@@ e points will bring points . &quot;
&quot; for the first season was Andre Hoffmann , with the result , would not be the two oppos@@ ites at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; these were two oppos@@ ing too much , and we must fit even better in Au@@ e , &quot; says the def@@ enses of Fortuna Düsseldorf . &quot;
in the Ore Mountains the Dre@@ ams chain is to be further optimized .
&quot; and a gate after an open , the For@@ tun@@ es wish to be no longer included . &quot;
&quot; for the future it will be so that no more besides Michael ( R@@ ensing ) presents itself to the line . &quot;
&quot; Hoffmann is convinced that his team also gets better in preparation with the Dre@@ ams chain , than with the quad@@ rup@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; still I do not know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his coach Fried@@ hel@@ m Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is in his thing for sure , because we just have just built in the barrel of KA@@ AN Ay@@ han and N@@ iko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build well , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; the requirement is , however , that we are even better harmon@@ ise and we do not afford so many fail@@ ures . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann drives to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; but whether one cannot speak of a mis@@ erable starting from a mis@@ erable start , don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could be quite okay , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; if we can stand on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the po@@ ise , we will certainly speak of a decent end @-@ season . &quot;
of that his trainer wanted nothing to know .
&quot; the start into the season I &apos;m only after six to eight days , &quot; said Fried@@ hel@@ m Funk@@ el who wants not to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be broken pre@@ mat@@ urely because of an un@@ wet@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; now they can begin with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , that the player from Au@@ e may even be something fresh , since they could have no he@@ avier and complete game like Fortuna against a climb of f@@ ishers in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they do not know so 100 @-@ process where they are currently standing , &quot; says the inner def@@ enders of the Fortuna . &quot;
while guests from the Rhin@@ eland as an easier favorite on Sunday in the meeting at the end ( almost ) the stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; that we take them away , only because we are entitled to come under the first six , b@@ loc@@ ty , says Funk@@ el , whose balance is very positive in only a defeat against Au@@ e out of nine games . &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga which one has to beat from the beginning , &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as Ch@@ ef@@ er . &quot;
&quot; such a statement would be to meet arro@@ gan@@ t and elev@@ ating . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el will not want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish asylum seek@@ ers released
&quot; the latest results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden who have been under@@ gone to a new method for the medical evaluation of their age , show that more than 80 percent of those individuals were older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish Authority of For@@ ensi@@ c medicine ( Rä@@ tt@@ sm@@ e@@ dic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) began to carry out tests last year .
&quot; they are to be more accurately during the asylum process , after the Swedish mig@@ rant Authority ( Mig@@ rations ) because of errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees was critic@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; until today , Mig@@ rations shortened 6.@@ 880 to test cases and the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency has now published the results of 2,@@ 481 tests from the period in mid March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
&quot; eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were judged 18 or older , while in other 25 cases the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency asked that the person &quot; may be 18 years or older . &quot;
in 432 cases the conclusion that the person is under 18 years old .
tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is ques@@ tioned .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency , the results are resistant to the past few months . &quot;
&quot; we do not see great difference in statistics of past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot;
&quot; the high proportion of cases in which the person has been assessed as over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ ers has b@@ ent over his age . &quot;
&quot; in May , the agency released the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases to suggest that the oppressed person has been 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; as the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bl@@ a@@ det released the 5@@ 81 published results , she asked that in 243 of these cases the person had said that they will be 18 years old this year . &quot;
&quot; the method of the medical age assessment , made in the X @-@ ray imaging of white @-@ teeth and MR@@ T @-@ recordings of knee joints , which then be analysed by dentists and radi@@ ologist , was also cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a scan@@ tic is the En@@ do@@ kr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus at the Kar@@ ol@@ inska Institute , whose work includes the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see whether it was sooner or later than usual by pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I do not believe that the type of measurement should be used . &quot;
assess the biological age in this way is very insec@@ ure .
&quot; if we cannot say it certainly we should not do as if we could , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of tests : &quot; in general you can say that risk to judge a child as an adult . &quot;
&quot; the biggest risk lies in it when the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in the plan
the work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg come well .
&quot; on Wednesday , a seven tonnes was installed on the bridge at the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; we are very good at the time , it runs super , &quot; says Rein@@ hold L@@ esser , Bau@@ lad@@ der in the department of street and traffic in the government of the Secretary of Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April the works began at all three sanitary bridges , between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
the building is planned for October and E@@ asi@@ ly is certain that the schedule is respected .
&quot; the first bridge , from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads through the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is a v@@ ault bridge made of concrete , which is bo@@ died with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4,@@ 80 meters . &quot;
built in 1900 .
&quot; as the two other bridges , it has now been in the years now . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure the stability and traffic safety , the three components are now thoroughly re@@ constructed . &quot;
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built in red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , and 10,@@ 60 metres long . &quot;
&quot; the bridge at the outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach , on the north side of Lau@@ ter@@ bach , on the north side a 1,30 meters wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called fr@@ ing@@ board . &quot;
this is a side mounting that is also used as a run@@ way .
on the southern part of the bridge the bridge is scheduled to be used for a few metres wide br@@ ück@@ els .
then we shall go away the pedestrian streets .
&quot; the special thing is that it is about manufacturing parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges are already provided with the patented lo@@ gs .
particular finger@@ tips has to be achieved by the lines made by the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; there is also a glass cable , connected to which many companies are connected . &quot;
the residents were informed about the project in advance of the works .
&quot; furthermore , first of all the fish and can@@ cers had to be de@@ pl@@ eted . &quot;
for the bridges between the building building and the recept@@ acle in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg the traffic is regulated by a traffic light .
&quot; for construction work at the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bacher local entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the altitude of the hotels &quot; &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; &quot; is locked . &quot;
the cost of the three lo@@ gs are together 700 000 Euro .
financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ under protest in german pot@@ ato salad
&quot; it is not so frequent before that parties go on a Str@@ ang , but if it comes to an alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , which is only difficult among one hat . &quot;
&quot; the parties ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Left ) belong to a broad alliance that shows in this day peaceful flag , because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle Ron@@ del invites you to the big election campaign . &quot;
&quot; and known names to the start - as Alice Wei@@ del , formed together with Alexander Gau@@ land , the top @-@ board for the Bundestag on 24 September , and the Deputy Chair of Stor@@ k . &quot;
&quot; but those who are already on site at the beginning of the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ collectors , but demonstrate . &quot;
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colourful . &quot;
&quot; originally the town was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the fountain square , but now takes place on the parking lot below the Ron@@ d@@ ells - and therefore directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle . &quot;
a colorful picture that is here .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chair of the Forum A World and one of the author@@ itative organizers , really happy : &quot; great , as many people here come together . &quot;
&quot; there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; German pot@@ ato salad &quot; , &quot; which could also eat the Af@@ D without any problem , &quot; says the woman who brought him . &quot;
&quot; the police has moved many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence above all also at the railway station , which is only a few meters from the venues . &quot;
how is the Af@@ D actually got on Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes of the Af@@ D volcan@@ ic @-@ cube reported that he tries to strive for such an event and get the surcharge .
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a ref@@ us@@ ation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes not have enough parking spaces available . &quot;
&quot; so the Ron@@ del , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot;
&quot; overlooking the event on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ vor@@ platz , he says : &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; this is doing it : against 8 p.m. on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ vor@@ platz , a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle various speakers , including the Rh@@ en@@ land @-@ pf@@ alz Af@@ D @-@ chair Uwe boy . &quot;
&quot; in the hall are about 200 list@@ ener , who wait for it that the Sh@@ enk@@ andi@@ da@@ tin for the Bundestag , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Deputy Chair of Stor@@ k hold its speeches . &quot;
&quot; unchanged is the police presented , but so far the officials had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; a little more than an hour takes the Af@@ D event , the guests on the court have a longer breath , but also there is short after 21 o &apos;clock . &quot;
the police can leave - not special precau@@ tions .
tromb@@ one meets trumpet
&quot; a re @-@ hear with the Wolf@@ acher tromb@@ on@@ ists Freder@@ ic Bell@@ i there are in the series of Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ neu@@ te tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 pm in the monastery . &quot;
&quot; together with the Bulgarian trumpets Miro@@ slav Pet@@ kov he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea , &quot; or even &quot; balconies &quot; , &quot; meets a classical German training with roots in the bladder music . &quot;
both sol@@ o@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have subscri@@ bers to European se@@ ab@@ ed priests .
so Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ ed at the prestigious Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic Bell@@ i is Sol@@ op@@ os@@ aun@@ ts the SWR Symphony Orchestra .
&quot; both unite the desire to cross the borders on their instruments , but also to merge the limits of the different gen@@ res . &quot;
&quot; this sounds Johann Sebastian Bach with the two like in a new tissue , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; World Music &quot; &quot; combines with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the J@@ azz@@ ech@@ op@@ aque N@@ ils W@@ og@@ ram , mix classical , jazz and free games to an intrigu@@ ing overall treasure . &quot;
this core part of the program was performed only this spring with a huge success in Freiburg .
the prestigious composer N@@ ils W@@ og@@ ram has written it for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ kirche with their special acou@@ sti@@ cs will be conscious of the concert with included .
crime Stew@@ art talks about their bis@@ ex@@ ual ality
&quot; some people gr@@ illed cheese , and will eat him up to the end of their lives . &quot;
&quot; but I want to try everything out , so cri@@ tically st@@ ew@@ art quite openly about their bis@@ ex@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; when I get in gr@@ illed cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what is coming than next ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the most well @-@ known relationship of the Holl@@ y@@ wood@@ stars was the one to her &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; &quot; colleagues Robert Patt@@ aya which eventually went bitter . &quot;
&quot; despite this in@@ sured the br@@ ün@@ ette Dar@@ stell@@ a towards the &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; I was in everyone seriously susp@@ ected that I ge@@ dat@@ et . &quot;
&quot; or believe her about , I would have played it ? &quot;
&quot; after their separation there was critics , that she was bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; I have always lived in du@@ alism and seriously believed . &quot;
so it has never been confused or disabled .
&quot; I just liked it to be taken seriously , not serious . &quot;
&quot; especially among them they suffered &quot; &quot; Bang Show &quot; &quot; but in the school@@ ing , as they rather prefer like a bu@@ b &quot; , &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
this really has been very in@@ ju@@ red .
&quot; when I eleven was told me the children , I would look like a bu@@ b . &quot;
I felt really attacked and ashamed and ashamed .
now I look back and think to me : &apos; girl &apos; be proud of you ! &apos; .
&quot; especially the public she doesn &apos;t like to live her love , &quot; &quot; people expect you in a certain way , and the anno@@ yed me . &quot;
&quot; and perhaps I call me a number of und@@ ank@@ bar , but I don &apos;t like it to be justified before all the public . &quot;
the govern@@ or of West Virginia pre@@ aches to that he changes the party
&quot; the democratic govern@@ or of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced on Thursday at a demonstration with President Tru@@ mp that he will change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have become away from me , &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot;
today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of re@@ thinking ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia . I can no longer help you when I am a democratic govern@@ or .
the r@@ ally broke out in che@@ ers .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the rep@@ ublic@@ ans , added Justice . &quot;
&quot; as a trainer , I would say that it is at the time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp spoke previously a big announcement at West Virginia Rally .
Mr. Tru@@ mp won Western Virginia with 42 points and Justice not endor@@ sed the democratic candidate Hill@@ ary Clinton .
Justice who is according to For@@ bes of the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the State was elected 2016 .
&quot; For@@ bes is firm that he possesses coal in five states , and has inherited a carbon business from his father . &quot;
it is worth 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
&quot; in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee on Thurs@@ days gave an explanation , in which it said : &quot; &quot; the Party change from Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic party which would seem to be more likely to do in order to make our land again great . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 Gou@@ vern@@ ements and the control of the least legislative activity in history is the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice only the last rejection of a party which is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive , introductory message , &quot; said the R@@ NC @-@ president R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation den CB@@ S News . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; honest &quot; &quot; Russian exc@@ use for mental scan@@ dal &quot;
&quot; the global leader of the ath@@ le@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , pra@@ ised on Thursday , what he described as an apparent exc@@ use from Russia to a mental scan@@ dal , but he re@@ peti@@ tive , it is not the moment for the country to be recorded in sport . &quot;
Russia Ath@@ le@@ tics @-@ boss D@@ mit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ tin was said during the I@@ A@@ AF Congress on the eve of the ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country was correct from the sport and that he decided to fight the mental doping .
&quot; he said , I are sorry for &quot; all athletes , of which were washed with competitions , gold and silver medals . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments the I@@ A@@ AF Congress for the maintenance of the Forbidden , which was held in November 2015 , after a report of the World @-@ Anti @-@ Doping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open response today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said I@@ A@@ AF @-@ President Co@@ e the Repor@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; the whole Council and the entire congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has recognized itself , that they have experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation will be re@@ designed . &quot;
&quot; Co@@ e said , he also was &quot; pleased , &quot; that Russia has accepted the criteria for its re @-@ launch . &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been made , but the congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation .
&quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the dep@@ ra@@ ved system , he added . &quot;
nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes are beginning with the ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships which begin on Friday in London according to the strict I@@ A@@ AF criteria as neutr@@ ale actors .
&quot; the leader of the I@@ A@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia should meet some of the criteria for re@@ adjustment . &quot;
&quot; Dro@@ gent@@ tests are still inadequate and Forbidden trainers are still free to operate , he told re@@ por@@ ters in London after a talk at the I@@ A@@ AF Council . &quot;
Trau@@ er@@ akt for in Mali had cr@@ ashed soldiers
at a dream party in the nor@@ h@@ ess@@ ian Fr@@ itz@@ lar have thought around 1000 people of the two at a hel@@ icopter in Mali Um@@ bre@@ wers soldiers .
the ceremony took place on Thursday at the Dom@@ stadt under high security arrangements .
&quot; to the still un@@ clari@@ fied crash , Ursula von der Ley@@ en ( CD@@ U ) nothing . &quot;
&quot; they called the two surveys , but as &quot; &quot; being able of their specialist . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we tend to be of this highest victim , which they her@@ ed in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ year Major and the 47 @-@ year Stab@@ sh@@ au@@ pt@@ mann came from Nord@@ h@@ essen on Wednesday before a week in the West African Mali .
their s@@ är@@ ge were transferred to Germany and were accompanied by a dead @-@ guard of the Bundes@@ wehr in the Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er Dom St. Peter .
&quot; at noon , first only the relatives were in the church goodbye . &quot;
&quot; after that , the dream party began in the circle of the family , eng@@ ster friends , of representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr , as well as politics . &quot;
among them were also H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the General @-@ perspective of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
&quot; Trau@@ erg@@ ä@@ ste laid ro@@ ses , the relatives were arm in arm to the S@@ är@@ gen . &quot;
in front of the church Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; the Minister of Defense by the Ley@@ en , the Um@@ bre@@ en soldiers proved to be &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; and experienced . &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ au@@ pt@@ mann has been building the aircraft of the Kampf@@ h@@ ub@@ screw tiger in Fr@@ itz@@ lar with one of the first six trained tiger pilot of its reg@@ iment .
&quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , Com@@ man@@ de@@ ur of the reg@@ iment , to which the soldiers stated , said : &quot; &quot; when this occupation could not turn the crash , there would not have been ver@@ tically . &quot;
doubts about the UN Mission in Mali showed minister of the Ley@@ en not : the use was dangerous .
&quot; but he is also of high importance &quot; for a country , from which we are separated only through two states , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
after the grap@@ hen party the mur@@ ge were brought out of the cathedral .
&quot; when and where they become best@@ owed , the Bundes@@ wehr did not make any information . &quot;
Prinz Hen@@ rik wants no grave next to his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not m@@ apped his death next to his wife . &quot;
he shared the Royal House on Thursday with .
&quot; traditionally , the Danish King@@ doms of Ros@@ kil@@ de is buried . &quot;
the sculp@@ tor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ gaard was already submitted a coff@@ e@@ oph@@ ag for the two .
the Queen was dis@@ agree with the decision of its husband was it further in the notification .
&quot; where prince Hen@@ rik bury , is still un@@ clear . &quot;
&quot; but he did not have the intention , to be joined in his French homeland . &quot;
Prinz Hen@@ rik had never made a fl@@ our that he was not happy with his title .
after the throne of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he had become King .
&quot; 2016 he went into retirement , and also sets the title &quot; &quot; prin@@ cess &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; since Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not get the title and the function he wanted to see himself in comparison with his wife , and not after death , L@@ ene Ball@@ eby , the boss @-@ speaking of the Danish mountain house . &quot;
where the last retirement of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will eventually be un@@ clear .
&quot; but he did not have the intent to be joined in his French homeland , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the country for which he has worked for over the past 50 years .
&quot; the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French Adel@@ s@@ sex , had already met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London . &quot;
he worked at the Thames in the French Embassy .
&quot; during his later wife , the sympath@@ eth@@ ni@@ tions of the people has always fled , Joseph Hen@@ rik had a heavy duty in his almost 50 years old . &quot;
&quot; in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik over the first years in Denmark : &quot; few months after my arrival everything I did , cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was sw@@ elling , I preferred wine instead of beer , Sei@@ den@@ str@@ ur@@ fs instead of Stri@@ ck@@ so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia @-@ tobacco , and who had the reputation to be the soci@@ alists of soci@@ etal intellec@@ tu@@ als , I could not hope for indul@@ gence . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed happy with this position and not ashamed of it .
these were the same two errors ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants swift re@@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; defe@@ ats Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is after the loss of red @-@ green regul@@ arity for a rapid re@@ election of the country , but he does not want . &quot;
for the resolution of the Parliament spoke on Friday for the resolution of the Parliament .
&quot; previously , the surprising discharge of a Green Party had thrown into a serious crisis in Nieder@@ sachsen , the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) . &quot;
five months before the official date of the country @-@ election they lost the red green coalition in Hannover so that its cr@@ appe A @-@ vote majority in the Parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the previous Green @-@ MP El@@ ke T@@ emporary constituted its step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the election 2018 in its election in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ ü@@ m@@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; stated on Friday in Hanover . &quot;
CD@@ U @-@ fac@@ tional Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend its fac@@ tion to its fac@@ tion .
&quot; thus CD@@ U and F@@ DP had to have 69 seats in Lower Saxony , SPD and Green 68 seats . &quot;
so far the ratio was revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag will be elected on 14 January coming year .
&quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said , the red @-@ green government has now decided whether to rule them in this situation without majority . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l does however , however , is essential for non @-@ essential that the country @-@ tag decides as rapidly as its self @-@ resolution . &quot;
the CD@@ U @-@ Group is expected to decide on their own action on Tuesday .
the provincial version also sees the possibility that the country @-@ day the prime minister moves the confidence and sel@@ ects a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; our constitution offers several options . &quot;
&quot; these options have to be made legally clean , &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; one will discuss all the questions , if they are legally un@@ reasonable . &quot;
&quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler n@@ amed T@@ we@@ ens step &quot; &quot; but slightly cur@@ i@@ os . &quot;
the politicians himself stressed : &quot; I am not ob@@ li@@ que .
I feel very good . &quot;
it turned out to be a trailer in black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called the Ab@@ dul@@ ent members of the return of their country convention .
&quot; we of course , of course , that they received their country @-@ day , which has obtained through the green country list , with immediate effect , distributed the provincial met@@ a Jans@@ sen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
the Group Leader of the Green Anja P@@ iel said : &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ rich@@ ly . &quot;
they deliber@@ ately decided to lead no pron@@ unci@@ ation in the group .
&quot; also against the background , there were no content differences , we cannot grasp this step . &quot;
SPD pul@@ ch@@ anc@@ andi@@ sers Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the remains of the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on MEPs El@@ ke T@@ west to the CD@@ U as a bet@@ ray@@ al .
&quot; the behavior of the former Gre@@ ens MPs in Lower Saxony is not only ad@@ rat to the voters and voters , but also bet@@ ray@@ al on red green , &quot; wrote the President of the Socialists and Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot;
&quot; he support the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , which will quickly choose the country &apos;s day . &quot;
the Austr@@ o @-@ West costs Red @-@ Green in Nieder@@ sachsen the majority .
&quot; the politicians &quot; &quot; in her last van@@ ity and in her fru@@ stration , their personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed SPD @-@ Secretary General of Hu@@ ber@@ tus salvation . &quot;
it is a scan@@ dal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony this dirty inc@@ ub@@ ine play and tries to beat out political capital .
&quot; defe@@ ated CD@@ U @-@ fac@@ tional Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend its members , El@@ ke T@@ ort in the CD@@ U . &quot;
&quot; the SPD member of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , cast T@@ ev@@ ax@@ ing to fal@@ si@@ fy the outcome of the country @-@ election 2013 . &quot;
&quot; at that time the CD@@ U was at that time before the SPD &apos;s strongest force , SPD and Green had in the country @-@ day but a household th@@ inner majority of one voice . &quot;
&quot; agricultural affairs in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from gyp@@ sum , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany disc@@ usses about embarrass@@ ed Eg@@ gs .
how could the scan@@ dal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
Land@@ economic ini@@ ster Christian Schmidt ( C@@ SU ) stands in the interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr Schmidt , How can consumers protect against po@@ ison@@ ed eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumer within and encourage the eggs in your refrigerator to view and check the stamp pressure .
on the consumer portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de the Bundesländer represent the latest information on the affected egg @-@ Char@@ gen .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if after all we currently know , a health haz@@ ard is virtually eliminated . &quot;
&quot; now Al@@ di now takes the best possible crisis in crisis - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the clari@@ fier of the Bundes@@ land@@ lords were not really perceived ? &quot;
food monitoring is the task of the Bundesländer .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has immediately been switched on and is on the acquain@@ tance of Germany in close exchange with the authorities of the countries . &quot;
all information and Risk Assessment are available to consumers .
trade has just as important as the manufacturers to carry out concern that the products sold @-@ selling products and health are in@@ conceivable .
&quot; if at the case of the return content of 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg , these are not transfer@@ able . &quot;
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time does not include the operations to blame .
sit and consumers in the same boat ?
&quot; after the same time , the production company meets no direct fault . &quot;
&quot; rather , they must count on mut@@ ually illegal practices of service companies with economic damage . &quot;
as always there is little contro@@ l@@ ure in the harvest .
is it only missing on the staff or on the encrypted jurisdiction ?
&quot; however , it was just the official controls that have been revealed the process . &quot;
&quot; however , the truth is also that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded from 100 percent . &quot;
&quot; especially therefore , a consequ@@ ent enlightenment of such events and hand@@ over to the prosec@@ ut@@ or in the cases where criminal off@@ ences are held , of decisive importance . &quot;
I have already made several times that I expect a complete explanation of the responsible public authorities .
is the regular al@@ ar@@ mis@@ m in food sc@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
consumers and consumers have the right to get exclusively safe and convenient food .
if a non @-@ approved ins@@ ecti@@ cide use in the food industry are consumer rights and consumer rights .
&quot; due to the folded means , manufacturers , traders and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
basically must be clear : the illegal use of the ins@@ ecti@@ cides Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of living @-@ animals is not acceptable and must be termin@@ ated immediately .
it must be consistent with high pressure on all levels .
&quot; I expect from all the competent authorities , that the facts will be re@@ ared and clari@@ fied . &quot;
how the Financial rules of Football to N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s moved to Paris
&quot; the rules that aim to prevent tremendous issues of European foot@@ ball@@ ers , N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Wel@@ tre@@ k@@ ord transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain . &quot;
&quot; any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Germain by the UEF@@ A , as the executive organization that over@@ sees the European game has control the power , cre@@ ws from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial fair @-@ play rules , which was launched by the UEF@@ A , mean that PS@@ G eventually needs to prove that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million $ ) to buy the Brazi@@ li@@ ans from his contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a sal@@ ary that will be several ten million dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s moving to France .
&quot; PS@@ G can make sure that N@@ ey@@ mar underlined and bring it into a gal@@ axy of other stars , given the funding of the team by the energy of rich mi@@ tig@@ ate family of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; to apply for the purchase of players a lot of money , but they must be controlled with legitimate audi@@ ences , which allow them to store the break @-@ E@@ ven point in relation to the football @-@ related business . &quot;
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini following his election to the UEF@@ A president in 2007 .
&quot; the former French player believed that Ver@@ eine , who had taken enormous debt in their quest for success , effectively che@@ ating and ris@@ ed to ruin , if banks or owners re@@ ared their support . &quot;
in 2011 FF@@ P sur@@ rendered to the debts of the clubs for monitoring their losses .
&quot; the change meant that the model model , the novel Abr@@ am@@ ovi@@ ch was originally used in Chelsea - a club with potential and then strong investment in order to build the team and build a global brand - to a harder issue . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year @-@ year period period , which runs until 2018 , you can accept losses in the amount of EUR 30 million . &quot;
&quot; and although Plat@@ ini is fallen from the presidency in the Un@@ gn@@ ade , its UEF@@ A successor Alek@@ s@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to get rid of excessive spending . &quot;
&quot; certainly , FF@@ P is not dead and we will step up the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared with The Associ@@ ated Press in the past week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G buy the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a p@@ Code , it can distribute the amount for accounting for the duration of his contract . &quot;
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract for the next five years in the amount of 44,@@ 4 million euros in the annual financial transaction .
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has met the PS@@ G along with Abu Dhabi , owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G received a reduction of € 60 million ( then 82 million dollars ) which later became reduced to 20 million euros , and it has been arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 player remains limited . &quot;
&quot; UEF@@ A is looking for clubs which could try to over@@ see their financial view , adding their revenue by companies that are associated with owners of a club . &quot;
&quot; while a Catalan company could be spon@@ ge when the value of sponsorship should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not apply this as legitimate income . &quot;
&quot; exactly this happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the sponsorship of P@@ SA was stopped by the Qatar Tourism Authority . &quot;
it was reported that a part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar over payments of the World Cup 2006 in Qatar could come in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar have fought that N@@ ey@@ mar World &apos;s amb@@ assador will only be able to find out of such maneu@@ ver for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A must still be attentive to consider every attempt to handle the rules .
&quot; UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s transfer , sag@@ tem on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation . &quot;
they talked about the condition of anon@@ ym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press as they were not authorized to discuss the PS@@ G &apos;s situation .
&quot; the last published reports indicate that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 with a turnover of 54@@ 2,@@ 4 million euros has achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros . &quot;
accounts for the last fiscal year must be published .
PS@@ G expects that N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrive a blessing on sponsor@@ ing @-@ De@@ als , merch@@ an@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot@@ ics . &quot;
the association is assum@@ ing that sales will increase by at least 30 percent by the signing of the signature .
&quot; the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated , one of the best football players to see , and tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Weg@@ ade by preventing it , that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial doping &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the President of the La League , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish Daily AS with regard to Qatar . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger whose association is owned by the American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La League against a state who is funded by the association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the owner and that has changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it will be very difficult to respect the finance Fair@@ play , because we have different ways or have different interests when one country has such a major player to represent a country . &quot;

nostal@@ gia goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
&quot; this re@@ petition of history is both the nostal@@ g@@ ically due to the glorious days of characters of the 80 @-@ year @-@ years , for the 90 @-@ year @-@ Gr@@ unge @-@ era ( as the pre@@ den@@ ker David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ old the Sk@@ etch @-@ Com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV@@ s ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth Banks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to greater things . &quot;
&quot; as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ ody and an em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era permanent memories . &quot;
&quot; but as fran@@ chise it feels , then the time would be . &quot;
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked out surprisingly well , not only because of his absurd hum@@ ors ( it included a original story for a speaking di@@ lig@@ ent vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;
&quot; by playing on the core of the day - actors in middle ages , we@@ dges play children , they are growing - they still got the im@@ possibility to win the last part of the wine . &quot;
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with its adults who now play adults is less emotion@@ ally hardened and its par@@ ody goes more according to the wat@@ ering principle , including a reef to the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ er years as &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cr@@ adle &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; at a point closes a character by a Apple @-@ Power@@ book , some in@@ line sk@@ ates and a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the ami@@ able Coop ( Mr. Show@@ old ) , now Rom@@ aut@@ or , has K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mo@@ reau ) still not forgotten . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost its vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy guy mal@@ ign@@ ant P@@ lot which is involved in the Ronald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ old ) now that is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always the lessons are the best part of fran@@ chise .
&quot; it makes great fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , the Matt D@@ illons Unter@@ li@@ ppen@@ bart from &quot; singles , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp is now like an old K@@ erk@@ er . &quot;
&quot; these are the moments random mad@@ ness , which could show this fran@@ chise as a kind of re@@ peti@@ tive &quot; &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series , until he achieved what I will show as his logical conclusion : &quot; &quot; WE@@ T Hot American Summer : twenty Years L@@ ater , &quot; which will show the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; at Amazon now re@@ members a different kind of nostal@@ gia : to the revival of the Cold War by &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even an &quot; G@@ low &quot; with its East @-@ West @-@ West Ring @-@ IK@@ ON@@ O@@ GRA@@ PH@@ IE . &quot;
&quot; the com@@ edy held by Brian Gat@@ ewood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka made com@@ edy with Rh@@ ys Thomas as director gives an entire TV series , with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , who fight for truth , A@@ the@@ ism and the way of Marxism . &quot;
the main tro@@ ugh - a hard @-@ known Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ si@@ c J@@ R. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , their dial@@ ogs from Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a exec@@ utable producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt will be synchron@@ ized in English .
it is an in@@ geni@@ ous idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice walks to watch ( the police sp@@ ends the time to look at chess on TV as Americans may do with football ) .
&quot; and the list of the famous speakers - including Jenny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ erman , Mah@@ ersh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - ensures a decent game &apos; Fin@@ de &apos; voice out . &quot;
&quot; but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is thus committed to the tru@@ thful propaganda dram@@ as - a mur@@ derer who carries a Re@@ ag@@ an mask , is involved - that it is often like a single one . &quot;
&quot; in six long episode it takes up , and the com@@ edy is not fast or often enough . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; which was placed on a lower length , his Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p @-@ S@@ ati@@ re could deliver better , since Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef ever visit the American message , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who swal@@ lowed up a he@@ ap of Hamburg . &quot;
the message for the imag@@ ined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything to the for@@ age for a money .
the fic@@ tional Romanian creator are not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and with its own history .
blow against drugs @-@ Maf@@ ia in the country
the police is a blow against the Italian m@@ af@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; at the Mit@@ tw@@ och@@ re tomorrow , in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ B@@ aar circle , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Konstanz , Friedrich@@ shafen and Stuttgart has passed numerous objects as the prosec@@ ution of Con@@ stance on Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; at the age of 25 , 15 acc@@ used to be fixed at the age of 25 years and 77 years and have already taken their ar@@ rest warran@@ t . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the officials provided greater quantities of mari@@ juana and coconut , fire@@ arms as well as several hundreds of hundreds of thousands . &quot;
at the time of the same swe@@ eps in Italy two persons were arrested .
against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans there were German ar@@ rest warran@@ t .
the two will therefore be pres@@ um@@ ably delivered to Germany .
at the action the Italian and Bay@@ erische investig@@ ators participated .
&quot; in total , more than 300 polic@@ emen were in use . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Maf@@ ia will be organised drugs , heavy violence , tried out murder and rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mailing . &quot;
&quot; already since summer 2016 , the prosec@@ ution of Con@@ stance against organised drug trading in the South German region . &quot;
&quot; between the prosec@@ ution in Con@@ stance and Palermo , a real exchange and the investig@@ ator of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the grand@@ use at the Mit@@ tw@@ och@@ tomorrow was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo . &quot;
&quot; in the spot@@ light of the investigations , above all Italian nationality with regard to the Italian m@@ af@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; even an incident took place on 27 May in Hü@@ fingen in the early morning several shots in a guest house , is likely to go to the bank account of Ban@@ de . &quot;
another big gaps in the fore@@ igner ( s )
data from citizens who should not arise . this report is that the fore@@ igner Register in Germany indicates significant defects .
leading to partly gra@@ ving mis@@ decisions in asylum procedures .
&quot; the Federal Government for the refuge@@ e management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen manner , has taken attention to a media report at large gaps in the Aus@@ län@@ der@@ cent@@ ric register . &quot;
&quot; defects in the registered data could lead to asylum procedure and deport@@ ations &quot; to partly gra@@ ving mis@@ decisions , &quot; in an analysis that &apos;s the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the register , the data is estimated to ten million people with foreign nation@@ als , including about 5,@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU states . &quot;
the data are therefore managed according to approximately 600 pay@@ ers authorities in Germany .
&quot; because the data have not been sufficiently maintained , the data quality in parts has not been well done . &quot;
&quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 were found , &quot; by people who have long been no longer alive , or by citizens who have become German citizens and actually should no longer arise . &quot;
&quot; incorrect data entry can greatly slow@@ down irre@@ ver@@ sible processes , &quot; says it to the report further . &quot;
&quot; in statistics of exceptional people , those EU citizens are over @-@ citizens who do not have to travel at all . &quot;
&quot; but such false stat@@ uses led &quot; &quot; to a distor@@ ted debate on how to deal with a trav@@ eller , &quot; it is therefore in the analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the government has apparently begun to return refuge@@ e families with 16 @-@ year children back to Italy if they travelled from there . &quot;
&quot; this is going out of an internal paper of the Federal Minister for Migration and refugees ( BAM@@ F ) , reports the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ re@@ er Zeitung &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the paper , it means the BAM@@ F leader such procedures &quot; for families with children - except for inf@@ ants and to@@ dd@@ lers , after Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 it was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper among reference to the difficult situation on site . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin agreement for refugees from the EU state it is responsible for refugees . &quot;
&quot; if a mig@@ rant travels to another EU country , this state can withdraw him into the entry . &quot;
&quot; in order to substanti@@ ate the office now , &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the entrance capacity for families with min@@ ors children in Italy has increased significantly . &quot;
Italy made up for the recording and accommodation of families warran@@ ties .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EC@@ rt@@ HR ) keep these commitments for sufficient .
other EU countries would also send refugees during the Dublin agreement .
&quot; the inner political speaker of the lens action in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed this decision : &quot; &quot; families with children , due to the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system , and an haz@@ ard of the child . &quot;

this is how three people can benefit from a blood circulation .
&quot; at the same time , Ma@@ isen@@ bacher reported from the actions that are carried out in the spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; this year we achieved with 114 spins , the second best result , &quot; said the DR@@ C circular team . &quot;

the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25 %
&quot; the Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates are unchanged , after the weak economic growth and weak@@ ening of inflation have shr@@ inking over a rise . &quot;
&quot; the Bank of England has war@@ ned that economic growth &quot; &quot; y@@ ields &quot; &quot; will remain , when they with@@ held the interest rates on a family in the middle of a strengthened pressure . &quot;
&quot; the policy decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 that interest rates on 0.25 % , whereby in this month less members have an increase , since the weak economic growth has increased support for a raise . &quot;
&quot; in their quarterly assessment , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 7 % and for 2018 to 1.6 % and war@@ ned that the pressure on the household income would continue , whereby inflation in autumn is expected to rise in just under 3 % . &quot;
&quot; but it sign@@ alized that in the next few years , they would be necessary to grow by the Bre@@ x@@ ite inflation and she said that the credit cost may rise more than expected on the financial markets . &quot;
&quot; the members also agreed to withdraw a part of the mam@@ mot@@ h jun@@ c@@ ture , which was issued before a year after the Bre@@ x@@ it . &quot;
&quot; it will be time to provide time for the funding plan to provide financial resources for banks , despite being said that they will now be expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds Ster@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; minutes after deciding on interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central progn@@ osis of the M@@ PC , the gross domestic product remains weak as the pressure on the real income of households will continue to use the consumption . &quot;
&quot; interest rates re@@ peti@@ tive it that &quot; &quot; degree of monetary policy &quot; &quot; would be necessary for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; &quot; greater greater &quot; dimension , &quot; as the markets expect . &quot;
the markets forecasts up the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; however , the Bank stressed that increases &quot; gradual &quot; and &quot; limited &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the growth forecasts for this and next year are projected in comparison to the 1.@@ 9 % in May 2005 and 1.9 % .
it has forecast its growth forecasts up to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the Po@@ und fell according to these messages towards the dollar and the euro .
the pounds fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.3 % to 1.11 Euros .
&quot; the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ appoint@@ ing growth figures have increased the rising expectations on a set of advertising and increase GDP in the second quarter of 0,@@ 2 % in the previous three months . &quot;
&quot; growth is expected to recover in the third quarter , although it is easy to recover by the bank at the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the recent inspiration report offered little enthusiasm for households , who will be affected by an increasing inflation and reduced mobility , since the shar@@ pen@@ ing is first even worse before they get better . &quot;
&quot; it added that monetary policy can not prevent the income in the coming years , but they added that wages began to recover from the end of its three @-@ year growth . &quot;
&quot; the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is attribut@@ able to the weak pounds , which will compens@@ ate for some of the lower consumer goods . &quot;
&quot; the decision is a year after lowering interest rates on 0.25 % in the last August after the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ king of the fun@@ du@@ des . &quot;
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will achieve prices and economy .
&quot; prior to the final Judgment of the Bank to the interest rates , the call was increased after a set of interest , since the inflation increased pressure on hard earned households , with three political decision makers in July for an increase in 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; inflation has declined from 2,@@ 9 % in June to 2.9 % , although the bank said that this has been expected and will be re @-@ going back in the coming months . &quot;
&quot; the Bank said , the exce@@ eding in relation to their goal of 2 % is to be a &quot; &quot; weak l@@ b &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Co@@ reco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; given the recent return of the s@@ wap market , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive , since the credit@@ ors would like to search for shops and end the year in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market looks particularly good for those who run the existing de@@ as and complete the new mort@@ gage , and many with free @-@ free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) is supposed to be for@@ ci@@ ful HIV @-@ Dro@@ ge 10.000 people
patients will be obtained from September after a fight before the High Court against the financing of the drug in the N@@ HS Access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV infection treatment .
N@@ HS England announced that one prior to intercourse is proph@@ yla@@ xis proph@@ yla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) that may reduce the Inf@@ ection risk by around 86 percent , now from healthcare service to a first three @-@ annual study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he declared himself to finance the process after the Ap@@ pe@@ al Constitu@@ tional Court announced last year a jud@@ gement of the Supreme Court of Justice , that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it . &quot;
&quot; the release announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England Chief Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; important new intervention , &quot; while the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) this as &quot; decisive moment &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health hospitals in London , Brigh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be the first to allow the registration of people and other clinics will follow in October , before it will be introduced in the whole of April 2018 . &quot;
proph@@ yl@@ ing proph@@ yla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV medicines that will be taken before sex to reduce the risk of an HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces HIV infection in inf@@ ecting endangered types .
pre@@ p before sexual intercourse means that straight enough medicines will present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such drugs may be taken every day or so two hours before intercourse .
&quot; those who are involved in the treatment , are pregnant or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexual and people with HIV @-@ positive partners who were not treated successfully . &quot;
&quot; clinics are identified to the participants identified by the study , including males , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status will not be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment . &quot;
&quot; people who live in England and registered at a medical practitioner , can also opt for a possible participation in their local sex clinic . &quot;
the program gets £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for the delivery of medicines that week after an international competitive procurement .
&quot; the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p , which can be implemented in a large scale , as it is used in a large scale . &quot;
&quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said , &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts for prevention of HIV and over@@ hau@@ l . &quot;
it is another milestone in which over three decades of sustained progress in addressing one of the biggest health challenges of humanity . &quot;
Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) said : &quot; this is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ p , if it is specifically aimed at vulnerable and vulnerable people , the possibility to change the English HIV epide@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; from September to people with high HIV risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England , to develop a new instrument that is truly controlled and is not subject to a negotiation with a partner , which leads to improving many , many lives . &quot;
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , CEO of Terror Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; the priority must now lie that the study is rapidly conducted throughout the country and that no one who has left a risk for HIV . &quot;
&quot; now since the pre@@ p test medicine has been made , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , shadow @-@ Health Minister , said : &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome to a month of delays and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation by the government welcome and over@@ due . &quot;
the evidence show how transformed this drug as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of these vital infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as fast as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV @-@ infected , and that it will contribute to promoting the dissemination of HIV in society . &quot;
the big living life : intermediate and cl@@ ever@@ e designer @-@ tricks have turned these small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a wide open home
&quot; Jo@@ anne L@@ eig@@ h , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , reduced in 2014 by a large house in K@@ nigh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court Apartment . &quot;
&quot; it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne was not packed and sold out . &quot;
&quot; before , I lived with my ex in K@@ nigh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; I sear@@ ched for something , that was comparable to my price . &quot;
&quot; I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and it had the same high ceilings . &quot;
I love me in love and made an offer on that day . &quot;
&quot; since the first visit , the 1.000 square kilometer has been completely rebuilt . &quot;
&quot; originally a bedroom property with a sp@@ ook@@ ed layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne &apos;s storage space and a mezzanine floor to optimally use the generous ceiling height . &quot;
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my requirement , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose she appointed the Architecture and Design@@ studio Duck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill , which was 12,@@ 5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the blank@@ et was not big enough to place two rooms to each other , so the architectural challenge consisted of creating a mezzanine floor in which one could stand . &quot;
Re@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively in order to release the release .
&quot; the steel works is rather complicated , &quot; explained . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they had over@@ thrown into each other , without having had to mos@@ quit@@ oes . &quot;
&quot; it was not just about to build a simple platform , but to create the steel so that he had the right height for the function above or below . &quot;
&quot; this arrangement makes it possible to place a fan , two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama . &quot;
for the mezzanine looks a classic cl@@ assy window from Retro@@ u@@ vi@@ us over the gl@@ am@@ orous living area .
&quot; mir@@ ro@@ sed gold furniture , sil@@ ently acc@@ ents and vintage ser@@ ge mou@@ ille illumination set the style for the program . &quot;
the use of mir@@ rors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
at both ends a short corri@@ dor is mir@@ ro@@ red to make him longer work .
in the kitchen the mir@@ rors feel like a window into another room .
at the entrance they sear@@ ched units place for all cut@@ ters and glasses of yo@@ anne .
&quot; due to the perception of a gl@@ am@@ orous space , the beauty of the living room can shut the kitchen , if it is not used . &quot;
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the Special at this is that it is a gar@@ ant@@ ness .
&quot; a bit of engineering was there , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the stainless steel , vene@@ ered M@@ DF door . &quot;
&quot; it is not very important , so when you sho@@ cked the door very easily . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the cl@@ ever@@ ly use of room and storage space , Jo@@ anne could gain extra 16 m ² , an extra bedroom and an improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the basic area - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate mak@@ ler will enter and perform a calculation based on the ground size . &quot;
&quot; here , they managed to enlarge the ground surface and at the same time use high quality materials used to get the room his luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things that you touch and which therefore help to create an emotional connection in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you do not love you into the electric plugs at the walls .
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
&quot; it shows that an apartment can be distinguished by good design and increased levels of square , from some by default in something very amazing . &quot;
&quot; in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave this not . &quot;
brothers fight for a 500 million US dollar real estate
&quot; two brothers are four decades , after their Italian family founded the Dyn@@ asty , in a meditation because of one of the biggest real estate imper@@ ative Vic@@ tori@@ as worth more than 500 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the Carl@@ ton Football @-@ Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their assets shall be split . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp argument about separation takes place in the Supreme Court of Justice . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the brothers 38 properties have collected the value of more than half a billion dollars , since the family 1973 a shop in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot;
&quot; there , the West@@ co Je@@ ans family founded and grew up to a chain of 160 retailers . &quot;
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
&quot; this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis includes now offices at the city centre , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs . &quot;
&quot; after an agreement with its de@@ ceased father Col@@ in - by Paul as &quot; &quot; main operator , and domin@@ ating personality &quot; &quot; in the family De Lu@@ tis - about two thirds of the enterprise &apos;s mind and Paul approximately one third . &quot;
jurisdiction that this means that Col@@ in Property is in the value of 316 million dollars and Paul in the value of 176 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has turned to us for Paul as issues .
&quot; the Col@@ in proposed resolutions have left him by leaving what I held for the best properties in 2015 , he wrote in 2015 in a first Aff@@ i@@ dav@@ it . &quot;
on Friday the first hearing of the Supreme Court was held .
&quot; the brothers now fight for control over the existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims to be excluded . &quot;
&quot; col@@ in arg@@ um@@ ented , this is not true , but thro@@ ws Paul before , some pos@@ sessions in@@ competent . &quot;
&quot; in an early monkey @-@ dav@@ it , that was submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hope to put the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my it@@ alian heritage wrote that the family is the most important priority , he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the costs rise in the case with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ i@@ dav@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports by companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading law@@ yers , including All@@ an My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and by both sides of the law firm . &quot;
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her de@@ ceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who run milk bars and Del@@ ik@@ at@@ ess@@ en@@ gers in late 1950 @-@ years and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick .
&quot; they used the safety to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood @-@ property , in which Col@@ in the first Je@@ ans@@ load of the family opened . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in says that he began to West@@ co , when he was the high school in my last years , when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hop@@ ed to pass their property to their sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted to land the brethren before judgment , &quot; wrote them . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no more part of De Lu@@ tis @-@ group , whereby Col@@ in claims that Mark in leaving the company 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; both Luke and Mark , says Paul &quot; became bitter about the terms of their financial separation . &quot;
Col@@ in has kept very back though he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography of the year 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of the TV stars .
Fair@@ fax Media took contact with Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their attor@@ neys .
&quot; only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; I really can not say much , &quot; because the case before the courts be . &quot;
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul has chosen to complain and draw our family names through the courts , he wrote . &quot;
in mid 2016 Col@@ in in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother .
&quot; our father would not have arous@@ ed that Paul and I would end in our current dispute , &quot; he said and added that he still hope for a solution . &quot;
on Friday the hope of being over to be over .
&quot; our affair will be solved in the near future by the courts , &quot; wrote Col@@ in . &quot;
Tru@@ mp@@ s new Stab@@ ili@@ ef plans to limit the media @-@ ab@@ in@@ ence of the President .
others have tried it and have failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
&quot; polic@@ tico reports that the new Chief Executive Officer of the White House is planning to restrict the information flow onto President Tru@@ mp - including reports of news media - in hope to hold the boss on an even moderate course . &quot;
here is a piece of re@@ por@@ ter Jos@@ h Daw@@ sey :
&quot; as John F. Kelly , the new Stab@@ sch@@ ef of the White House , met in his first working day with leading employees , he introduced a main problem in President Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s white house , which he fix : poor information that came into the hands of the president . &quot;
&quot; Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ing - because the president would make better decisions , if he would receive good information . &quot;
&quot; Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to nar@@ row@@ ed Tru@@ mp by monitor his media . &quot;
&quot; President Tru@@ mp@@ s relationship with television ranges decades back - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV is still strong . &quot;
&quot; if candidate Tru@@ mp was anno@@ yed because of in@@ fair reporting , it was productive to show him that he had a fair coverage of places that had to convince the former election consultant Sam Nun@@ berg in February opposite the police . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote to the time that &quot; &quot; the key to keep Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter habit under control , according to six former elect@@ oral campaign officials to ensure that his personal media has a rich praise . &quot;
okay .
&quot; but the idea that Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter habit ever was &quot; under control &quot; &quot; is ridic@@ ulous . &quot;
perhaps these refer@@ agn@@ en@@ be@@ am@@ ten know something we do not know - that Tru@@ mp@@ s T@@ we@@ ets had not included their interventions even more ig@@ nition .
we will probably never know anything about the T@@ we@@ ets which has not sent Tru@@ mp .
&quot; if his staff managed to establish it several times , trouble @-@ free of him , then their efforts have been worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; but no one has consistently prevented it , that Tru@@ mp is contro@@ vers@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; part of the problem consists of that people in a White House , which consists of competing parties , and again trying to present their own agenda by bringing the Tru@@ mp material that may possibly make their views of the world . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ tico - very busy with this history - reported in May about the preference for consultants , the president of strategic reasons , beyond doubt . &quot;
this was an example that was described by Repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tru@@ mp @-@ officials say that Tru@@ mp can react like a volcano on negative press cuts , especially those with sh@@ aded Lec@@ ks , and that he pointed out to figure out where they come . &quot;
&quot; just that happened at the end of February , when someone was turned out to be a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet @-@ Prov@@ ok@@ at@@ eurs Charles C. Johnson , who was the dep@@ uty chief executive officer in K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a he@@ ap of Lec@@ ks &quot; in the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson continued because of ch@@ ic@@ ans permanently from Twitter , or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has vo@@ iced false evidence and re@@ vo@@ ke it in the past . &quot;
Tru@@ mp read the article and started to ask staff about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; Gold@@ macher added that the dam@@ al@@ ous Stab@@ ili@@ ef Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage the pap@@ ule , and document the Tru@@ mp . &quot;
how did it work ?
Kelly tries three months later to do the same .
&quot; perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager as a pri@@ est@@ us , but Tru@@ mp is still his supporters Self , and his consultants are still seeking influence . &quot;
these un@@ changing factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
Master@@ ing crimin@@ als get post from Euro@@ pol
&quot; because the address is unknown , the mi@@ tigation of the people will pray and hopes . &quot;
the police across Europe will be ma@@ iled this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards to dangerous crimin@@ als on the run .
&quot; since the addresses of the sear@@ ched heavy @-@ bre@@ aker is not known , above all , evidence from the population is hop@@ ed and pray . &quot;
&quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action , which follow the &quot; &quot; Most W@@ anted &quot; &quot; Adv@@ ent Calendar of the winter . &quot;
the experiences would have shown that many sh@@ ear@@ chers are hidden on holiday resorts , it was called Euro@@ pol . &quot;
one has compiled 21 Post@@ cards for sear@@ ched crimin@@ als from 21 EU countries .
&quot; since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ s , more than 2.5 million times has been viewed . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the online photographs could have been arrested so far , at least eleven of them due to indications for publication on the website . &quot;
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to &apos; Milli@@ on@@ är@@ s @-@ Series &apos;
&quot; some of the weal@@ thi@@ est land@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands stand again with some resol@@ ute travellers on war bar@@ ef@@ oot , who have negotiated one from the municipality of zo@@ oming dit@@ ch , to return a field before their homes . &quot;
&quot; the travelers have par@@ ked their 20 caravans on a field outside a prosper@@ ous street of Soli@@ h@@ ull , which is called &quot; &quot; milli@@ on@@ är@@ s &quot; &quot; row . &quot;
&quot; they have brought to horses , babies and a army of transpor@@ ters , having been postpon@@ ed only in May , without having been sh@@ elled from one by the Council , to prevent their inci@@ dents . &quot;
the tac@@ tical group found a gap in the defense units and oppressed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; angry inhabitants have made the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull , who said it was us@@ eless to deal with the problem . &quot;
&quot; an anonymous inhabitants said : &quot; &quot; they are taken on the assembly day after they were sent by Bentley He@@ ath , where they thrown stones onto the pas@@ sers . &quot;
the council must be forced by shame to implement it when dealing with the problem was us@@ eless .
the travelers were there in May and were moved back and are now back .
&quot; more arrived yesterday evening , probably today more . &quot;
&quot; they added : &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by holding long under@@ taking to protect their parks . &quot;
&quot; I live on the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my simil@@ arity , if the Council can &apos;t even stop it . &quot;
&quot; a living who didn &apos;t want to be called , said , &quot; It is ridic@@ ulous , we just have seen the last round of this travel@@ er just to be taken by another round . &quot;
the numbers have already increased this time and you even saw a horse in the parking area . &quot;
&quot; a speaker of the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; &quot; we are conscious of a dirt bearing on the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps so quickly as possible . &quot;
&quot; to support our evidence collection , it is very important that many resi@@ sts present an anti @-@ social or criminal behavior with the police by calling the 101 . &quot;
&quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court has to examine , when we present our case . &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof will Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise will take place .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts is currently renovated and will be opened on 1st March next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; because with the closing of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof by the dam@@ al@@ ous ambiance factory gesellschaft mbH on the 13th of April 2014 , approximately 30 000 nights spent per year lost and also earnings by the city &apos;s tax . &quot;
&quot; in the fall of 2014 , in view of the dramatic numbers of refugees who arrived in the county of land , the hotel buildings offered as a collective accommodation , which cat@@ ered for contro@@ vers@@ y discussions . &quot;
the city prevented prevented accommodation from asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was at that time in the council not un@@ disp@@ uted .
&quot; but above all Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts Ober@@ bür@@ germ@@ eister Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location , and spoke at that time of ern@@ st@@ increasing applicants from the house . &quot;
he should be right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels with chair@@ men Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof in Berlin and will make it again a house of the three @-@ star @-@ Plus category under the name of Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städter object four houses .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
&quot; you hot Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof has been standing in front of the entrance , and when one enters the house , clearly what extensive renovation work will be made . &quot;
&quot; the so@@ ils have been cut out , blankets to part ab@@ constructed , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
until March there is still much to do .
&quot; it is actually a lovely place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything should be renewed in the Black @-@ style .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large walk@@ able showers , the entrance area is trans@@ figured out , the new window will be built . &quot;
&quot; everything sol@@ ves later &quot; &quot; nice citizenship &quot; , &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer expressed . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a jewel of it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the equipment . &quot;
&quot; you would not set up at the high level of the hotel in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on an up@@ scale downtown level , empha@@ sized . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise , with its approximately 60 rooms w@@ ager up to a wide range of 60 rooms . &quot;
&quot; both individual ho@@ liday@@ makers , groups or busin@@ ess@@ men should feel at the hotel . &quot;
&quot; talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism @-@ direc@@ tional Michael Kr@@ ause he already led , so p@@ ile . &quot;
the performances of the city are covered with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; according to the amount of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer will not be able to specify exactly . &quot;
&quot; just under a million euro , he expects . &quot;
&quot; the outdoor installations are also brought to the fore@@ man , which is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; a large patio comes into a large terrace , which is open to the restaurant that is publicly available . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ aires : us @-@ Special Acc@@ ler requires Grand Jury
&quot; in the Russia affair , U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp should have appointed a so @-@ called Grand Jury as a report by the former Grand Jury . &quot;
&quot; the Panel included the work last weeks , the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; wrote to appeal to the more familiar persons . &quot;
the newspaper sen@@ sed the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has extended its investigation and intensified .
the radio CN@@ N reported it already give the first inv@@ itations of the Gre@@ mi@@ um in connection with a meeting between Tru@@ mp@@ s äl@@ test@@ em Son and a Russian lawyer .
&quot; intelligence services acc@@ ents the Kre@@ m@@ lin since longer , specifically mixed in the presidential campaign in 2016 . &quot;
Mu@@ eller investig@@ ates whether there were talking between Tru@@ mp@@ s elect@@ oral team and Moscow .
the focus of the investigation should be several men standing in the campaign as a consultant of the Republi@@ can .
&quot; to report , Mu@@ eller also took more and more Tru@@ mp@@ s private and business environment under the magni@@ fying glass . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Tribunal Tru@@ mp are personally involved in the Centre and acc@@ esses the acc@@ us@@ ation , whether the president in the course of the affair may have hin@@ dered the judiciary . &quot;
&quot; the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to consider this evidence of possible break@@ age , and decide to determine whether the indic@@ t@@ ment should be raised . &quot;
Grand j@@ uries are therefore also called charges .
mostly they are switched on when it is a larger and contro@@ vers@@ y cases .
the procedure is always behind closed doors .
&quot; in addition , the panel can also be switched on from the prosec@@ ut@@ or to rechar@@ ge persons to the operator under E@@ id . &quot;
&quot; according to the transmitter CN@@ N , the inv@@ itations were already issued to turn the meeting between Donald Tru@@ mp J@@ R. and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
people who participated in the meeting were asked to be asked to a statement that was called in the report .
&quot; in addition , they should provide documents . &quot;
besides Tru@@ mp J@@ R. also were Tru@@ mp@@ s consultant and son @-@ law J@@ ared Kus@@ hn@@ er as well as his great elect@@ oral election of Paul Man@@ kind during the interview .
&quot; legal experts said on Thursday lunch in the U.S. television , that the inser@@ tion will show that Mu@@ eller is not shy in his work and that he should be needed , quick to act quickly . &quot;
&quot; but it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be switched on at the end , in order to decide on the elevation of an indic@@ t@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the establishment of the Gre@@ mi@@ ums is the beginning of a new phase in the studies and a new reason concern concern for President Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new revelations , the President on Thursday morning a speech in West Virginia was to represent Russia &apos;s affair as a campaign for his political opponents . &quot;
&quot; the Russia @-@ story is a total invention , &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; the theme give the Democrats a way to feel good , because they have nothing else about whom they can talk . &quot;
his special consultant T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in an opinion that he know@@ eth nothing of the installation of a Grand Jury .
&quot; but this is usually work in secret , he stressed . &quot;
&quot; the White House is concerned about all measures , which accelerated the work of the Special Tribunal for &quot; &quot; faire &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the former F@@ BI @-@ Chef James Com@@ ey have said three times that no effect can be determined against the President .
&quot; I have no reason to accept that it has changed something , it was on the explanation . &quot;
&quot; Mu@@ eller was only used , after Tru@@ mp Com@@ ey had fallen . &quot;
because of this rat were alleg@@ ations against Tru@@ mp loud he wanted to hin@@ der the judiciary .
&quot; Com@@ ey said in June in front of a Senate Committee , Tru@@ mp have asked him to ask for an attitude of investigation against the then national security consultant Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n . &quot;
the president is under great pressure because of the examination .
according to the representation of US media the White House gathered material against the special spind@@ le and its employees .
the proceeds spec@@ ulation about whether Tru@@ mp Mu@@ eller will be released .
&quot; other than an independent special character of the congress as well as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair , the President Richard Ni@@ x@@ on , has drawn Mu@@ eller a position in which he theoretically could be judged by the President of the Federal Ministry of Justice . &quot;
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to avoid such a step .
two groups of rep@@ ublic@@ ans and democratic sen@@ ators held on Thursday leg@@ ent@@ ment after which the special values could no longer be released .
Ant@@ arc@@ tica : gigantic ice @-@ mountain driving in the Ant@@ arc@@ tic
&quot; in the West@@ ant@@ arc@@ tica , there has been a gigantic ice ic@@ eberg from the Sch@@ el@@ eventh &apos;s size of Berlin . &quot;
this shared the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred Weg@@ ener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
&quot; the over a Bil@@ lion tons of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometers , large pist@@ on stem from north and will probably be two , three years until he was mel@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; it is recorded with 175 kilometers length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , one of the largest ov@@ ists , which have registered researchers in the past three decades . &quot;
a danger for people does not go from him .
&quot; however , the climate change has played a role in the departure of the ic@@ eberg , is un@@ clear after research . &quot;
&quot; however , there has been a series of unusual co@@ qu@@ arri@@ es in the region for about 30 years , writes the U.S. research center for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fac@@ sim@@ ile . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , this could be associated with the heating @-@ up . &quot;
the pist@@ on pist@@ on was so far a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ress .
Sch@@ el@@ ress swi@@ ms on the sea and is fed by big gl@@ aci@@ ers .
it continues to grow in the sea and breaks regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ress is located south of South America almost at the top of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula .
North of the spring was the balance of wax and v@@ om@@ iting a few years ago .
a complete sk@@ el@@ der was cr@@ ush there , writes AW@@ I @-@ resear@@ cher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
&quot; I speak a lot for this , that also the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ress in danger , because the front @-@ front se@@ pt have never seen so far as it is currently . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the ice plate is under stress and can dis@@ integrate , if at a key point , a piece cr@@ ush@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the mel@@ ting of sh@@ ale and ic@@ eberg increases the sea level not , since they flo@@ ating on the water and pushed ice as much water as it comes after the mel@@ ting itself . &quot;
&quot; however , the loss of the springs that the gl@@ aci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase the sea level , however only in the light measure , writes the British research project to the observation of the Ant@@ arc@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot;
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ress is according to AW@@ I data with almost 50 000 square kilometres , the four @-@ largest sk@@ el@@ der of the Ant@@ arc@@ tica . &quot;
&quot; at the passage from the mainland , it is up to 700 metres thick , at the front @-@ edge to the free ocean about 200 meters . &quot;
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; although there is a natural happening and no direct connection to climate change is conscious , the ice plate is now in a je@@ ure position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British Sw@@ an@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the biggest withdrawal since the beginning of the record , &quot; confirmed he also confirmed . &quot;
&quot; among scientists be contro@@ versi@@ al whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ celebrated again will grow back or long , and possibly coinci@@ ded , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but these developments will last decades .
&quot; even though this researchers will not return the break@@ age of this gigantic ice cream , not on climate change , so in recent decades have a lot of ov@@ eb@@ ies of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula . &quot;
this long time from the Ant@@ arc@@ tica covers the direction of South America .
according to data from the research program British Ant@@ arc@@ tic Survey is the ice cream of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula since the 1950@@ s has decreased by 28 000 square kilometers .
for the decline the temperature rose contributed .
the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula have passed around three degrees around three degrees warmer and ste@@ ep@@ le with it in the areas where temperature is the fastest .
CD@@ U aims at home star@@ if during the staff
&quot; because it is becoming more difficult to occupy free @-@ proof positions , the CD@@ U are ur@@ ged to step out of the worker association to become more attractive . &quot;
only shortly before the summer break the K@@ rei@@ day has made 41 new places in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
&quot; now , 17 trainees have seen their first working day . &quot;
the cur@@ riculum in the circle are apparently very gif@@ ted .
around 620 applications were to be booked for the places this year .
&quot; nevertheless , the circle continues to be extended to manage the increasing requirements and tasks . &quot;
currently there are currently 50 not occupied bodies in the circle M@@ ett@@ mann .
&quot; among other things , doctors and engineers are sought as well as forces of general administration . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative in the K@@ rei@@ day together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ DP initiative and enter the lack of lack of lack in administration .
&quot; the management should work according to the desire of the parties &quot; &quot; a concept of recruitment and human development . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the goal is to cover not only short @-@ term need for experts , but forward @-@ looking at the evaluation of the assessment , is called it . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should be based on inside and outside , concrete measures for cross @-@ clim@@ bers and involve an apprentic@@ es@@ hips , urge both CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
that sounds already after a good approach .
because the circle has to do with human problems that one was not known earlier .
other cities advertise good official officials and provide more attractive terms .
the speech is given by a regular &quot; competition of public employers . &quot;
&quot; this includes a high number of employees , the disease or alter@@ ation of the service caused by the service . &quot;
&quot; so , the highest time for action so that no more places remain un@@ occupied . &quot;
&quot; however , Klaus @-@ Dieter nations , leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common application with his party . &quot;
&quot; he has long been studied in the chal@@ k day for a f@@ au@@ st@@ ful surprise , when he was publicly available in question and the rest of the parties too . &quot;
people want to be reviewed all the possibilities that make a discharge from the municipal workers union association .
&quot; if we are not at short notice about a satisfactory solution , the subject @-@ administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in collaboration with the county @-@ affiliated towns - a home star@@ if seek , so peoples . &quot;
&quot; with this , the CD@@ U , the employees and officials try to pay better than it actually fores@@ ee tariff barriers to the public service . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries are currently exact , enh@@ ancements or more money there is only when one changes in a higher level that is orient@@ ated in professional years . &quot;
but the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be furnished to take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitution protection law . &quot;
&quot; not least , by the rising number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ Council Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direc@@ tional Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little personnel . &quot;
Italy shar@@ p@@ ly shar@@ pen the tone to the NGO &quot; migrants &quot; lif@@ ebo@@ ats
&quot; Italy led NGOs , war@@ ned the lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , war@@ ned that they may not continue , if they do not stop new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not write a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how to work on , &quot; said Interior Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Tur@@ iner daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot;
&quot; Min@@ niti@@ s warning came a day after the Italian authorities had a boat of the German aid organisation &apos; youth Ret@@ ri@@ ded &apos; conf@@ isc@@ ated , because whose team had worked effectively with human traff@@ ick@@ ers in a way that facilit@@ ated the illegal immigration . &quot;
&quot; the aid organisation , which is only in operation since one year , it has been tac@@ kl@@ ed to express themselves at a detailed preview of the Italian State Department Amb@@ ro@@ gio Cart@@ osi@@ o . &quot;
&quot; for us and remains the saving of human life our top priority . so we are sorry that we can not operate at the moment in the search and ambulance zone , &quot; said the organization in an opinion on social media . &quot;
&quot; we can only judge all acc@@ us@@ ations that are currently collected , only after we have collected all information and can judge the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities had the boat of &apos; youth Ret@@ ri@@ ds &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , super@@ vised since October . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that his crew and infl@@ atable migrants will take them on board , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can be cancelled , so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one such a coinci@@ dence , suppos@@ edly only 1,@@ 3 miles before the Liby@@ an coast took place , according to the ac@@ ute of the prosec@@ ut@@ or , whose content of Italian media has been published . &quot;
the occupation is sus@@ pic@@ tured about the authority of the Italian coast guard the b@@ ail@@ ments in the zone made of humanitarian reasons and not by any other moti@@ fs monitored .
&quot; under the code of conduct , boats like the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta must first have an Italian police officers on board who super@@ vised their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and b@@ ail@@ out attempts have so far declared to hold the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would consider as unnecessary but acceptable , since they would not bring &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; of their lif@@ esp@@ an &quot; &quot; actions . &quot;
&quot; among those who refuse to sign , the No@@ bel lau@@ re@@ ates of doctors without borders ( MS@@ F ) . &quot;
&quot; by now , Minn@@ iti said that the number of migrants who has declined in Italy during the last weeks , that efforts to strengthen the Liby@@ an coastal wake and cooperation with local Mayor &apos;s fruits . &quot;
&quot; in recent days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; he gave plans for further talks with Liby@@ an May@@ ors in this month about economic development initiatives , and with Cher@@ ad , N@@ iger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to achieve Europe . &quot;
asc@@ ents and tri@@ als
&quot; nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer bikers , the &quot; Berliner exterior &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the Nord@@ pf@@ alz to enjoy four days long and attractions . &quot;
there were three ordered guides at your disposal .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ undy and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome Extra .
the first tour conducted in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ sk@@ ap@@ elle above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; there followed view@@ points , partly on towers , of which one could look far beyond the P@@ fäl@@ zer forest and the se@@ ated levels . &quot;

sit the sport stars in future ahead of computer con@@ soles instead of fighting wind and weather over the stadium system ?
&quot; the fact is : e @-@ sports is long since a serious growing industry , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions fans and huge tournaments with high gifts . &quot;
&quot; this also recognised the first federal states , who are increasingly involved in this field . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning of 2015 the V@@ f@@ L Wol@@ fs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the VF@@ B Stuttgart , founded in mid July an e @-@ sport department and took two professionals for computer game FIFA 17 . &quot;

&quot; he is safe , &quot; that on these train still rise out . &quot;
&quot; the coming weekend of the World Cup of FIFA in London organised the first &quot; &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; , &quot; with which the gam@@ ers of various clubs are introduced to each other . &quot;
&quot; besides Schal@@ ke and Wol@@ fs@@ burg , for example Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eind@@ hoven . &quot;
also Robin Dut@@ t looks great potential in the e @-@ sports .
the ex @-@ Trainer by Bayer Lever@@ kus@@ en and Wer@@ der Bremen is now an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; the real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds , that young people also go into the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and : the los@@ ers , all sorts of markets , especially the Asian , to con@@ quer . &quot;
&quot; with prominent e @-@ spor@@ tsmen , one could be present online by far more than once in the year the Bundes@@ lig@@ aments , to Asia . &quot;
what is it exactly ?
&quot; in the E @-@ Sports , computer games like &quot; League Of Legends &quot; , &quot; Dot@@ A 2 , &quot; &quot; Counter@@ strike &quot; or even the football @-@ simulation FIFA on competition level . &quot;
&quot; long since , as in normal sport , Li@@ gen have established , in which the pros can compete against each other . &quot;
and in the Asia @-@ Asia E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program .
but is it all about the right sport ?
for many people this idea is used to be used .
even In@@ go F@@ rob@@ bed has long been posed with the question .
&quot; for the professor at the German Spor@@ tho@@ chschule in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport , because it is kom@@ peti@@ tive and many biological and physical reactions to show that you can find in classical sport , for example , hormonal changes , hormonal changes . &quot;
&quot; moreover , there are cog@@ nitive capabilities , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a quick reaction . &quot;
&quot; professional gam@@ ers should not only be carried out at the console , but also to exercise their body and respect the diet . &quot;
&quot; the f@@ itte player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; but also problems : &quot; mental is becoming more and more a subject . &quot;
controls are difficult to run on online gaming and in the scene lack@@ ed the structures of classical sport .
the scientists stand by the scientists the high integr@@ ative effect of the E @-@ Sports .
&quot; players are international on the road , this is like a big global family , there are no intercultural shirts . &quot;
a study of the management consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Bundes@@ feder@@ ate Interactive Media Software ( BI@@ U ) tells the E @-@ Sports a rapid growth .
&quot; in order to be implemented in Germany 50 million euros , mainly through advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments . &quot;
&quot; in three years , sales at 130 million will be expected . &quot;
against the almost 2.4 billion of the Bundes@@ liga this is little .
&quot; however , the E @-@ Sports &quot; is not far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice @-@ hockey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte advis@@ ors . &quot;
international are already a number of countries .
large markets are Asia and the U.S. where ex @-@ basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez at the US team NR@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ashton Kut@@ cher is investing in the e@@ Sport @-@ competition Uni@@ kr@@ s .
also in Europe is doing a lot .
&quot; in an Norwegian School of E @-@ Sport as a Sub@@ ject , says F@@ rob@@ bed . &quot;
&quot; in the Netherlands and in France , the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Ver@@ eine according to Dut@@ t is now committed to set up a E @-@ Sport Department . &quot;
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany lag@@ ging Germany , &quot; &quot; VF@@ B @-@ Board &quot; &quot; Rö@@ tt@@ Germ@@ ann . &quot;
&quot; only in nostal@@ gia to fall , and the old times to clarify , is no longer sufficient . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about to preserve the tradition of the association , but the company at the same time al@@ ign with the modern market . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digi@@ ti@@ sed world , &quot; says also Dut@@ t . &quot;
&quot; there you can not stick to it , that only when football do everything remains as it was always . &quot;

Michelle Carter because of the lyrics by pushing Conrad Roy to su@@ icide
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boyfriend through texts and calls to su@@ icide .
&quot; Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their condem@@ nation behind bars and five years have been exposed . &quot;
&quot; Carter was condemned by Conrad Roy in June , who took life on 13 July 2014 . &quot;
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is un@@ tr@@ aver@@ se .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free until call .
&quot; it was faced with a maximum of 20 years , but their legal representative was argu@@ ed that both she and Mr Roy , on a mental illness . &quot;
&quot; dres@@ sed in red p@@ ants and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , was Carter since with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and according to the laid eyes , when it was sentenced . &quot;
&quot; their actions have brought Conrad Roy , &quot; said the prosec@@ ut@@ or to the Court . &quot;
she ended his life to make their own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility for , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it has no rep@@ ent@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; but Car@@ ters attorney said , it was a &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful conversion , which she totally de@@ pl@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; however , judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , he did not find that her &quot; &quot; age or irrit@@ ation is a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a prosec@@ ution read a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said there &quot; no day there , in which I don &apos;t smo@@ ked the loss of my beloved Son . &quot;
&quot; I want to be proud of me and how I go with everything I am trying . I try , despite all of my pain , which we will carry with us for eternity with us , for his sisters . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ d@@ yn Roy , said that they will be trac@@ ed by the realization &quot; , &quot; that they will never be part in the wedding of their brother or would be a a@@ unt for his children . &quot;
&quot; no longer this only person to have , with which I was together every day since my birth , is a pain , which I will keep for the rest of my life forever , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to put a legal preced@@ ence because there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to commit a different su@@ icide . &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in 2014 by a carbon mon@@ ition in one vehicle .
&quot; the case drew a national attention to himself , after car@@ ters revealed texts , that they had encouraged him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; Hän@@ g you , spring of a building , er@@ ste@@ che yourself , I do not know there are many ways , &quot; &quot; she said in several messages that she sent in the two weeks before his death . &quot;
&quot; in the eyes of his su@@ icide she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Conrad &quot; and &quot; All that you have to do is to switch the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judges Mon@@ iz said that Carter &apos;s attention was sought by the death of Roy and suggested that they are benef@@ ited by some media from the event .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
&quot; to the few , the Carter defended , belon@@ ged to Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , which was condemned in Italy because of Mor@@ ing in their British ro@@ ommate in Italy before she was released two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published in the Los Angeles Times a comment : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ me : learning from the new Mini @-@ l@@ ah@@ m of the FC Bayern
&quot; that Joshua was allowed to run by Audi Cup as captain , is no coinci@@ dence . &quot;
the FC Bayern tr@@ aut the Con@@ fed Cup winner a large season - Extra motivation does not inter@@ f@@ ere .
&quot; something was so different on his place in the cabin , that saw Joshua Kim@@ me immediately , even if the extra gar@@ ment was very small , very small . &quot;
&quot; but since far and wide on the second day of Audi C@@ ups , of course , there was no Philipp le@@ ah@@ m , and also no Manuel Neu@@ er , he made himself a shared refer@@ ee on the arm . &quot;
&quot; the coach has not announced it , told the Con@@ fed Cup winner , after his first use as Bayern @-@ captain . &quot;
good that could have been able to run better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign of the coach was able to suggest Kim@@ me so .
&quot; not the eight year old Art@@ uro Vi@@ dal was born in the children of youth , Deb@@ ut@@ ants and straight out of the holiday @-@ commented pros existing C @-@ El@@ f as a player leaders , but he . &quot;
&quot; sugars are distributed at the de@@ ar@@ est ones at those who want to hold a lot , that you want to keep in mood . &quot;
&quot; so who was chosen to compete with the heritage of l@@ ah@@ m , a small extra @-@ motivation can only be used well . &quot;
&quot; Kim@@ me confirmed , &quot; this is what you want to be as a player : responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday fl@@ itz@@ te of the 22 @-@ year @-@ old as mini @-@ l@@ ah@@ m via the field .
&quot; right behind , that is now his position , the white leg on the arm did her rest . &quot;
&quot; and at all , Kim@@ me in this start@@ formation like the one who can take the ru@@ ding to the hand at the best . &quot;
&quot; he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ divided complex@@ ion . &quot;
&quot; he had the view for the whole , while many others were busy themselves . &quot;
&quot; to keep up his missing point of fitness ( un@@ fol@@ ly hardly ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches to tie out to the achievements of Asia @-@ travel ( fol@@ d@@ ded also only , ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as addi@@ ctions , in their first appearance in Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ k@@ ot are not negative to fall . &quot;
this still fol@@ ds very good .
&quot; Sü@@ le ran alongside Kim@@ me , Ru@@ dy in front of the defense , both ag@@ gra@@ ined sou@@ ver@@ n . &quot;
the nam@@ eable Nap@@ oli @-@ storm was often difficult and also tried to succeed in the game building a few times .
his colleague Ru@@ dy gave us that the result was not so as we did that .
but he also showed a decent performance at the debut .
&quot; temp@@ ting , Temp@@ ow@@ ech@@ sel : &quot; for this style I was also fet@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; how un@@ used this Bayern @-@ world is still for the new , I saw in connection to the game . &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ dy for example given in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs not one or two , but determines six or seven interviews . &quot;
Kim@@ me passed after a few cris@@ p statements in the back of his new fellow @-@ player .
&quot; he heard about Sü@@ le an interesting phrase : &quot; what goes here , I have already noticed . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , you simply need to win any game . &quot;
&quot; after all , he must no longer teach the New Testament . &quot;

company pleased with rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pf@@ alz minister : economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ s@@ ings Tempo
&quot; this often proved to be irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still the economic Ministry of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palatinate . &quot;
&quot; this is after more than one year , in which the new economic ini@@ ster Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office . &quot;
chambers and companies from the region speak to T V @-@ request from a change in economic and impeccable at the same time the old minister .
&quot; Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ er companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing covers the wishes of the economy , the Lem@@ ke all blocked . &quot;
the biggest K@@ ehr@@ an de sees so@@ us in the Infra@@ structure policy : the bridge of the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the Pri@@ ority &apos;s list of the country now .
&quot; even this year the Ministry is hoping to prepare the Ministry of Plan , until 2005 the construction is to be right . &quot;
a role in the plans of the country also plays the West@@ um@@ ing Tri@@ er in the urgent need of the federal plan .
&quot; the aim is to take the route in December 2020 in operation , says Mini@@ stries by Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ us sees it a gu@@ ide@@ post for regional , but internationally competing businesses . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Commerce and Chamber of Commerce ( I@@ HK ) Tri@@ er seeks , to increase the sales of the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palatinate @-@ Label in order to increase the sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports for ten years . &quot;
&quot; besides , Wis@@ sing an open ear for people who want to start their own company , lo@@ gs the I@@ HK . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Cr@@ afts Tri@@ er sees in the new Master @-@ Bonus an additional incentive for young trainees , says CEO Matthias Schwal@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; it is intended to make a award of 1,000 Euro for the increased master@@ class and 2,@@ 500 Euro , if gradu@@ ates are self @-@ employed within ten years after the master@@ ing . &quot;
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; to create the planned road construction , at the same time the land at the required personnel , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , headquarters of the I@@ HK Tri@@ er . &quot;
&quot; of 56 new engineers , who wants to adjust the Wis@@ sing near the country &apos;s mobility , so far only 29 positions are occupied . &quot;
the I@@ HK is demanding to give more orders to external offices .
&quot; CD@@ U @-@ Fr@@ ac@@ vi@@ ze Christian Bal@@ d@@ on refers to calculations of the Court of Computer , the country of invest 2017 and 2018 more than 20 million euros less in obtaining local roads as proposed . &quot;
Frank Nat@@ us is also expecting a concept of the country as it wants to fix the lack of lack of lack in the region .
har@@ vesting is also the previous width @-@ band @-@ construction in the country .
in 2016 the regional company had rated the power supply in an I@@ HK survey only with a note 3.4 .

Audi is to change 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a return action
&quot; a day before the announcement of Audi said , BMW that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW president said , the company was the opinion that &quot; &quot; there is intelligent options as a limited restriction , and related to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based on offer or limit@@ ing vehicles . &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes @-@ cars in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the company as a recall .
European automotive manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; but the nitrogen ox@@ ides , the diesel engines are regarded as car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ s and can cause as@@ thma . &quot;
&quot; the cost of the automotive manufacturers , systems for neutr@@ alization of the diesel vehicles cl@@ ut@@ ches are also easy to install , take the price of it difficult to hold the price of the cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also indic@@ ted to ignore the powerful car firms and to ignore signs of the problem .
&quot; the companies attemp@@ ting to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen to prevent the use of so @-@ called sk@@ ill@@ ary devices that regulate emissions , if a car has been tested , but in normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States several candidates were indic@@ ted by Volkswagen , others are investigated on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
last month the former leader of the Ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the motor development of Audi in Germany .
&quot; the former manager , Zac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni Pam@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be placed in the United States . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning of this year , Audi was incorporated into German criminal investigation in Volkswagen , after the authorities installed on Audi to handle the emissions regulations in Europe and a request that focused on the United States has been extended . &quot;
the inclusion of Audi into the investigation could be Volkswagen heavy loads : the luxury automobile manufacturers will be proportional to the profit of Volkswagen .

Mor@@ di@@ llo was temporarily one of the best published cart@@ on cart@@ oons , the b@@ oll@@ es of his figures are his trademark .
also with 85 shows the Argent@@ inian yet and works on a film .
&quot; his message : laughter , &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist he suggested among other things as a character of bl@@ ur@@ ring card through - what it was frustr@@ ated .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when he lost my job , he said once . &quot;
&quot; after stages in Lima , New York and Paris was managed by the end of the 60s : with the release of his cart@@ oons in &quot; Paris match &quot; and then also in &quot; star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
&quot; even in China , Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans . &quot;
again and again the artists of cities inspire .
&quot; large , ro@@ un@@ dish mor@@ di@@ llo figures tum@@ ble in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning he &apos;s own personal data , and today still alive today , it works almost ten hours a day . &quot;

&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say it &apos;s strange to me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot;

lav@@ ender from Provence threatened by climate change
&quot; he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; lav@@ ender is due to that of dro@@ ught rec@@ alling conditions and because of the sick@@ le @-@ ward insects ward , what scientists and farmers who try to find solutions to find great he@@ ada@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , Expert of the agricultural research institution in CRI@@ EP@@ P@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; &quot; the Lav@@ ender in Provence is effectively vulnerable because the plant was exposed to the effects of climate change in spring and in autumn much more . &quot;
this has effects on the life span of lav@@ ender .
&quot; there is also a small Z@@ ik@@ ade , a micro @-@ bacterial , over@@ s the d@@ warf , and in very dry weather there are very many of them . &quot;
and there is much at stake .
lav@@ ender oil lo@@ bes not only for ho@@ liday@@ makers it is also very sought for perf@@ umes and cosmetics .
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said , &quot; instead of having very long crop protection with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , UN@@ TE@@ REN@@ TW@@ IC@@ K@@ EL@@ TE and either missing or weak@@ ened . &quot;
so we have fewer parts with ether@@ ic oil . &quot;
&quot; among the solutions that are considered to be considered , a better water @-@ distribution and the slow@@ ing of the dun@@ ge@@ ons from the ground , but also the beast of plants with a protective mix of sound and water and the development of varieties , which are more durable . &quot;
the town of Ge@@ isa in the th@@ ür@@ n@@ ese R@@ hö@@ n celeb@@ rates its 1200 @-@ year anniversary .

the ass@@ ass@@ ination of a journalist emphasises the growing threat in Mexico
&quot; the staff of the weekly r@@ odo@@ ce meet normally , in order to review their plans for the reporting of the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a through organised crime , corrupt officials and ce@@ as@@ eless drug . &quot;
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of her own tragedy , they came together to talk about security . &quot;
it was told to them that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ level journalists discuss what is safer to feel : you should take their children with the office , who were at home the target of an attack with gran@@ ulates , or at home . &quot;
&quot; security experts have written three words on a black@@ board on the front of the room : opponents , Neutr@@ al , allies . &quot;
&quot; they ask the re@@ por@@ ters , name for each column - no evidence is necessary , perc@@ eptions and ab@@ dom@@ inal . &quot;
&quot; there are drugs , politicians , busin@@ ess@@ men , busin@@ ess@@ men , journalists , the susp@@ ected list of government or box , a catalogue of crimin@@ als that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no retirement ause by violence , and throughout the country the corp@@ ses are more and more journalists all over , since President En@@ ri@@ que Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to have entered into December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are after attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there were at least seven deaths in seven states . &quot;
&quot; among the latter there is their publisher and its inspir@@ er of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , the co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest bug it is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot;
&quot; his absence will be deeply felt deep , although its presence is present everywhere - a great photo of Val@@ dez , which shows his mid @-@ finger with the word &quot; Justice &quot; building . two re@@ por@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ riam Ram@@ i@@ rez , carry T @-@ shirts who will be able to show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ por@@ ter discuss about their shared topics , the trau@@ ma , their nigh@@ tm@@ are , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although 2010 , a Son@@ der @-@ Bundes@@ wehr was established in order to process the cases of journalists , this according to the Committee for the Protection of journalists was introduced only two criminal proceedings . &quot;
&quot; as with most thousands of Mor@@ den , which are connected every year with drug trading and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists will rarely be put in court . &quot;
&quot; in Ri@@ odo@@ sia they still exist to treat the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are un@@ tr@@ alled and even though the terrain is still ob@@ li@@ que . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meetings for the discussion of security , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very stupid to w@@ asting my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we do not know the Why , distr@@ ust it all . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez for@@ s@@ ook the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the provincial capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he managed to drive a few blocks away before his rot@@ er Toyota Cor@@ olla was raised by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , pres@@ um@@ ably because of the name of the newspaper - that is translated with &quot; &quot; twelve &quot; &quot; flow . &quot;
the cap was removed in his car and damaged it near .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he leaves a woman and two adult children .
&quot; ru@@ m@@ ly ten@@ ds to fly freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
but on the topic of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ mans sti@@ cking last year and delivery in the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a became one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t sl@@ ain areas of the country , since ri@@ v@@ alis@@ ating political groups are struggling to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it makes nothing that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or more people are shot at the road or that the cemetery is full of twi@@ sted , two @-@ story m@@ ash@@ een for drug @-@ rounder , which are bigger than many houses for the living . &quot;
&quot; for a minute , there is a state of &quot; tranquility &quot; if only a box control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs routes in the United States . &quot;
&quot; despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , with the gu@@ ilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ under@@ standings have contributed to the murder .
&quot; first , in February the release of a interview with Damas@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the ri@@ val card @-@ actions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans S@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; this publication may have consec@@ u@@ ated the sons , susp@@ ected Gang@@ lers @-@ members buy each copy of the output , as soon as it was supplied to time @-@ ki@@ os@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; the second mistake was not to force Val@@ dez , following the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper which had released the same story to leave the country to its own safety . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and its killing will be regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he had so long survived that his friends and colleagues helped him that he would be there .
&quot; he worked as an experienced re@@ por@@ ter for Nor@@ o@@ este , when he joined together with five colleagues in establishing Ri@@ odo@@ ce , and sold 50 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without hes@@ it@@ ry problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; with time , the newspaper exp@@ elled a reputation because of the cour@@ ageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising . &quot;
&quot; re@@ por@@ ter loved it , hard tre@@ ff@@ ening studies without fear of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else could catch . &quot;
eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors &quot; Prize &quot; for their coverage in Latin America .
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of journalists for his courage in the persecution of the Mexican drug history , wherever they conducted . &quot;
he gave himself up voluntarily to that he was afraid .
&quot; I would like to continue &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot;
&quot; drug trading in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a lifestyle , &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV . &quot;
you need to take over the task that falls as a journalist - either the or you play the dum@@ b .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; what have you done about so many still@@ s ... why did you not say what was before ? &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ odo@@ ce @-@ team miss Val@@ dez , the Sp@@ a@@ ß@@ bird , who was like a port @-@ bird , who was like a port workers , who was generous with h@@ ugs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survived . &quot;
you trust in his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
&quot; he would go to El Guay@@ n@@ abo , the bar across from office , go and sit there at the same table . &quot;
&quot; well , they ask : was his love for the routine be his verb@@ s ? &quot;
his death also comp@@ elled to ask her own assu@@ mp@@ tions about how they do their work best and remain alive .
&quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret start@@ up and cross @-@ railways &apos; to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high level of su@@ c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and self @-@ disclosure . &quot;
his own inst@@ in@@ ins trust .
&quot; if it sm@@ ells , keep away out of it . &quot;
&quot; anger is , said the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real that &quot; &quot; smell a sense that can be true ... and then the thing happens with J@@ avier . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are in Sin@@ alo@@ a no longer - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states , in which a toxic mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative sm@@ ug@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt governmental organizations . &quot;
the landscape is constantly changing .
&quot; in the room where the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for safety training were suddenly no palms . days previously , sp@@ y@@ ware , which is sold exclusively on governments to monitor journalists and activi@@ sts in Mexico . &quot;
outside examined two polic@@ emen shelter in front of the heat from 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a mid @-@ class district of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the joke , some of the re@@ por@@ ter asked whether this officers belong to the 50 percent of polic@@ emen , which govern@@ or himself the govern@@ or herself as a non @-@ trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; it is months since the re@@ por@@ ters have gone into the mountain landscape , where the drugs of drugs are de facto under control . &quot;
for the output of this week Ri@@ odo@@ ce has led to three main layers .
there was the ass@@ ass@@ ination of the brother of the former known Box@@ er Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é among the government spending that focused on the hom@@ etown of the Govern@@ ors .
&quot; and there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , one block from the office of the prosec@@ ut@@ or , a kid@@ n@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who was kid@@ n@@ apped or how it happened , so caution was advisable to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite locally from drug retailers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ por@@ ter made from public records , that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who ruled the institu@@ tion@@ ality of Party ( Pr@@ i ) , which reign@@ ed almost all political planes . &quot;
recently several Pr@@ i govern@@ ors were acc@@ used because of high @-@ class cases of corruption .
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real bat the Repor@@ ter , about previous inci@@ dents in this restaurant , including one , in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man depart@@ ed a military over@@ fall . &quot;
only a few months before had the reader considered the Kolum@@ ne of Val@@ dez as the best informed source of the kid@@ n@@ apping .
&quot; before we had already known what is happening , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; &quot; El FLACO &quot; because of its slim body . &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication are broken with our sources . &quot;
&quot; the office of Val@@ dez was devoted to the storage room for characters and sti@@ ckers , dedicated against the Mor@@ de of journalists , because the employees have become something they had never expected : activi@@ sts in the name of the press . &quot;
re@@ por@@ ter Mi@@ riam Ram@@ i@@ rez a few characters and went to a demonstration in the next morning to a demonstration because of a further journalist to the office of the prosec@@ ut@@ or .
&quot; Salvador Ada@@ me disappeared three days , after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western federal state Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; a burnt body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA testing that it is his . &quot;
throughout the country journalists have grown stronger by having organized in organized protests &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on sal@@ aries for and construction .
&quot; this day is the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the ass@@ ass@@ ination of Val@@ dez @-@ fortified Ram@@ i@@ rez the authorities , journalists , and bring them to them , because they said the truth . &quot;
&quot; since then , she has asked that it is once again shared by the government because it is concerned that their obj@@ ectivity has been viol@@ ated its obj@@ ectivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez had been repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico by organised crime , participating in the governmental and a gender society . &quot;
&quot; in his final book &quot; Nar@@ co journ@@ alism &quot; he wrote that re@@ por@@ ter will not only be killed by drugs , but also on the command of politicians and security forces that cont@@ ested with organised crime under a blank@@ et . &quot;
&quot; the media group &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ulo 19 &quot; launched more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials in the past year .
&quot; in Mexico , you die because they want to dis@@ m the mouth , &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the Mor@@ de have a det@@ er@@ rent effect . &quot;
nobody for@@ gets the death of the B@@ log@@ ger@@ in Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; your body was found along with a note , which suppos@@ edly was signed by Z@@ etas @-@ Kart@@ ell , &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer @-@ scanning and ear@@ phones next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the ass@@ ass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dent Miro@@ sl@@ ava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue as there El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the ass@@ ass@@ ination of its director in 2004 .
&quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ arez openly directed to the drug cart@@ els with a guideline on the front page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists from their home states or even fled from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it &apos;s hard to find work in exile and they are still watching the streets and search for dangers .
&quot; and sometimes they will be hun@@ ted , as it seems to be mur@@ dered by the photographer Rub@@ en Esp@@ in@@ osa , 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico @-@ City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who remain back and continue working , it is a daily dance with risk @-@ rich decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , the once po@@ et wanted to be , gives him that the drug stores him sc@@ ared . &quot;
&quot; Mexico is going to hell , and therefore I was re@@ por@@ ter &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , sat the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce on the side@@ walk before the office and d@@ rank beer , than once all their phones started . &quot;
a number of sl@@ ings with absor@@ bs and security forces near the seaside Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed gates .
the war escal@@ ates how it was promised by a series of Kart@@ ell messages in the region .
&quot; from the p@@ est@@ st@@ unt , they have released the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce via mobile phone . &quot;
the title page had to be changed on the next day .
Sir@@ mi@@ sts near - a further shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez cast a look at the polic@@ emen to see the guard to see if they were in willingness .
if they were afraid they did not show it .
&quot; among the enormous portrait of the found founder of the newspaper , its middle @-@ finger for all sin@@ alo@@ a was visible , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed its traces . &quot;
&quot; how can you just remember that , Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said , &quot; If on the same day , on which J@@ avier were mur@@ dered , the practic@@ ed me asked to send it to the coverage of the street . &quot;
din@@ os@@ aur used to devi@@ ate its enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue when also a fri@@ gh@@ tening .
&quot; now researchers have found that the first findings of the unbelievable Rhin@@ eland of a Canadian Berg@@ worker so well received , that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ os@@ aur &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was so well received that they could even determine that his sk@@ et@@ ched skin of red@@ dish Braun was - and they said , she could have had something of a &quot; &quot; rest@@ less past . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report in the magazine &quot; &quot; Current Biology &quot; &quot; presented him as &quot; &quot; the ast@@ ero@@ ded din@@ os@@ au@@ rs , which was ever found , and one of the best din@@ os@@ au@@ rs specimens in the world . &quot;
Fos@@ sil is a newly discovered kind of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs that lived in the middle of the chal@@ k period prior to 110 million and 112 million years .
&quot; his unbeliev@@ ably well er@@ ected state has resear@@ cher who describe it as &quot; really remarkable . &quot; &quot;
according to reports in National Geo@@ graphic is the ge@@ ot@@ ted plant vin@@ e@@ aters the best preserved Fos@@ sil of its kind .
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; he met something that seemed to be seen from the surrounding rock at the burst , and decided to see more accurately . &quot;
that of him discovered Fos@@ sil was sent into the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild animal within the 2,@@ 500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy gro@@ ov@@ ens . &quot;
after all this hard work the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you just blin@@ z@@ eln , you could almost believe that it has slept , &quot; said the main aut@@ or Cal@@ eb Brown , scientists at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum , where the creature is seen . &quot;
&quot; it will enter into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best @-@ preserved din@@ os@@ au@@ rs , the mon@@ a Lisa of the Dinos@@ au@@ ction . &quot;
&quot; researchers have found that these plant e@@ aters , although he is covered with an arm@@ or and a changing shell , probably being threatened by meat @-@ din@@ os@@ aur din@@ os@@ au@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the strongly ar@@ mo@@ red din@@ os@@ au@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to hide from smoking , and used a sh@@ iel@@ ding technology that is used as counter@@ ing , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this could have been allowed to better mix in its surroundings and to devi@@ ate its enemies , say experts , which indicates that it was threatened by major din@@ os@@ au@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million years old creature from the family of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs has made head@@ lines in May and now is now at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild beast and it was called Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta striking Mark Mitchell , one of a team who spent more than 7.@@ 000 hours in order to un@@ cover it carefully . &quot;
the ast@@ o@@ unding conservation of the copy allowed the Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the patterns and form of doll@@ s and arm@@ our about his body .
&quot; they discovered the counter sh@@ aded , a common defence method in the animal kingdom , which means that the leaders of the creature was dar@@ ker than their under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the counter sh@@ aded is common , the results are surprising because the size of Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta is by far the ones living in today . &quot;
it points out that the din@@ os@@ aur of sufficient pressure by meat of the din@@ os@@ aur din@@ os@@ au@@ rs was buried in the evolution of the confrontation as a means of survival .
&quot; but most contemporary animals , which use the counter sh@@ aded - think of deer , z@@ eb@@ ras or gir@@ der - are much smaller and vulnerable as boot@@ y , which sign@@ alized that this No@@ dos@@ rs was exposed to a true fight for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong smo@@ b@@ tier behavior on a massive , strongly ar@@ mo@@ red din@@ os@@ aur show how dangerous the din@@ os@@ au@@ rs have been to be the cra@@ yon time , said Brown . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic connections in their skins also shows that the skin of the din@@ os@@ au@@ rs was brown .
&quot; scientists will continue to investigate the animal in references about his life , including his cont@@ emp@@ tor , to find out what it has eaten it to his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ os@@ aur he died , into a river gr@@ ated and went out into the sea , where he s@@ ank on the back to the bottom . &quot;
&quot; at that time Alber@@ ta was as warm as southern flu@@ ori@@ da , and rivers and oceans probably spread much more inland than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs is really remarkable because it is completely covered with cont@@ ented skin , but also in three dimensions remains and the original form of the beast keeps it &quot; , &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the result is that the animal today looks almost as in the early we@@ k period .
&quot; you do not need much imagination to use it to re@@ construct it . if you only have a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that he is at sleep . &quot;
&quot; the chal@@ k period was a time , when huge Ther@@ opo@@ eia the , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ ation , which stood on two legs , the earth was crossed . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , the ty@@ ran@@ nos@@ au@@ rus Rex , millions of years after Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta lived , the ar@@ mo@@ red din@@ os@@ au@@ rs was hun@@ ted by some of his terrible ancestors . &quot;
&quot; to this belongs to the Acro@@ can@@ th@@ os@@ au@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters . &quot;
&quot; scientists , whose latest findings appear in the Faculty of Current Current Biology , believe that Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta was fail@@ ing after death in the sea and in mud . &quot;
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the ast@@ er@@ un@@ ned din@@ os@@ aur of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is complete from the mu@@ zzle to the thig@@ h . &quot;
the creatures were on average approximately 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have weigh@@ ed up to 3.000 pounds ( 1.@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch @-@ long peaks that rag@@ ged from his shoulders .
&quot; the researchers believe that the ar@@ mo@@ red crop was weak@@ ened by the western Canada , until a floo@@ ded river floo@@ ded into the open sea . &quot;
but the underwater quality of the din@@ os@@ au@@ rs keep his arm@@ or in exquisite item detail .
the hidden rem@@ n@@ ants of this special specimen are so well received that the door@@ step still cover hol@@ low tank boards along the din@@ os@@ au@@ rs
&quot; like Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko , written for National Geo@@ graphic , is such a level of conservation as &apos; rarely as a profit in Lot@@ to . &quot;
&quot; the more I ans@@ h , the conf@@ using it becomes . &quot;
hidden resi@@ des of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y tank @-@ plates that wear the sk@@ ull of the beast .
&quot; his right fore@@ front is on his side , his five fingers crossed upwards . &quot;
I can count the shoes on its sole .
in the storm : Mass@@ enk@@ aram@@ bol@@ age on A8 : many Ver@@ sions
fier@@ cer accident on Thurs@@ days on the A8 : nearly 30 cars are involved in a massage par@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
&quot; there are numerous Ver@@ sions , kilomet@@ re long st@@ ems - and g@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
on the highway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) has been viol@@ ated about 20 people late on Thursday morning .
&quot; according to the first information of the police were from 5 p.m. between the terminals Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during an th@@ under@@ stor@@ ms nearly 30 cars , among them probably also trucks . &quot;
the exact number of publishers will initially be given no information .
&quot; it is about light to moderate injury , &quot; &quot; said a Poli@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ cher . &quot;
a great out@@ break of lif@@ ebo@@ at was on the cas@@ c@@ ading place .
the A8 was completely locked in the direction of Munich .
&quot; in Tim@@ et@@ ched Munich , a round 10 kilometres has been a long drive . &quot;
like an AZ re@@ por@@ ter reported it was also on the head@@ way to massive disabilities - through numerous g@@ aff@@ ers .
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade is not@@ ated the characteristics of the vehicles that now have to count with delicate pen@@ alties .
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 hrs there was another accident on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
it was a coll@@ ision between a vehicle transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue @-@ hel@@ icopter was on the way to the in@@ genu@@ ity .
Deutsche Bahn : Group test@@ et &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in
it is a moment that has experienced almost every once again : nothing a@@ hn@@ ing is sitting in the train and sleeps .
or you are deep@@ ened in his work and has just an in@@ geni@@ ous thought .
and then : pu@@ ff@@ f .
comes the Schaff@@ ner and awak@@ ens an impro@@ per or ri@@ pe the driving wheel in the middle of the workflow .
timetable control .
but the times of inter@@ rup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn test@@ et is currently the loose card control .
you simply confirms the phone that one should be taken and used for the ticket .
&quot; currently , a test run on two routes is running . &quot;
&quot; if the offer is , we expand it . &quot;
&quot; it is expected to be available in Germany at the beginning of coming year , &quot; &quot; said a Bahn . &quot;
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; is called the rail , the ticket de@@ valuation without Schaff@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; to be able to use , however some conditions must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to booked an online ticket - what is already the most passengers already do .
&quot; it also has to have purchased via the App of the train , the DB Navigator , which is the most convenient way of ticket booking . &quot;
and finally you need a seat .
&quot; for the &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; works so : one climb@@ s in the train , calling his ticket to &quot; My Tickets &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with the test , then a button is released to the electronic release . &quot;
&quot; your mobile devices get a message on their mobile devices , that driving X is located on the train and the seats is Y . &quot;
comes the guide during the ticket control to square Y knows that there is a passenger with already paid online tickets there .
&quot; so you can continue to sleep , continue to remain silent . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; check @-@ in &quot; &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which is to use the passengers . &quot;
&quot; who wants to travel without Ticket@@ control by our train staff , checked in the DB Navigator simply himself . &quot;
&quot; this allows the guests to shape their travel time in the train of personal attention , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , marketing @-@ board of DB bin@@ der . &quot;
&quot; second Plus : &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to address the individual customer needs . &quot;
&quot; who often drives rail , knows that in addition to delay and pas@@ sten does not belong to the biggest hass@@ le of trouble . &quot;
&quot; for many times you have , in any case , however , one of the passengers not all the documents needed to make the purchase of online tickets . &quot;
either lacks the credit card or the pay@@ roll or otherwise a document that you have to proceed .
&quot; the result are endless discussions between support and driving to@@ ast , which leads to bad mood in the section or large space and delays in control of your own tickets and take the Schaff@@ ner at the end of time to worry about other issues . &quot;
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and even on the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
additional traction numbers on the same track are not yet un@@ locked .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sh@@ aken up to its core .
&quot; just one day after it was arrived in New York City , sitting in St. Louis Geb@@ or@@ ene on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment , which they rented and sc@@ roll@@ te by Facebook on their phone . &quot;
you stum@@ bled upon a post by someone of the high school .
&quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year child , and it is still on the street , called it there . &quot;
&quot; confused , since nobody else had posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the manual @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was constantly supplied on their Tim@@ eline ret@@ we@@ et@@ et .
&quot; the Rap@@ per from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white police in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , Mon . , killed live . &quot;
he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns leb@@ rid body that was stretched on the road and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; this is wild , and thought of Fer@@ rell . &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she placed her cell phone to return later in the evening to T@@ we@@ ets on the Can@@ field Drive later .
&quot; there were photos of the police band and people who cri@@ ed , and by a man who sco@@ red , Brow@@ ns father to be a sign with the in@@ scription : &quot; Fer@@ g@@ us@@ ons police have just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
watching a live Feed with which a polic@@ eman was standing in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with an inver@@ teb@@ dog .
&quot; in another video , she said , un@@ attended another polic@@ eman his ri@@ f@@ le and cri@@ ed , &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot;
&quot; this is not common , remembered Fer@@ rell on their statement . &quot;
that is not the kind of murder that we have used to acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to us and which we may have typical .
at this moment I felt Schütt@@ gut .
I was angry and we@@ pt . &quot;
you booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock she got her 6 year old daughter from the house of their father and decided that the two we would drive to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on next morning .
&quot; what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; , in the movies from the 11 . &quot;
&quot; it is a history of survival , and of the Protest@@ ants , the love and resistance , strength and resistance , which consists of the point of view of the human being , who live in the community and the streets are filled to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; as a Fer@@ rell with her daughter who carried a flower wedding and a suitable crown , after Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on drove the two a conversation that they had countless times before this morning , about the black experience and the black condition . &quot;
&quot; you did not remember how many people have taught you , when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; remember what she said . &quot;
&quot; we now go to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , because the police have killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not right . &quot;
&quot; I could not take it to , &quot; said Fer@@ rell later . &quot;
that which is happening today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
you have to know it and see it and be moved in it .
&quot; it must be well developed , not only acti@@ vis@@ m and organization but also to know the various layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free to release ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I have fortunate to give you an experience , in which they experienced no noble racism , it is not different from the next black women @-@ child . &quot;
&quot; I have the feeling , I would prove her a bad service to keep them away from it . &quot;
&quot; the first stop , when they arrived in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , was on the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became a camp@@ ground as the activi@@ sts on the possible non @-@ indic@@ t@@ ment of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
&quot; there , Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined together with a local business propriet@@ ors , the lunch made . &quot;
they prepared bags before and helped to pass them to prot@@ esters .
slowly started a new kind of acti@@ vis@@ m for Fer@@ rell .
&quot; my acti@@ vis@@ m changed totally after the 9th of August , she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Miss@@ our@@ i @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student N@@ urs@@ es Association and concentrated on eating justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I had no experience in organizing . &quot;
it has all come . &quot;
&quot; weeks later , Fer@@ rell was met during an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ director of the film . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her c@@ amer@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ r@@ ar wanted to be &quot; documented &quot; what happened .
&quot; a question came , Fer@@ rell in the meaning : &quot; do you want to document , or try to find a story that you can utilize ? &quot;
&quot; these skep@@ tic@@ ism was nour@@ ished through countless cases of people , often from wh@@ ites in a community that benef@@ ited from her pain and their resistance . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently explained in an interview : &quot; &quot; we heard that people who were born in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on and raised their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already collabor@@ ated with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area that is known for his acti@@ vis@@ m around To@@ de@@ str@@ akt . &quot;
his commitment brought Fer@@ rell the project closer together with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after browsing of shooting .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we talk , &quot; &quot; Davis . &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me , as these people are represented , as I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was to concentrate on Fer@@ rel@@ ls experience - to show that it is with the movement &quot; not about a Messi@@ ah leader , but about a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the most obvious participant in the film . &quot;
&quot; what do documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets show ? &quot; surprising personal aspects of Fer@@ rel@@ ls life , as she loves herself and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed , when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability at this work and in the human being of black people .
&quot; in addition , Fer@@ rel@@ ls has repeated history the role of black gay women in the wider black li@@ ves . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , which have shaped the film &quot; &quot; Black@@ berry Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media in 2012 , identify themselves as sul@@ ul . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in executive positions have borne the movement in total , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women need to carry the main burden of everything . &quot;
notice to notice that &quot; the movement really is maintained by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; however , it consists of that &quot; this is no affir@@ mati@@ ver type of action , &quot; when the Fer@@ rell was selected as the heart of the film . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is no coinci@@ dence , although she was on the front line because with a life on these cru@@ ises as a black , gay woman so much on the game . &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the news cameras in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on are long since disappeared , but the racial connections between the church and the police continue to exist . &quot;
Fer@@ rell is ass@@ ass@@ ing for 2 ½ years due to the block@@ age of a highway in a demonstration .
&quot; it describes the soci@@ opoli@@ tical atmosphere of the area that she calls her home : &quot; a m@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; nonetheless , she f@@ ade her voc@@ als and she feels that memory , since she went to the street three years ago in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on . &quot;
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we have to love each other and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; Siz@@ er &quot; : TV @-@ readers discuss about bit @-@ gallery
&quot; the bit gallery moves the people , although it is not yet built for a long time . &quot;
but the idea of a shopping centre at the southern part of the pedestrian zone was switched on since the first presentation 2009 the population in advoc@@ ates and opponents .
cold leaves the subject hardly any .
&quot; also on our Facebook @-@ page &quot; &quot; People &apos;s &quot; &quot; and Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; is discussed . &quot;
&quot; while the one to the bit gallery say : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; that would be genuine class &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; does not need a man &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ alls ) or very simple : &quot; size w@@ ahn ! &quot; &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) . &quot;
&quot; as the advoc@@ ates to build out that a gallery will take more customers in the city , of which the remaining stores are benef@@ ited , fear the opponents , that then the pedestrian zone ble@@ eding . &quot;
&quot; added to the gallery , the gallery is planned exactly on the property , on which the peasant market hall is available in the 13 direct market . &quot;
with the beginning of the construction work will be an end .
the Galerie M@@ acher want to integrate a market hall in the new building - and indeed for use with possibility of sitting outside sitting .
Simone Rooms : &quot; we have been buying nearly weekly in the market hall for many years .
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of land@@ slides still very happy . &quot;
also the but@@ cher we have discovered for us .
we would like to wish that during and especially after the construction of the gallery a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities it is also available .
&quot; especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
&quot; Ger@@ d D@@ ensing : &quot; if direct it is marketed in a market hall in the gallery , comes to the amount of rent . &quot;
&quot; however , this is likely to be too low in the new project . &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; why is shopping in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ ging or supermarkets : I find that super@@ flu@@ ous . &quot;
there are enough of them in our city .
one can see how many shop@@ pers are here empty - some have been here for months and years .
&quot; but here it is not even a weekly weekend , it is all the more important that we remain at least the market hall . &quot;
&quot; after all , the goods offered are fresh@@ ly fresh@@ ly , is mostly offered directly from the producer and is very purely inexpensive . &quot;
&quot; as one sees , shop@@ stores are reserved in a shopping centre only by larger firms , because the dor@@ m mi@@ ties are often not portable for a ret@@ ailer . &quot;
&quot; too bad , special stores exist almost no more and that which is still left , then will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping mall with a Mark@@ thalle that suits me not .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
first of all : where should the peasant market place during construction time ?
&quot; the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - also on length , if the bit @-@ gallery will actually happen . &quot;
or creates it the gh@@ ost bit @-@ gallery already before to exp@@ el all business from Bit@@ burg ?
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; this simply will not work .
&quot; and a shopping center , that is empty , also no one needs . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real peasant market , instead of this gallery . &quot;
&quot; but for a peasant market hall it is thanks to the wa@@ hn@@ y many - as I find - sensu@@ al construction projects in Bit@@ burg no place anymore . &quot;
&quot; if the peasant market renovation is made , again a piece of culture will disappear . &quot;
a suitable simil@@ arity : artist creates por@@ traits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
&quot; in the middle of the room of Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which hang almost in@@ different - that on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 por@@ traits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ far and H@@ air@@ cuts that were sent to you by Chelsea M@@ anning .
&quot; M@@ anning sent the excer@@ pts from the prison of Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth where the former secret service analy@@ st had a 35 @-@ year imprisonment , after they made publicly proclaimed diplomatic reports about the site Wiki@@ Le@@ aks . &quot;
&quot; the new exhibition , opened on 2 August , is called A Bec@@ oming res@@ embl@@ ance ( A suitable simil@@ arity ) . &quot;
&quot; it is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline was united in technology , computer science and art , and M@@ anning , a trans@@ wife and ground@@ breaking Dis@@ si@@ dents , whose condem@@ nation of Barack Obama was transformed when he had only three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by the algorithms , the DNA , which could be extr@@ acted by M@@ anning , and out of the 30 por@@ traits , such as someone can interpret with these gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many ways as they can be interpreted and the in@@ dur@@ ated determ@@ in@@ ism of these interpre@@ tations - but also for identity . &quot;
&quot; M@@ anning , which was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has already talked openly about identification as a woman since their pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced by 20 prosec@@ ution against es@@ pi@@ on@@ ag@@ eg@@ net , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; through the prison its picture was supp@@ ressed , so much that it was just a single photo - a stones , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in the M@@ anning , sitting at an chassis and a plat@@ in@@ blonde per@@ ch carries - with whom they were associated . &quot;
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came to the great success of her 2012 @-@ project &quot; stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions . &quot;
&quot; in this produced the artist &apos;s por@@ traits of stran@@ gers from for@@ ensi@@ c arti@@ facts like c@@ ig@@ et bl@@ eb@@ mel and ch@@ ew@@ ing mi , extr@@ acted the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people might look like . &quot;
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a tim@@ ag@@ azine .
&quot; they led an interview with Chelsea M@@ anning , while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press demonstration of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she was not able to visit this time , and she could not take pictures , therefore they took contact with Chelsea , and asked them whether she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
the artist and their det@@ ain@@ ted M@@ use were inter@@ f@@ aded to un@@ equal Bri@@ dges that were inter@@ changeable in the course of two years .
&quot; they even created one of Sho@@ ili Can@@ ung@@ o illustrated com@@ ic &quot; &quot; Supp@@ lies Images &quot; , &quot; which would fores@@ ee a future in which the president will convert its verdi@@ ct , and it would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; that Obama was actually only few days after the book was released , Mann@@ ings release after seven brutal years in a military in K@@ ans@@ as , was a welcome type of lucky meeting . &quot;
&quot; there is also now at the opening of the exhibition a little deep and star@@ kes , since Donald Tru@@ mp leads a war against inform@@ ants from the Govern@@ ors and against trans@@ gender @-@ troops to find new , al@@ et@@ able paths that it should actually fix , further to ent@@ angl@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; as De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg after the strange Tim@@ ing was asked for all of these things , she said that &quot; things happen at a certain reason . &quot;
&quot; in one on the wall of the gallery , called M@@ anning with her super@@ great signature including ( the &quot; &quot; i &quot; &quot; in her family name is provided with a heart ) an end to the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose basis sex , race , sexuality and culture have been . &quot;
on the facing wall its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ an of C@@ s and GS and As , in Pen@@ cil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hop@@ ed , by integrating the 200 letters ( or Nu@@ kl@@ e@@ oti@@ de to show the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist ) , how amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in biological ways we are all . &quot;
&quot; what people hopefully will participate , is that our gen@@ ome does not take care of who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective them are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , also to see . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , therefore the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition which is stored in an own room , is a page from the above mentioned Com@@ ic @-@ Nov@@ elle . &quot;
it shows M@@ anning as it emerg@@ es with a hand @-@ call in the hand from the disciplines of the United States as king Kong .
&quot; if they face your speech , then they have won . &quot;
&quot; so , never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; the artist said from Philadelphia . &quot;
I &apos;m still going to be go@@ dly when I talk about it .
&quot; M@@ anning , the exhibition has not been seen personally - just as it should be pres@@ cient in the Com@@ ic@@ buch - but if they should do it , then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room of the masks , of their own gen@@ om@@ ic simulation , who together like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this was also focused on how all in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ings St@@ ature ) , where their genetic h@@ ap@@ log@@ groups were written with pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had it on the wall , but I wanted that they feel like a crowd of crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the por@@ traits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted that it feels like a mass movement that feels like Chelsea , as the movement , which also ad@@ fast@@ ed behind her liberation . &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and an employee of Oxford because of killing
&quot; a nationwide human hunt is going on for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford who were sought as susp@@ ects after a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago , with fatal injuries . &quot;
&quot; on Monday were exhibited for Wyn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) Ar@@ rest warran@@ t because of its inn@@ itus participation in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ leau , as the acts of the minist@@ erial court of C@@ ook County . &quot;

&quot; this is now a criminal affair being investigated by the competent authorities , and the North@@ western University is co @-@ operates at this investigation , &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
&quot; a sp@@ okes@@ man of the University and the Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that we are in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help US fund authorities in any conceivable way . &quot;
the statement added that war@@ r@@ ens colleagues were sho@@ cked and want it to be .
&quot; Chief Communications Officer of the police authority of Chicago , Anthony Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi , said , he cri@@ es the susp@@ ects , to face the authorities . &quot;

&quot; Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said , the police got a call of the building managers of the Grand Plaza &apos;s building , who had just received a mysterious tip that had happened in flat 1008 . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; we will conclude the WA@@ DA timetable in the near future &quot; - the Russian vice @-@ re@@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko
&quot; the Russian Viz@@ ep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said , it will not last long until the remaining criteria of the world @-@ anti @-@ mental Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ mental Agency ( R@@ USA@@ DA ) . &quot;
&quot; at a particular stage of fulfillment of the criteria of the roadmap of R@@ USA@@ DA the right to plan , in collaboration with UK@@ AD ( UK anti @-@ doping ) to plan and testing . &quot;
&quot; the WA@@ DA timetable has been updated in this respect , &quot; explained Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
the PM commented the second part of the roadmap of WA@@ DA to comply with the code that describes the criteria for re @-@ fixing of R@@ USA@@ DA and recently published on the website of the organization .
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he contains nothing that could cause concern for Russia . &quot;
&quot; everything was announced , everything is implemented . &quot;
&quot; and the results are presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and the WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; one of the criteria listed in the list mentioned , however , that the Russian anti @-@ brain authorities dis@@ agree that the Russian Anti @-@ doping investigation by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren to inn@@ ate de@@ priv@@ ately funded by the Canadian lawyer in Russian Sport . &quot;
&quot; in relation to the matter said Mut@@ ko : &quot; we lead the investigation by , as our anti @-@ mental system has introduced a mistake . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; there was no state programs , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ kos words voted with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the Head of the independent Russian Anti @-@ doping commission . &quot;

start @-@ ups that will help your organization do not become the next U@@ ber
Amy Ju@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure the happiness in your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up but the surveys did not work .
&quot; answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; and even if you toler@@ ate anon@@ ym@@ ity , some workers mour@@ ned the process . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care Society Ma@@ dison Reed . &quot;
she has called people from outside for help .
&quot; a new race of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is at the wax to help companies find out how their employees feel .
&quot; by creating and licens@@ ing software , which has the specific purpose of measuring the employee &apos;s commitment , it allows companies to perform surveys , special groups and demo@@ graphic groups , employees , and in some cases wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers , to handle the C @-@ Suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; you now have tools like Str@@ ava and Fit@@ Bit for tracking their health , but where is the Fit@@ Bit for your business ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software Analytics tools is used to measure staff engagement . &quot;
salvation said that they have better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t .
&quot; in addition to the Sn@@ ap @-@ surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat map of the company which shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which executives will have low playback results - so you can check out why . &quot;
&quot; to be sure that at the head of the workplace culture you have to stay , so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber that has been involved in scan@@ dal since a former employee sent a blog post , which has spoken an environment of speci@@ fic@@ tions , in those who have spoken to pun@@ ished . &quot;
this desire for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t is this desire for an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
&quot; the Global Governance , regulation and Compliance sector might have 2020 more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion value , according to the funded technical site Let &apos;s talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent bad behavior and identify , saw an asc@@ ending interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the midst of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
u@@ ber has recently filed as a client .
&quot; like G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ cent companies tailor made custom made of pul@@ ses , gather confidential answers in real time and view the warmth of your problem areas . &quot;
it also offers an anonymous SMS @-@ hot@@ line with the staff of bad behavior .
&quot; and if the main business leader is involved , complaints directly to the Supervisory Board . &quot;
&quot; the court of public opinion has recorded the Reg@@ ulators , &quot; said Patrick Quin@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; if a company is found that his staff is not treated poor@@ ly or beha@@ ves un@@ eth@@ ically , it can experience precious consequences by consumers @-@ boy@@ cot@@ t , worker @-@ flu@@ x and Kl@@ agen , said Quin@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant @-@ chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations , conver@@ cent for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and methods and have a simple way to reach their corporate headquarters . &quot;
&quot; earlier , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or e @-@ mail for the corporate central , a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often an intim@@ i@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el , who said , there was no good opportunity to follow the discomfort of employees . &quot;
&quot; now since the company conver@@ cent exc@@ uses , problems that have previously identified by managers who have been hidden in offices in towns or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or impro@@ per practitioner . &quot;
&quot; I can closer to this holistic , 360 degree view of the experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who runs the risk Management Group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment , legal disputes . &quot;
&quot; companies began to take ethics , values and staff engagement in 2002 , after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen was coll@@ ap@@ sed due to ethical violations by the En@@ ron @-@ Sk@@ an@@ dal , said Quin@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; but it took , until the &quot; Social Media came to their right &quot; , &quot; that companies recognized that you could not prevent that their dirty laundry online . &quot;
&quot; prior to the use of technology for the surveillance of ethics , people used hope as a strategy &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; both G@@ lin@@ t as well as Conver@@ cent offer your software as a service , and loaded the company with recur@@ ring fees for the use of their products . &quot;
it is a business model and an opportunity to find the approval of Venture Capital Invest@@ ors that supports both start @-@ ups .
conver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February of firms such as Sap@@ phire Ventures and T@@ ola Capital with which the entire capital has been raised to $ 47 million .
&quot; $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought its entire financing to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; these investments are hardly surprising , given the networked nature of companies , culture and venture Capital . &quot;
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s staff can expect more of their jobs than before .
in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only moderate .
employees want the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated and that you will give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; when people are happy to be in a company that heard their voices , and that the work you do , then make them feel stronger to make this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , vice president of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Employ@@ ee Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which is both conver@@ cent as well as g@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
investors reach return when their portfolio companies are well running . company run good when employees work and eng@@ aging .
&quot; if the analytics tools of third promise , dedication and the use of employees is no wonder that you will find assistance . &quot;
the data on staff engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture is important .
but the data are us@@ eless if the st@@ ew@@ ards of a company does not take action .
&quot; in fact , if a company asks employee after your feedback , it may have an expect@@ ation that change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the change is not fast enough , or not at all , this can be dis@@ appointments and dec@@ eptions . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must have prepared to have 4,000 conversations , said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , the company who have to rely on the collecting data . &quot;
&quot; for if you do not follow staff members , &quot; Do you really hear me really ? &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; and whom you do not take care of , why should I ? &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ dison Reed , who runs now monthly employees , was able to invite actions on the same day when a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t , so salvation . &quot;
&quot; and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was characterized by the quick@@ ness of decision making and quality of communication , able to organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to tackle the problems . &quot;
&quot; in Ruby Tuesday , the company receives new insights about the staff , and it hopes that in a long run that leads to a better bond of workers in a sector , which is known for high turnover . &quot;
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you lose also customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , then you will lose business . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A remo@@ ves the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the Bru@@ ins
it runs on 23 clock when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA @-@ foot@@ ball@@ ers are talking on one side of the new exercise fields of the team on campus .
some have moved their tri@@ cky parts and show the back full of swe@@ at from the first day of training .
for a good part of the team this unusual minute is a mid@@ day break .
players who are invited to the summer courses are returning after the thir@@ sty exercise to their final test before they return the next morning at 6 : 30 am to the water@@ man Football Center .
&quot; that is for the guys the next three days a genuine staircase , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before Monday to Tuesday . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminated two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of players and she has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore the first three sessions of U@@ C@@ LA should begin at 19 : 15 PM in order to meet the already fully packed time plans of the player .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the brood at the beginning of the Camp@@ s was postpon@@ ed nearly one week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six season hours in West@@ wood practical exercises .
they should hold 18 exercises in the course of August 18 exercises . 20 before the start of formal game preparations for their pre@@ lu@@ de against Texas A &amp; M in September .
&quot; Mor@@ a said that he calls the rules of N@@ CA@@ A suppor@@ tive , even if they add the busy routes of the player a further point . &quot;
&quot; we place this enormous burden three or four days on them , and it is very challenging , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they simply pushed it @-@ pressed , they plac@@ ings herself , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think once we come up to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ C@@ LA will finish its practices once the camp is termin@@ ated , what given the clear back@@ lines of its fields from an adjacent parking and adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of an up@@ scale class that is already pointed with foot@@ prints , which will be a protective network behind a tor@@ p@@ ony and no light task . &quot;
&quot; brood @-@ players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a spatial one that could give it a problem once these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it &apos;s not far fet@@ ched that people can rent a room and then setting up a exercise . &quot;
if you have the video and from a exercise it is a fairly good deal .
&quot; but we have security forces , and we have safety forces on parking place 8 . &quot;
we will do the best with what we have .
so I am not doing so too big .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit news
&quot; Facebook wants to send more potential articles with Fal@@ sch@@ usions on fac@@ ebook , and showing their results under the original contribution , then the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of its efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News . &quot;
&quot; the company said in an opinion on its website that it will begin using any updated machine methods , to identify possible fal@@ seh@@ oods and to send it at fact , which may display results of the fact inspection from the original article . &quot;
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the major distribution points for so called F@@ ake news of which many believe they have also influenced the US presidential elections 2016 .
&quot; the issue has also become a major political issue , whereas the French voters were floo@@ ded with false histor@@ ies in May with false histor@@ ies , and Germany now supports a plan , according to the social media networks to be pun@@ ished , h@@ asser@@ ted post@@ ings like before the elections there in September quickly . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate explanation in German that in the US , France , the Netherlands and Germany started a test of new facts check . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the realization , which stories of Fak@@ uma will be challenged , the people want more context to manage out decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara Su , Product man@@ ag@@ ress for Facebook @-@ News in a blog . &quot;
&quot; it added that Facebook will continue to test the feature &quot; &quot; in connection &quot; &quot; and to other changes to his news feed to decrease wrong messages . &quot;
creating a Com@@ ic @-@ RO@@ MAN@@ S : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past the small Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ he and 1980 @-@ he has been a hat@@ ch .
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has seen 700 years of turbul@@ ent history of its cozy seat in the ir@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now available to inspiration for a graphical novel by Jam@@ ie Rhodes , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I find it so nice to look at the manuscript from someone who is dead for 300 years , &quot; he says . &quot;
what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England &apos;s thr@@ illing over time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families that illustrated in Scot@@ ney . every story was illustrated by another , upcoming British artist , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isa@@ bel Gre@@ enberg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book by Rhodes , which is based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was unexpected . &quot;
&quot; I have only responded to the thum@@ b print on the side of a letter , written by a double @-@ bed in the 1700 &apos;s years , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; that is his thum@@ b print ! &quot;
&quot; and letters are still sm@@ elled to smoke , because then there was a fire because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect , as if he himself did . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
&quot; for someone who is so with old papers is that he will be supported by National Trust and the Arts Council England ( &quot; &quot; To be honest : I have a little exagger@@ ated &quot; ) , this seems to be everything too beautiful to be true . &quot;
&quot; Rhodes spent his days to explore the vi@@ kt@@ ori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle to study the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosity of the chat@@ eau on the walls and the bottles , the centuries spent in the dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he emig@@ rated by the terrain and the ruins of the old castle , and spoke with Land@@ sc@@ rub@@ bers , gardening , and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he d@@ rank whis@@ key and started to write . &quot;
&quot; the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown since the National Trust received only the full access until the last , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died . &quot;
&quot; when Rhodes a decade later , the employees began to take care of the archive , which he said than &quot; hundreds of years , in which arist@@ ocr@@ ats said &quot; Oh , wir@@ f it on the attic . &quot;
&quot; diary , letters from the time of English sens@@ ations , cards , who poss@@ essed , who poss@@ essed : &quot; &quot; you could be boring , &quot; &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to have fought the two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let everything go his gang ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection will use the castle as a starting point to view the English story , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which leaves a man who built the newly built castle to connect to the farmhouse of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record from a tur@@ mo@@ il that joined 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book with the title &apos; K@@ nigh@@ tly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; says Rhodes . &quot;
&quot; the farm was started in this area and I thought , an insurrection was a good beginning . &quot;
perhaps the two are connected ? &quot;
&quot; other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it seven years during the English Reformation . &quot;
&quot; or &apos; The Sm@@ ug@@ gler &apos; , in which the sm@@ ug@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rell from the 18th century is represented by his own identity by filled a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery , which was only years later than his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; the Dar@@ rel@@ ls are Rhodes &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentlemen seemed to be able cro@@ oks to always make debt and spend money for things that they could not afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell men dro@@ ught their school@@ boy , by getting rich ancient women married - I imagine them as a he@@ ap @-@ looking l@@ ender guys , with a talent to promote emp@@ owerment . &quot;
&quot; after the end of his efforts in the castle , Rhodes in search of other unique write experiences . &quot;
&quot; he has had a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a Com@@ ic @-@ Roman above El@@ is@@ än@@ m@@ ä@@ ki behind him , the terrain of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since then returned from nature back again . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back again , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like : &quot; Oh , now I have to be done with the twi@@ sted life again . &quot;
campaign launched : more than 300 years old Marien@@ chapel in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf covered
&quot; with the envel@@ oping of the old Marien@@ chapel in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the City of Bad Honnef was launched on Friday its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau of Thursday ) . &quot;
&quot; still to Thursday , Mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team want to hold the logo and slogan . &quot;
at the end of August it is meant to be a highlight of the campaign on the island of Graf@@ en@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
or ? &quot; ask the creators of the action since yesterday on the poster of the Rh@@ en@@ dor@@ fer chapel .
&quot; we think that ( obviously ! ) does not really mean , write them on her yesterday . &quot;
&quot; but , we use this measure to gain your attention . &quot;
and to make clear that man@@ ches is better than it seems .
&quot; basically , we are the firm conviction that we as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizens know about the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city very well . &quot;
&quot; when action you go to more than &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it is called further . &quot;
&quot; it is valid to form@@ ulate an all @-@ ste@@ al promise , which gives the city an un@@ mist@@ ak@@ able pan@@ demic . &quot;
finally she stand in competition with other municipalities .
a central five @-@ digit amount will be charged the city of Bad Honnef her new roof @-@ brand and the campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erd@@ og@@ an &apos;s fear of the army
&quot; each year at the beginning of August , in Ankara of the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) via P@@ ensi@@ on@@ ations and transpor@@ ts in Off@@ iz@@ ation@@ sk@@ or@@ ps . &quot;
so this week .
at first sight a normal operation .
&quot; however , nothing is routine by Turkish forces , one year after the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; the session did not take place in the building of the General Staff , as formerly , but in the headquarters of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; following the discussions under the presidency of the Government now also the five Vice @-@ ep@@ re@@ ers as well as the Minister of Defence , Home , Justice and External Action . &quot;
the civilians in Y@@ AS were in abundance .
the government moves to the military in the military .
&quot; Direc@@ tor@@ ch Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the comm@@ anders of the army , of air @-@ workers and nav@@ y were buried . &quot;
since the failed cou@@ p has consolidated Erd@@ og@@ an 169 of the 326 gener@@ als and Admir@@ als .
&quot; more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of the cultivated connections to the movement of exile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erd@@ og@@ an as a Wi@@ re@@ trac@@ er of the coup . &quot;
486 people who have been involved directly at the coup attempt has been participating in Ankara for this week .
&quot; already on the day after the coup Erd@@ og@@ an the overthrow called &quot; &quot; God &quot; , &quot; as he had given him the opportunity to clean the armed forces &quot; . &quot; &quot;
but is Erd@@ og@@ an the army really under control ?
&quot; in late February the newspaper &quot; &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; &quot; published an article with the heading &quot; discomfort within the military @-@ head@@ quarter . &quot;
&quot; in the General Staff shall give more concerns due to an increasing &quot; &quot; Islam@@ ism &quot; &quot; of the army , who manifest@@ ing himself in the lifting of the head@@ sc@@ ch@@ ban for Sol@@ dat@@ ers , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
the wholes@@ ale guards on the army and the security forces continues .
&quot; in the middle of July Erd@@ og@@ an per decre@@ e further 73@@ 95 citizenship , including 23@@ 03 Poli@@ zi@@ sts and 546 soldiers . &quot;
it seemed to be the Erd@@ og@@ an of the military .
the gener@@ als g@@ old sooner than the actual men of the country .
three pairs of put@@ ted them under appeal to their role as gu@@ ardian of the world@@ ly state .
&quot; after his election in 2002 , Erd@@ og@@ an &apos;s power to go back to the power of the military step by step back , not least under appeal to the reform of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say Erd@@ og@@ an t@@ ear targeted a Islam@@ ist of the armed forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; Voc@@ al Europe &quot; , a name not so @-@ called officer , who sought after the coup attempt out of fear of persecution abroad , the Turkish army will be in a few years &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and sal@@ af@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; to meet that , such a development could not leave the n@@ ato . &quot;
&quot; in the case , there is any doubt in the alliance to inf@@ ants doubt on the use of the Turkish army . &quot;
&quot; the management structures and operational capabilities are &quot; weak@@ ened &quot; , &quot; say N@@ ato diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
&quot; there will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of Green Card , said President Donald Tru@@ mp , cited by the media . &quot;
&quot; it looks to lower the legal immigrants in 50.000 per year , more str@@ ingent regulations for obtaining visa for a temporary work@@ permit and limitations for families @-@ oriented visa . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ can and supported by the President .
the legisl@@ ature is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; this law will decrease poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers , and will do this by changing the US the way the citizens from other European countries will be printed . &quot;
the law will prevent the chains migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will come to the candidates to learn English , who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that our economy will be good , &quot; said Tru@@ mp , cited by the American media . &quot;
Ministry will Sur@@ round@@ ing circuit for Rac@@ ec@@ ycle
&quot; over the past few months , we have been disp@@ uted over the future of the Rac@@ eh@@ utt@@ les over the past few months - now it should go very quickly . &quot;
&quot; before the end of the year will be on the mar@@ o@@ des track , on which the tourist track is going to be built . &quot;
&quot; to secure the future of the Rac@@ ec@@ utt@@ les in the long term , we shall start working on the track according to the information of the Ministry of Transport . &quot;
&quot; by making the decision to order and rehabilitation the route to Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Rac@@ ec@@ g , the country is especially interested in the tourism &quot; , &quot; declared Verkehrs@@ verb@@ secret@@ ary Klaus S@@ ühl on Friday in Erfurt . &quot;
the cost of maintenance of the circuit is approximately 2.5 million euros .
&quot; from this total amount , the country takes over 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , based on whose basis the shuttle must also be ordered in the future from the country , I will definitely be definitive , explained S@@ ühl . &quot;
the Ministry and the South@@ th@@ ür@@ ingen train as an operator had already been agreed upon the technical details .
&quot; thus the timetable , the vehicles used and quality standards are tr@@ aded , &quot; said S@@ ühl . &quot;
the planned contract between the Ministry and the Railway Society will be closed for a period of eleven years .
thus the rac@@ tor Shuttle service to be ordered on December 2017 .
the racing bike @-@ shuttle is one of the most popular railway connection between the railway stations of Il@@ men@@ au and Rac@@ ec@@ g .
&quot; over the past few months , during the course of a pilot &apos;s operation was tested whether the circuit is used by plenty of many people to order them back in the future . &quot;
the route is also extremely strong in parts .
the rise of sex robot is real and we ought to worry about
&quot; just as you thought that it cannot be crazy 2017 , a new report comes about technological developments in the field of sex robot . &quot;
yes indeed .
sex robots are currently a big deal .
&quot; recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for responsible Robotics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robot@@ ic robots in the next five to ten years . &quot;
&quot; according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , em@@ eri@@ ter Professor of Robotics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must start taking their rise seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye @-@ color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of F@@ ing@@ ern@@ ag@@ el . &quot;
&quot; people think about them funny , but the businesses deliver every amount of it and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; said Mr. Shar@@ key on the release of his new report . &quot;
modern sex doll@@ s have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robot@@ ic partners with a si@@ licon brick that feels warm - with deliber@@ ately human reactions that can be achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can also adjust its robot according to his beliefs , and select everything from the eye @-@ color of the robot about the form of ni@@ p@@ ples up to the type or the color of his fingers . &quot;
&quot; but it is still disturbing , as many robots possess the &quot; personalities , &quot; which would be a Step@@ ford woman in a progressive way . &quot;
modern sex @-@ doll@@ s have turned on robots with a si@@ licon skin .
&quot; the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robots makes it possible for example to adapt its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing like e.g. &apos; ch@@ tern@@ ity . &quot;
and then there is still the root of True Compan@@ ion developed Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robots with pre @-@ programmed personalities as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which con@@ veys the impression of the scene and &quot; Wild Wend@@ y &quot; with a &quot; advent@@ urous personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality , which is adapted to your personality as good as possible , &quot; warm@@ ed the site of True Compan@@ ion . &quot;
&quot; like them , what you like , and they don &apos;t like what you may not like , etc . &quot;
she also has their m@@ oods over the day - just like real people !
&quot; it can be tired , fixed on conversation or she can &quot; &quot; be &quot; &quot; in mood ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robot - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the under@@ ne@@ sting feminine characteristics , the propor@@ tions in r@@ ape , if one goes one step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means here : rel@@ ap@@ ing ) Far@@ rah goes , be@@ rest@@ less a most . &quot;
&quot; on his site True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men . &quot;
&quot; if women ( si@@ c ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why men then do not have Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; is it on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just a different sex tool . &quot;
their creation and increasing refin@@ ement point out a little dar@@ ker and deeper understanding in our culture to a withdrawal from the Ideal for gender equality towards sex with submission as optional addition .
&quot; most men of course will not hold any sex robots , and while the FR@@ R notes its increasing popularity , they remain pro@@ visional on the edge of consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what can se@@ oo@@ zes out of the border zones , in relation to the spirit of the time , in which we live , very educational . &quot;
&quot; and many people are not wei@@ rd or ob@@ li@@ ous , until they present their permission to this market . &quot;
&quot; there is nevertheless a certain transi@@ tions , that these highly developed sex robots are in a time to dive in which the rights of women are threatened around the world , in which there is one president in the White House , who has under@@ mine women sexually attacked . &quot;
&quot; the aw@@ ful aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s Tale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the Mag@@ d &apos; ) are not the graphical images , the trou@@ bled body and the engra@@ ved eye , but how realistic this vision works . &quot;
the Republic of Gilead is a leap but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap .
the goal behind these sex robot is to establish a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( if also with por@@ no@@ star propor@@ tions ) .
their buil@@ ders want to feel more humane that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; but , brought to the point when it comes to its &quot; people , &quot; the robots are not a real women . &quot;
they cannot separate or simply walk away from her companion .
&quot; they have no placement or a background of history , nothing , what happened on independence or anything , which might distur@@ b the imagination of total sub@@ jug@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in other words , you are f@@ ake slaves . &quot;
or to express it in the expression of 2017 : ma@@ ids
Tru@@ mp@@ s great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to the in@@ compreh@@ ension of the healthy human being
&quot; it has become a bin@@ der of the Tru@@ mp @-@ era that has polari@@ zed the political divisions , who have polar@@ ised the U.S. elect@@ or@@ ate , also families in small format . &quot;
around Christmas and Ern@@ t@@ ed@@ ank@@ fest there were in the USA newspapers with advice on how to cope with the hor@@ ror of Tru@@ mp &apos;s relative .
we are all alleg@@ edly directed to all of us to let our filter bub@@ bles .
&quot; less noticed is the power of Tru@@ mp@@ s , families together . &quot;
&quot; I are considering this , because my C@@ ous@@ ine , a left @-@ wing ring , who lives in Chicago and has long been employed with the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family , who has visited this week in New York for a long time . &quot;
it rem@@ inded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
&quot; with Tru@@ mp in the White House everyone knows who knows them , including the Republi@@ can kind@@ red , with which they fought for decades , suddenly and totally peculi@@ ar on the same side . &quot;
&quot; for the dining table , this certainly is a good thing , but it falls me in another connection that this also brings considerable risks with itself . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tru@@ mp , but the upcoming effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right . &quot;
&quot; when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and Tru@@ mp , we refer to the gr@@ assy possibility that the kitt@@ ens of one day will no longer reach us . &quot;
&quot; however , there is a still sc@@ rubber @-@ time scenario , in the Tru@@ mp Rep@@ ublic@@ ans of the right wing &quot; &quot; norm@@ alizes in comparison to his standards suddenly as an in@@ compreh@@ ension of den@@ ial . &quot;
&quot; I find myself nowadays by an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s Com@@ neys , the dog on the auto@@ da@@ ch , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax statement looked ) - both compared to Tru@@ mp in fact , one as very mild stra@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; when Tru@@ mp goes , the next candidate of rep@@ ublic@@ ans must be spirit@@ ually healthy to qualify as an im@@ meas@@ ur@@ ably improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my C@@ ous@@ ine in the city was , we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park , the largest of the Car@@ uss@@ ar of New York City Department , and the best three dollars which one can spend in the city if you do not have caffeine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass design on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are kn@@ ur@@ red and the animals are twi@@ sted to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate @-@ per@@ ing music con@@ veys this in a reasonably sensible way . &quot;
&quot; so many ar@@ is@@ ees of a city dis@@ ap@@ point : the views of high buildings are old , the sky@@ lines are becoming too familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice . &quot;
&quot; fifth year later , and I am still not entirely over the day , when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed no Swiss Cottage - the theme @-@ pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage does not count - but a big roundabout in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; the Central Park @-@ carousel is still a strange magical experience , since here two two years old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ er years can go on it and all have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could have been able to rate the carousel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one has asked him . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced to evaluate my &quot; &quot; experience &quot; &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before leaving my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to check the rating with a 15 % ti@@ pping money - this in order to buy something about the counter . &quot;
&quot; this not only leads to a slow@@ ing of what actually should be a neutral exchange , but also exercise pressure on the server to bring personality to a situation where no need is required . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the Kauf@@ haus stood ap@@ ologi@@ zing , while I tired the experience to submit my credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with Bre@@ ada@@ che from prison to hospital
Pist@@ ori@@ us has left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time .
&quot; last year he was brought to the hospital because of the treatment of cuts to his hand , which he suffered the prison authorities according to a case in his cell . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us was condemned to a appeal of the prosec@@ ut@@ ors to a first Tot@@ ally .
he k@@ iller ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early hours of the Valentine &apos;s Day 2013 by giving them several times through a door of toil@@ et@@ ries in his house in Pre@@ toria on them .
&quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us hop@@ eful that he kept his girlfriend for a nights inv@@ aders , who hidden in the c@@ ab . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention to appeal this time against the six @-@ year imprisonment sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , from whom they say it is too high . &quot;
&quot; the nation@@ als of prosec@@ ution said that they will be able to raise the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the decision could be heard this year . &quot;
&quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us runs danger that its punishment is increased to 15 years , when prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful . &quot;
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as Bauer Arnold a strange egg can be found
&quot; as the last of the flower schools , the neighborhoods of F@@ tzen and E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen were released to the holidays and to the leading schools . &quot;
&quot; in the future , three of the kid@@ n@@ ine@@ ers go to the Gymnasium , four to the real school . &quot;

&quot; Bauer Arnold found a distinctive egg , and caused it out of his chicken . &quot;
&quot; instead of a ch@@ ickens , a little eag@@ le came out . &quot;
&quot; but the hope to make out of him a chicken , the eag@@ le sm@@ elled on a high mountain its wings and escap@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; after that , the classes showed three and four in the study of Yv@@ onne Frank a ch@@ ickens . &quot;
&quot; h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young go@@ d@@ les , the cylinder tru@@ sts in order to w@@ ager the bet . &quot;
&quot; Adler stand for the integration , said Schul@@ der Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te . &quot;
&quot; young people might be different than the other young animals ( ch@@ icks ) , but they belon@@ ged to this . &quot;
but he will never be like a chicken .
his purpose is to be free .
they wished every quad@@ rup@@ ture that he feels in his new school .
&quot; it followed the colleagues about the colleagues , the former school leader Michael Müller , who is always jumping again at school @-@ level , and the parent companies . &quot;
the che@@ ek time is now over ; declared class teacher Sophia Schu@@ macher .
&quot; they leave their students after two years of instruction only very well , because it had been a really great time . &quot;
&quot; finally , you can rely on the t@@ onal stones . &quot;
&quot; at the end , all students left a song of summer time and holiday season . &quot;
it broke out great joy with the children .
for the new school year eight Initi@@ ators are already registered .
two Bulg@@ arians due to illegal camping in Greece
&quot; two Bulg@@ arians were det@@ ained because of illegal camp@@ ings in Greece , divided the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , cited by television . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of August 1 , Si@@ th@@ onia was arrested by the police a group of illegal people , including the two Bulg@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; on the same day they were released , while there is currently an investigation . &quot;
&quot; the State Department reported b@@ TV , that the Bulg@@ arians were later released . &quot;

the controls will continue throughout the season .
the Ministry said that the court can assign a money sentence .
software update for diesel vehicles : what the people concerned must know
how exactly is the software update instead of ?
need diesel drivers take part in the action ?
the most important questions and answers in overview .
&quot; at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group software updates are offered for a total of around 5,@@ 3 million cars . &quot;
they should improve the exhaust behaviour of cars of the emission classes Euro 5 and partially euros 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ Diesel or worse are exemp@@ t from it .
Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in from ACE car Club Europa are assess@@ ments :
is the new action compulsory ?
&quot; no , the latest software updates are voluntary . &quot;
&quot; the oblig@@ atory updates previously only apply to vehicles , the Schum@@ b software , &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
their retro@@ fitting has arranged the power station ( KBA ) .
how and when are customers informed about updates ?
&quot; the makers have announced a timely implementation in the next months , but still not an exact date . &quot;
Daimler has told everyone involved .
&quot; if there is an inspection , this will be done in their context . &quot;
how long does the conver@@ sions go in total ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; means S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
the state &apos;s commitment from the commitment of the manufacturer as well as from the political pressure .
&quot; because we have seen , voluntarily the car manufacturers do not act on the subject of the environment so far . &quot;
how long will the update last ?

the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the gl@@ am@@ our@@ able events in Washington .
the first prize @-@ giving under President Tru@@ mp promises to become political .
one of the winners will not come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) gets first Rap@@ per one of the cov@@ eted awards of the prestigious Kennedy Center .
&quot; like the cultural policies on Thursday announced this year also a singer of Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ on@@ el Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) as well as the cho@@ reo@@ grapher Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the television producer Norman L@@ ear ( 95 ) . &quot;
the awards will be handed over from the beginning of December .
&quot; traditionally , U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp will run a welcome and participate together with his wife Mel@@ ania an der . &quot;
the pro@@ cal TV @-@ series well @-@ known lau@@ re@@ ates L@@ ear announced that it already announced to take part in the g@@ ala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the New York Times &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; this Presidency has decided to negl@@ ect the arts and human rights - even to depri@@ ve them the means - and that bur@@ dens me . &quot;
&quot; the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an stressed , she will use the conversation with Tru@@ mp to explain their views . &quot;
&quot; after the former president John F. Kennedy , Kennedy @-@ Center is the largest cultural hub in the U.S. capital . &quot;
&quot; to the former prize @-@ makers count Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Franklin , Robert De N@@ iro , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing . &quot;
we make the city li@@ vable
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadtbauatelier , going back in the coming year . &quot;
the job is already written - suitable candidates are r@@ ary .
for 31 years W@@ acker is w@@ masters .
and the work is still great fun as he im@@ part@@ ed in the presses .
&quot; he reports from varied , but also demanding tasks that wait for its successor . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , it doesn &apos;t wonder that so far no application does not fill the application profile . &quot;
the city is looking for the next time a architect or Bau@@ ingenie@@ ur .
this is how it should be in compliance with the regular notice of dism@@ iss@@ al - still enough time for writing .
&quot; since Has@@ l@@ ach , for the administration of the Community as a sub@@ ordin@@ ator authority , the applic@@ ant has to be defined . &quot;
for this function I want to keep the city any case .
&quot; if they cannot fill out this form , the citizen would need to take care of to Off@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; the close proximity to the city and itself is important , says W@@ acker , who speaks of a good business atmosphere , as well as good mood between authority and citizens . &quot;
&quot; in more than 30 years in office , some important projects have accumulated over the W@@ acker with pride . &quot;
&quot; we do the city alive , &quot; it is safe for the construction and its employees . &quot;
but also in the future varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ eder @-@ Centre are about .
the kin@@ z@@ ig@@ bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed also the stadium is still subject .
&quot; the latter alone is to be@@ ech around 1.5 million euros with some 1.5 million euros , &quot; when we do &quot; s right &quot; , &quot; appreci@@ ates W@@ acker . &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my successor . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
&quot; creative , be available for the master @-@ master room area . &quot;
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s own Bau@@ hof and gar@@ den@@ ers could be quite flexible to react .
&quot; you can move much &quot; , &quot; so w@@ acker , and the design of the founders are often mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; since the old town as an ensemble among the monument protection stands , it is important to have an eye for it , what rein@@ forcement , if new buildings are approved , stres@@ sing the separ@@ ating town . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the Stadtbauatelier will be high responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is Bau@@ builder , &quot; in the end everything runs here over my table . &quot;
&quot; for assistance and coordination , he can count on many years of employees : Markus Neu@@ maier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been doing so Manfred Schön@@ er ( deep @-@ building ) for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; also that his successor is long , wishes W@@ acker : &quot; we are looking for someone who really have been identified with the place and want to stay . &quot;
&quot; continuity is not only important for a good farm , but also for the further design of the city . &quot;
&quot; who wants to inher@@ it Roland W@@ acker , should sign up for information about the city of Has@@ l@@ ach , as a graduate studies or Bachelor &apos;s degree in architecture and have good expertise in the fields of design and construction . &quot;
&quot; the town of construction , high@@ - and deep @-@ building , building planning , gra@@ under@@ ing matters , administration of urban property , urban business owners with Bau@@ hof and town gar@@ den@@ ers , as well as Lower Civil Code , including monument protection . &quot;
bicycle on the lines thrown : southern path locked
&quot; according to the police , the previously un@@ known perpet@@ r@@ ator had thrown over the blue bicycle from the track @-@ over in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener street ( B@@ 116 ) . &quot;
&quot; these were so badly damaged , that the rise of goods had to be lifted . &quot;
the investig@@ ators go from two male times and look for the night hours after them .
near the Tat@@ ort by witnesses had been a ro@@ ky sco@@ oter and a bike driver has been observed .
&quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ bu@@ ben@@ st@@ reich , &quot; said Ö@@ BB @-@ chairman Christoph Pos@@ ch to the APA . &quot;
the or the perpet@@ rators had raised themselves in great danger and also threat@@ ening the traffic .
&quot; in addition to the damage to the Lo@@ k and the plant , as well as the delay of rail , and the costs for rail transport may also be raised to the perpet@@ rators . &quot;
&quot; a total of whether to go from a &quot; significant &quot; sum , &quot; said the speaker . &quot;
the damage was again fixed on Friday afternoon , the railway transport on the south @-@ route could be guided without a disability . &quot;
&quot; barely ten Person@@ alities were Friday morning , two of them are frau@@ dul@@ ent of traffic . &quot;
&quot; Gü@@ ter@@ ies fell not from , they had no delay . &quot;
according to Ö@@ BB @-@ chairman Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be exchanged at about 200 meters of upper lines .
isol@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help to all@@ evi@@ ate IB@@ D ( infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory intest@@ inal diseases ) .
red meat and chocolate can sound for your diges@@ tive system like a nigh@@ tm@@ are .
&quot; but a new study claims the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and milk products , the symptoms of patients could all@@ evi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory intest@@ inal diseases . &quot;
&quot; the incur@@ able state that affects approximately 1,@@ 3 million and in the United Kingdom 300@@ .000 , caused by Mag@@ en@@ kr@@ amps and blood , recur@@ rent or bloo@@ dy diar@@ rhe@@ a , weight loss and extreme fatigue . &quot;
&quot; while those affected is normally to avoid flesh and dairy products , researchers found researchers at the Wash@@ ing@@ toner University , that the essential amino acid pr@@ yp@@ top@@ han found to contribute to promoting immune cells that promote an toler@@ ant intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; the introductory resear@@ cher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , declared that immun@@ ology at the gut pat@@ rol , to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes , which hide themselves in the food , not into the body . &quot;
&quot; cells , the im@@ itation are , infl@@ amm@@ ation , are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without vulnerable fabric . &quot;
&quot; if the balance is too far towards infl@@ amm@@ ation , it can result in a infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory intest@@ inal diseases . &quot;
in experiments was observed that a kind of tolerance injury is found in mice that occurs a certain bacter@@ ium in their bow@@ els .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the blocks of proteins - to dis@@ solve the appearance of the cells .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; &quot; we have a link between a bacterial and Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the intest@@ ine micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the mice in their food , the more they had these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and one at Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han rich foods toler@@ ant , less infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory Dar@@ mm@@ ili@@ eus supports , if the same system also ac@@ qui@@ res the same system . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ do@@ or@@ and@@ in Dr. Luisa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an under@@ sear@@ ched a kind of immune cell that encourages the tolerance , when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but a different group of same trunk that was separated but separated . &quot;
&quot; they assumed that the difference with the intest@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ omes of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and mushrooms , which usually live in the stomach @-@ intest@@ inal tract . &quot;
the har@@ ness of the mice have been DNA @-@ sequ@@ encing and there were six bacterial species present in the mice with the immune cells but without them missing in the mice .
&quot; mice were raised in a ster@@ ile environment , so that they were not developed a intest@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not developed this kind of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells . &quot;
&quot; to understand how the bacteria re@@ acting on the immune system , the researchers L. reu@@ ter@@ i would grow in a fluid and then over@@ led small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ri@@ pe immune cells that were isolated from the mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed into the toler@@ ant cells .
&quot; when the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ Met@@ abol@@ ism that is known as In@@ dol @-@ 3 @-@ Mil@@ k . &quot;
&quot; if the researchers have doubled the quantity of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the for@@ age of mice double , the number of such cells have been hal@@ ved by about 50 percent , but if the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ values were hal@@ ved , s@@ ank the number of cells by half . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an said that people have the same toler@@ ant cells such as mice , and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i protected in our stomach @-@ intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ out@@ products made of L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in people like in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory intest@@ inal diseases . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; The development of these cells is probably something that we would like to promote , since these cells control infl@@ amm@@ ations on the internal surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot;
potentially can lead high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i to an extension of this population . &quot;
&quot; Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic has committed a &quot; genius &quot; &quot;
&quot; at Manchester United has signed with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ field @-@ player at the Mit@@ tw@@ och@@ et had his debut against S@@ amp@@ dor@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million pounds signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game , before the UEF@@ A @-@ Super Madrid begins on Tuesday , and impressive in the neck @-@ role , as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira following popularity . &quot;
&quot; MAT@@ IC was however excluded from the prepar@@ atory Asia @-@ tour of the blues and managed just 45 minutes , which he had to improve the M@@ our@@ in@@ ho before the start of the Premier League season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
we will help him sooner than later .
&quot; alongside M@@ atic start@@ led also Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u at Avi@@ va @-@ Stadium , as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho its start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season . &quot;
&quot; the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho yet wished for three more new acquis@@ itions , but he insi@@ sted that the club already has done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to meet three of his four priority news@@ letters . &quot;
&quot; three of four to get , thank you for the association , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four , but they have given great difficulty . &quot;
Boeing &quot; m@@ alt &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft Boeing has made the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers in the sky .
&quot; the pil@@ ots flew from Seattle in US state Washington , but the drawing started in Marqu@@ ette in US state of Michigan , and moved to the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers over the US , which are several thousand kilometers . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the ra@@ dar sh@@ iel@@ ding was the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers .
the whole thing was a per@@ sever@@ able test for new engines .
Boeing had previously made such advertising earlier .
&quot; so the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing @-@ Logo in heaven was painted . &quot;
&quot; new draft for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem &quot;
&quot; as the wind revol@@ ves : as Sig@@ mar Gabriel nor SPD &apos;s boss , the Social @-@ Democratic Prime Minister was always facing a certain concern to Berlin . &quot;
&quot; only do not cause interference from the party central , just no counter @-@ wind from the covenant - so lau@@ gh the most important desire of the elect@@ oral struggles . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz , the party has changed the fundamentally changed . &quot;
&quot; since then , the employees from the Willy Brandt @-@ House observe the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals . &quot;
what Mr Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in the approach .
there were deep bel@@ ong@@ ings .
and indeed one after the other .
the CD@@ U @-@ CD@@ U sees a gener@@ ic signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of SPD and Gre@@ ens after a surprisingly end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony .
&quot; this shows once more : red @-@ green can simply not be reliable , &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber the editor of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
the surprising Fr@@ ac@@ tion@@ ing of a Green vote has pl@@ ung@@ ed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months prior to the day@@ time elections the red @-@ green coalition makes its red @-@ vote majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Gre@@ ens of the Gre@@ at@@ leader Michael Kell@@ ner asked the Ab@@ tr@@ ün@@ del Nieder@@ s@@ ächs@@ ische greenery El@@ ke T@@ ort requested to return their mandate .
the over@@ step to the CD@@ U means a clear adjustment of the cro@@ wing .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ ehr@@ er must immediately return their mandate , &quot; said the federal business leader and election of the Gre@@ ens of the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; this must however not be true , sigh@@ ing a SPD elect@@ oral elect@@ oral campaigns as on the Friday morning the new Hi@@ ob@@ s@@ bot@@ le reaches the party central . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands after crossing the green Members El@@ ke T@@ our@@ to CD@@ U without its own regul@@ arity . &quot;
it is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD associations .
and no one knows what comes next .
the mis@@ ery started with the unexpected clear defeat at the Saarland @-@ election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , more not , so@@ othing the comrades of the shot . &quot;
after the national elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ West@@ phal@@ ia there will be anything differently .
it was then also - and this everything was clearly worse .
&quot; the defeat in Kiel was brought into the exchange with the SPD , the Du@@ essel@@ dorf Haute the Party . &quot;
m@@ ant@@ y r@@ ag the comrades in the weeks after that .
&quot; then when they had just had new courage , the G @-@ 20 peaks came from Hamburg . &quot;
and with him the next leg .
&quot; Mayor Ola@@ f Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD of Land@@ esch@@ ef , lost in that weekend his N@@ im@@ bus because he sat in the Alsace , while his city burned . &quot;
&quot; and because he was doing so much in the crisis of crisis communication , that is what you can do wrong . &quot;
&quot; since then , Sch@@ olz has been fighting for its political survival . &quot;
so now Stephan Wei@@ l .
because of the VW Fri@@ g@@ inal gas and its role in the super@@ visory board stand the Lower Sax@@ on prime minister already since long in the criticism .
mi@@ ese re@@ fr@@ ing@@ values were added .
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps this is the reason why Wei@@ l tried to put more ever stronger in the covenant in the past weeks . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the former may@@ or of Hannover , his power in Berlin remained hidden in Berlin , he was not hidden in the surroundings of Martin Schulz . &quot;
they left him since they spoke of Wei@@ l a stabil@@ isation of the party .
&quot; now , the exact opposite could happen . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , Wei@@ l meets the party internal tw@@ ist of the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens in essence is not a fault . &quot;
and Schulz already were not at all .
&quot; sometimes , the comrades try to keep his own ranks closed . &quot;
&quot; your wrath is directed to the Gre@@ ens , and here mainly on the deport@@ ation of parliam@@ ent@@ arians in T@@ ev@@ . &quot;
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic defic@@ ien@@ cies such as woman dr@@ ags their own career eating over the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , Chief of the party &apos;s left in the SPD &apos;s Bundestag , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; Ms. T@@ emporary is not elected because of her person as a direct channel , but on the state list of the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens , so the Lower Sax@@ on member continues . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns their mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , Chief of the SPD &apos;s Bundestag , indic@@ ted a &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the paraly@@ sis four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l to the Prime Minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony @-@ election as a nickname in the Bundestag . &quot;
&quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U @-@ members become the True @-@ result , &quot; &quot; Op@@ per@@ mann said . &quot;
he called to clarify the backgrounds .
&quot; I want to know if there has been more , or there are additional commitments for the CD@@ U Lower Saxony . &quot;
sponsor of the Board of Directors
&quot; who wants to take home in the years , can soon get support from the country . &quot;
about this informal Mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives St@@ eg City development on Wednesday in delicate .
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ ind@@ ler gave once again a review on the previous day .
since 1991 it has been in delicate renovation areas .
&quot; then , in the refurb@@ ishment of I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg has taken over two thirds of the funding . &quot;
the subsi@@ dies in the San@@ ation area II from 2005 to 2016 the subsi@@ dies was at least 60 percent .
&quot; for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the previous San@@ al@@ loys are a &quot; &quot; success project &quot; &quot; - it is eventually important to promote internal development , and not only to tap new construction areas . &quot;
on April 4th we received the information from the government of the Government of Karlsruhe with the information that there will be a refurb@@ ishment region III .
&quot; the sum total amount 833 333 euros , of which there are 500 000 Euro from the country , the rest of the church received . &quot;
how is a refurb@@ ishment ?
&quot; one will continue to investigate the Sch@@ ind@@ ler , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are . &quot;
&quot; but it also play a role , whether in the planned area you were interested in taking place . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , the territory could then be postpon@@ ed again . &quot;
&quot; the pier on the Mit@@ tw@@ och@@ et Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel . &quot;
&quot; cellar presented the content of the covenant @-@ country program &quot; &quot; Social Town &quot; &quot; where the renov@@ ations would then be carried out . &quot;
the core of the programme are the re@@ vit@@ alization of internal cities that improve the living and working conditions and the preservation and expansion of the infrastructure .
&quot; the measures would be object @-@ related , which is called per plot . &quot;
the san@@ itation area would eventually be defined as a stat@@ ute .
the authorization period for the funding period runs since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026 .
&quot; even until September this year , however , once again the survey will be carried out , within the framework those who want to fill out a questionn@@ aire in the area involved . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , the pro@@ posi@@ tional process should be carried out in November or December , so that we can start with the renovation in the coming year . &quot;
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann explained that each Commun@@ e perform the occupied pre @-@ investigations .
&quot; it &apos;s going to assess the urban planning of the urban development , and decide when to be refurbished and to what extent . &quot;
it will then also be included in the plot for the respective property .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come once again and get a picture of the situation they spoke .
Got@@ zel stressed : an essential success factor for the project be the participation of the participants .
&quot; therefore , there will be questionn@@ aires that will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and will be filled up by the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow questionn@@ aire is the &quot; building and fundamental piece &quot; , &quot; with which it is among other things about the build condition and the renovation views . &quot;
&quot; in gray questionn@@ aire , the &quot; household and housing &quot; , &quot; may be made up to size , distribution and residents of a residential area . &quot;
&quot; the blue &quot; &quot; bow &quot; &quot; is only to fill if in the building business areas are operated . &quot;
&quot; however , I dism@@ is@@ sed to dism@@ is@@ sed that a fulfilling questionn@@ aire is not at the same time an application for funding . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , new measures are not eligible . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ ind@@ ler stressed that the distribution of funding &quot; &quot; wind @-@ principle &quot; &quot; - who arrives at first . &quot;
one could not make a promot@@ er@@ der for later . &quot;
&quot; at the conclusion , pictures of the project &quot; &quot; Local II &quot; &quot; was shown to make the present a renovation &quot; tasty . &quot; &quot;
bri@@ tish invent@@ ors advoc@@ ates a micro@@ chip to come with a hand @-@ movement in house and car
&quot; a bri@@ tish invent@@ or is the first in the country , which is equipped with a micro@@ chip , so that he can open its front door , enter your office and even start with a hand@@ rail movement . &quot;
&quot; Steven North@@ am , 33 , had impl@@ anted the tiny chip between thum@@ bs and fore@@ finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology by his company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he has performed with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , a consultant An@@ a@@ es@@ thesi@@ sts at the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , together to ensure that the impl@@ ant procedures are carried out after medical standards . &quot;
the technology resem@@ bles a cats and dogs impl@@ anted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
&quot; North@@ am also wants to change the locks on houses and cars , so that they are compatible with the chip , all for a surcharge of £ 300 per lock . &quot;
the married father of one has now built both at home and his BMW Z@@ 4 technology which begins when his hand at the wheel is .
the cost @-@ cost of the White House cost the tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
&quot; the decision of the White House , a nav@@ al hel@@ icopter to the South Law@@ n for an event that cuts the American production last month , costs tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the statements of the military which were left to TI@@ ME magazine until 24.@@ 000 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white Sik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs . &quot;
President Donald Tru@@ mp , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and officials of the White House made a tour of products from all over 50 states .
&quot; the hel@@ icopter was posted in Connecticut , next to a yacht of Maine , a fire@@ man from Wis@@ cons@@ in and a for@@ kli@@ ft from Mississippi . &quot;
&quot; the Military Office of the White House required the presence of the hel@@ icopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ GO , barely 36 hours before the hel@@ icopter in the South Law@@ n landed , according to the records of Marine Hel@@ ia S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit who is responsible for the operation of the hel@@ icopter . &quot;
&quot; I only wanted to be aware that you are aware of this because it is such an un@@ common event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the comm@@ ander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event of its superi@@ ors , the vice @-@ nav@@ al ar@@ quit@@ oes for aviation . &quot;
&quot; the message showed that the Hel@@ icopter arrived at the South Law@@ n at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning at the South Law@@ n for the event at 15 o &apos;clock , and so long stayed until the lawn between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 p.m. on that evening . &quot;
&quot; note that if the departure would be del@@ ayed from the White House , due to the limitation of the service we would need a second team for the flight back . &quot;
&quot; the original flight crew was found during the event at the hel@@ icopter , while the safety personnel of the unit remained on the floor during the period . &quot;
&quot; from the recordings made available , it was not clear whether ultimately a second flight crew was required . &quot;
the H@@ atch Act prohi@@ bits federal states of state property for political purposes .
records indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could viol@@ ate the purpose .
&quot; a question we asked , was whether it was a violation of H@@ atch A@@ cts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the comm@@ ander . &quot;
&quot; sounds , as if you are locked , &quot; the dep@@ uty comm@@ ander . &quot;
&quot; the event &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by H@@ atch Act . &quot;
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; on the event , the president gave an impetus to reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated the efforts for the in@@ corporation of government regulations . &quot;
&quot; the use of the aircraft , which is known as Marine One or Air Force One , for politically advant@@ ageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon . &quot;
President are obliged to use them for the journey .
but their use only for a Photo @-@ OP is unusual .
&quot; Tru@@ mp was conducted in February as the presidential plane before the background of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , Tax@@ i@@ Services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that agree on the use of the presidential aircraft by its predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; - the products from all over 50 states are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the Vice @-@ President of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 @-@ cre@@ ws often perform training flights in the area around Washington and in the South Law@@ n through to reset the U.S. President in the White House with conc@@ ise centimeters .
&quot; as a Tru@@ mp in early July at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 led in the White House 58 exercises . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event occurred at the training requirement of the flight crew for the month , said an official . &quot;
hel@@ icopter units flew in addition 11 hours to this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support . &quot;
&quot; the White House said that the tax@@ pay@@ ers presented the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps that were presented at the event . &quot;
&quot; a sp@@ okes@@ man of Sik@@ or@@ sky said , the company was not involved in joining the hel@@ icopter on the South Law@@ n . &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not keep Bud@@ get@@ ing design@@ ations for the presidential and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
&quot; according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ ari@@ sts of the U.S. Ministry for the fiscal year 2017 , the DO@@ H @-@ refund for the V@@ H @-@ 3D , however , 24.@@ 380 USD per flight time . &quot;
records of unity to record the flight time of aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of Marine Cor@@ ps Air Facility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House argu@@ ed that the actual cost of running the hel@@ icopter is far below that rate .
&quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers on the basis of estimates for the refund sets is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs which are included in the annual funding . &quot;
&quot; according to a Rand @-@ Study from 2015 included the pay@@ outs for DO@@ D not the personnel cost , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract conclusion . &quot;
&quot; at this time the former sp@@ okes@@ person of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , the use of hel@@ icopter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present this week things that are produced in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot;
&quot; and I know that Sik@@ or@@ sky and the State of Connecticut , are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I go out of that hundreds , if not even thousands of people are dependent on it . &quot;
&quot; and I think like most Americans are all proud of the hel@@ icopter and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ reless . &quot;
it is of course adequate to highlight this .
&quot; it was not clear whether Tru@@ mp with the hel@@ icopter inter@@ conducted , when he bet@@ ray his tour about the South Law@@ n for the event , but he sat down in the chassis of a fire@@ man . &quot;
&quot; in the White House , Tru@@ mp talked to representatives of Sik@@ or@@ sky and spoke with the media about his own fleet of company products . &quot;
&quot; I know Sik@@ or@@ sky very good , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss at the tri@@ cky task
leading of the Second Tennis @-@ Bundes@@ liga joins the tab@@ ular Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer SV .
the TC Blue @-@ White Ne@@ uss starts tomorrow from 11 am in Kiel on the tabby with Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer SV .
&quot; despite after five games , more and more active record has the leading edge of the second tennis Bundes@@ liga received the sense of reality . &quot;
Team@@ director Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has any respect for the opponent .
that is a compact team which plays always in quite similar formation .
just on the back positions I find the crew very good . &quot;
&quot; for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer SV , especially the imports from the high north . &quot;
&quot; their plans and fin@@ s can even refer to inserts in the Davis Cup .
&quot; and they are also strong in the double , &quot; says Z@@ ay with views of Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andre Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben Ol@@ esen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas Bj@@ ör@@ hus ( all Denmark ) . &quot;
&quot; this is as always hard for us .
there you also need a good portion of luck . &quot;
the Ne@@ uss@@ er team for the trip to the high north is handy .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ four .
&quot; even at the Chall@@ enger tournament in Italian Bi@@ ella , the Italian Bi@@ ella Active Fr@@ ench@@ man does not come to the Bundes@@ liga @-@ game , the tournament in Czech Republic Liberec Region will come to his first use in this season . &quot;
the so far Chil@@ ean Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo was yesterday with the White rus@@ hing An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski yet at the AT@@ P tournament in Kitz@@ b@@ üh@@ el on the ball .
&quot; he should be in Kiel as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ cul@@ p , N@@ iel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgi@@ ans Ju@@ lien C@@ agn@@ ina . &quot;
after his two wins on the last Sunday against the club on the Al@@ ster could also push Má@@ t@@ é Val@@ kus@@ z again into the team .
&quot; it is enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was in January 2016 the number one of the Jun@@ iors world list , does not fill someone out of the coach of Mari@@ us Z@@ ay the cad@@ res . &quot;
how America can harm the O@@ MV
&quot; truly happy , Donald Tru@@ mp did not work out his signature under the law for the shar@@ pen@@ ing of sanctions against Russia . &quot;
&quot; in his H@@ ast , the Law came to er@@ un@@ ched , the Congress gave a few &quot; constitutional rules &quot; , &quot; he estimated . &quot;
&quot; the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels fo@@ aming against the US army . &quot;
&quot; after all , the draft states to pun@@ ish European companies that will help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines in the EU . &quot;
&quot; since then , investors from domestic O@@ MV are combined with other European companies to build the construction of the Russian Ost@@ se@@ el@@ ich Nord Stream 2 . &quot;
the dru@@ g@@ ul@@ isse is violent .
&quot; nevertheless , it is too early for an estim@@ ation of the consequences , so the official statement of the oil group . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Donald Tru@@ mp would have to aw@@ aken sanctions nor by Executive Order to life . &quot;
twelve weapons stand there for choosing .
&quot; the press &quot; has been viewed , which the Group could susp@@ ect and which could truly hurt him . &quot;

Rolle backward : the city provides 46 chefs
the town organiz@@ es the K@@ ita @-@ lunch again .
with fixed contact persons for the children and a assignment to the team .
in the urban day@@ care centres the clock is revers@@ ed .
&quot; on September 1 , the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the me@@ al@@ care in the urban day@@ care centres ( Kit@@ as ) again in DIY . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ ance , Deputy leader in the field of youth aid , this is good news : &quot; we all very pleased . &quot;
&quot; cooked continues except the house : a Cat@@ erer takes over this task , and delivers fresh cool@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the city operates in the Kre@@ feld area 46 kinder@@ gart@@ ens , in 44 the children get a warm meal . &quot;
&quot; in the last kit@@ a@@ year , there are 2800 children at the tables , and the need for growing steadily . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile not only children , the 45 weekends of hours are taken care of , in the K@@ ita to noon , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot;
the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour supervision when children stay up to 14 o &apos;clock .
&quot; 46 sub @-@ time forces have since 1 September kitchen service : they warm the Anglo @-@ delivered foods , supplement them to salad , rough and fruit , por@@ tion@@ ing the meal individually , give food fl@@ ush and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are strongly assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot;
the size - there are two @-@ sized entities as well as the seventh units - decides on the timetable .
&quot; the kitchen inside belong to the K@@ ita team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; so they are much stronger involved and it is easier to realise the sound , pe@@ dagog@@ ical concepts . &quot;
because that is why it is about healthy nutrition and cooking .
the children should help you prepare the food .
the direct connection of the chef &apos;s staff is there useful .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a known power in the K@@ ita , one person who is familiar to them , and not ever @-@ changing people . &quot;
this continuity was important for the children .
the cleansing of the K@@ ita @-@ Rooms - until now also the task of the chef - will be done in future by special clean@@ ers .
&quot; this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has next to quality improvement of the kitchen , even the charm that they have turned into the cost between self @-@ reg@@ ation and stran@@ gers to the city as the most economical method , called it from the press office . &quot;
&quot; and that , although 46 sub @-@ time forces will be newly set . &quot;
&quot; but these hours of approximately 750 people in the gu@@ ardi@@ ans are not so strong in the weight , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot;

G@@ MB concern about investment in Mc@@ Vi@@ tie @-@ Factory in Glasgow
a trade union would like to wi@@ den with managers of the Bis@@ ku@@ it @-@ manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie on the long @-@ term commitment to production in their work in Glasgow .
G@@ MB Scotland said to wei@@ gh the company on the future of investments at the t@@ oll@@ cross site .
&quot; more than 500 employees work at work , which is besides other products of hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea bis@@ cuits . &quot;
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pl@@ adi@@ s said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; he added that employees and trade union officials were &quot; &quot; first experienced &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the branch of the company called G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s to express concerns , that funding for the modernisation of production lines will not be pushed forward . &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB Senior organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; &quot; the fact that we can gain no clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of rab@@ bit , concerns our members . &quot;
&quot; generations of families have worked here and the workforce concentrate on local community and the Greater Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and against the background of Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising life of life and of the chronic production process , the most eastern end of Glasgow strongly urgently a thri@@ ving production capacity at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; a speaker from Pl@@ adi@@ s said , &quot; &quot; the Fili@@ p@@ onder@@ ance at T@@ oll@@ cross has only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will respond directly to it , since we appreciate the continued commitment of employees and trade union officials . &quot;
&quot; two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the employees , that we are like all the companies operating in an extremely competitive and un@@ certain economic climate , our stores are constantly checked and this applies to all our business areas and locations - at competitive . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , you added : &quot; &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognize the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site and at all , we should change our operational processes at the site , the employees and their trade union officials will be the first to experience this . &quot;
has the PS@@ G Barcelona have war@@ ned three years ago in front of N@@ ey@@ mar ?
the site of La Liga likes their interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti ber@@ eu@@ l
&quot; Paris Saint @-@ Germain is not consult@@ ed in their persecution of N@@ ey@@ mar , after having made an offer of £ 189 million , in order to vali@@ date his free@@ wheel cl@@ oning , but they have war@@ ned Barcelona three years before the world decay ? &quot;
&quot; the sens@@ ational approach has raised the transfer@@ ed window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break down the World Council to break more than the one of the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba in the past season for 89 million pounds to Manchester United . &quot;
&quot; after completion , N@@ ey@@ mar is for the most expensive players in the world and for the maximum paid professional spor@@ tsmen of the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500@@ .000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is fur@@ ious over the way , as N@@ ey@@ mar has forced their way out there , although a spring has always given its best to care for his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 to take care of him . &quot;
but was the football world given three years ago from the PS@@ G President prior to this prospect ?
&quot; as Manchester City 2014 interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ ui@@ di , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for each association which wanted to sign one of the best players by PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , then we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but if they try to sign one of our players in sign , this will have consequences . &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line with the Spanish club at the beginning of this summer interest in the PS@@ G @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti .
&quot; PS@@ G made clear that they would not allow it to travel to the International from Italy under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by doing one of their prizes for N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot;

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Review ent@@ lo@@ et Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report to the abuse @-@ cases pop@@ ulated Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and histori@@ an Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report to abuse at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen continues for discussions .
&quot; Christian Weis@@ n@@ der , speaker of the reform movement &quot; We are Church &quot; , &quot; declared by former Reg@@ ens@@ burger Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the dom@@ inal Master R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year brother of the em@@ eri@@ ed Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI . &quot;
&quot; it would be a reputation for the Catholic Church , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own under@@ standings or their then false estimate of the processes . &quot;
&quot; the Vatican Council &quot; Os@@ serv@@ atore Rom@@ ano , &quot; however , cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed that during the reporting of violence in the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen with &quot; two measurements &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with regard to the gri@@ ps in Regensburg , nobody knows that it would be pun@@ ished for &quot; sh@@ ame@@ ful and sh@@ ame@@ ful actions &quot; , &quot; which would be pun@@ ished and prevented in the future ; but the &quot; degree of medi@@ al Mani@@ pulation , &quot; says the author of Luc@@ ie Scar@@ aff@@ ia , histori@@ an and a member of the national Italian bio@@ ethics committee . &quot;
&quot; the habit that describe the Catholic Church as a source of all evil , is already part of the everyday experience and prepar@@ es public opinion to keep it normal for normal &quot; , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot;
also Für@@ stin Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is said in the interview with Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk : &quot; we are happy to go to the church and that &apos;s a ti@@ ly connected .
&quot; moreover , it pointed out that in her youth &quot; saw a very normal educational means &quot; , &quot; to be with friends , as I was one , ready to be done . &quot;
they &apos;re unfair to use today &apos;s standards in earlier decades as the world have changed .
&quot; in connection with reports on the abuse cases , often Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often emerged . &quot;
&quot; totally to un@@ right , author and histori@@ an Michael Hes@@ emann , who has been translated with R@@ atz@@ inger &quot; &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; &quot; ( in 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; for all that had nothing to do with him , &quot; he used the outcome of the final report . &quot;
what exactly stands in the 440 @-@ page report that was presented by the di@@ oc@@ ese Regensburg with the En@@ ch@@ ment attorney Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; a total of 2,@@ 547 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; with high pl@@ au@@ sibility &quot; victims of gri@@ ps , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen sexually ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; the final report is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg : &quot; &quot; in conclusion , that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases forms of physical and psych@@ ic violence . &quot;
especially at high E@@ mot@@ ion@@ ality the treatment could also become veh@@ ement for the students .
&quot; nevertheless , contrary to numerous other acc@@ us@@ ations , that many victims still cher@@ ished the common humanity of R. , and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence even having positive memories with it . &quot;
&quot; in the interview , Hes@@ emann , why the Final Report on the abuse of the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was in his opinion . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ Pages report about the &quot; Pre@@ fail@@ ures of violence &quot; at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; gives a contradi@@ c@@ tory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
&quot; to one lift many students of his &quot; humanity . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other , he also appears as ch@@ oler@@ ance and perf@@ ection@@ ist who was pal@@ p@@ ly designed in the Ö@@ f@@ teren when a Dom@@ sp@@ atz was not a top performance . &quot;
how do you evaluate as its bio@@ grapher this final report ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : when you read the trouble and reads all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back , one has to wonder why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was at all in it . &quot;
it is dedicated to him eight pages and he is clearly released by any sus@@ pic@@ ion of the medi@@ ate or pe@@ dest@@ al in the terrible cases sexual abuse .
&quot; also , the non @-@ violence show at the pre @-@ school un@@ iting out of its efficiency . &quot;
one can imagine it at best to get out of it too late or take the first hint not seriously enough .
&quot; the cath@@ edr@@ yer of the school , in which he worked , was felt by nearly all Be@@ aches as - so literally - &quot; salvation &quot; , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; thus , the vast majority of his students , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger presents him a very excellent record , &quot; &quot; loved &quot; , &quot; &quot; sincerely , &quot; , &quot; compet@@ ently , &quot; &quot; compet@@ ently &quot; , &quot; and &quot; compreh@@ en@@ sible &quot; , &quot; which the guys regularly revol@@ ted with cakes , bis@@ cuits and Bon@@ b@@ ons supplies and &quot; always by grapes from children . &quot;
only a minority compl@@ aining about his perf@@ ection@@ ism and his high ex@@ or@@ ality that led to wound @-@ brood also already .
&quot; that he was not only bow@@ ed with chairs and bow@@ ls and bow@@ ls the bow@@ ls , but also ear@@ thy guys in the hair or ears , he has left them even more years ago , deeply regret and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it . &quot;
&quot; to his honorary salvation , however , must be said that such educ@@ ation@@ methods in the fragile time , the 1960s and 19@@ 70s have been widely used , with parents like by instruc@@ tors . &quot;
do you also know such breeding @-@ methods ?
&quot; of course , I think everyone of us was born before 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I have seen this still in a world@@ ly school , a state of Gymnasium . &quot;
&quot; compared to what it is actually going on in this report , namely the primary sexual abuse and non @-@ violence at the pre @-@ school , are the non @-@ violent dre@@ d@@ elling . &quot;
&quot; if you ask yourself if it is not more likely to do with his famili@@ arity and his role as the brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media has just cr@@ ashed on him . &quot;
&quot; on the Bav@@ arian pop@@ e , so many who have never understood it , nor ever @-@ free@@ zing . &quot;
the truth is : the Rel@@ aun@@ ching Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
&quot; in connection with the report , a lot about the issue of abuse at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the Final Report as well as any rever@@ sibility or co @-@ operation with regard to sexual abuse to the load ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : very clearly no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual gri@@ ps claims to have become familiar with the dom@@ inal master .
not even parents were consec@@ rated .
&quot; I have never dr@@ unk to talk to my father or my mother , &quot; &quot; said a Bet@@ ener repres@@ sions for the others , &quot; It was all very embarrassing . &quot;
&quot; the true issue in clarification of sexual abuse was , and is however , that most victims are not silent . &quot;
&quot; if they do not even become parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a choral leader , who would certainly have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators . &quot;
how do you rate the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen students R@@ atz@@ ing@@ ers role in terms of mis@@ use cases ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a ques@@ tion@@ ist student form@@ ulate it so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I do not see any case in which he could have had timely insights and had to stop the respective perpet@@ rators .
&quot; I think it ... also for really absurd to accept that it rested on him ... Bub@@ en im@@ pregn@@ able or clear@@ er or more rather , as compared to their parents , boarding , trust , etc . &quot;
that one speaks with him about sex ... - un@@ th@@ ink@@ able .
&quot; thus the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; that in advance concerned students and / or their environment , could not be confirmed within the framework of the examination . &quot;
&quot; what sexual abuse affects , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is therefore free of everyone . &quot;
&quot; thus he cannot be thrown into it , nor may it be prevented or adver@@ t . &quot;
&quot; therefore there is no reason to bring his good name with these resi@@ dual crimes , as unfortunately it happened in some cases . &quot;
the media was much of &quot; non@@ violence &quot; at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger will look forward to the report &quot; path . &quot;
does he have to live with this acc@@ us@@ ation ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that in the reporting everything revol@@ ves and decei@@ ves to a huge mel@@ ange taken out of sexual abuse and non@@ violence and somewhere , in the midst of , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; yet , that is precisely the abuse of the report . &quot;
&quot; namely , it will be clean separated : between the pre @-@ school and the gram@@ mar school , between sexual abuse and non @-@ violence , as well as we say to other pre@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report also deals dating from the period since 1945 , i.e. for four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not a choral leader . &quot;
&quot; the whole terrible audit@@ ing Pe@@ dagog@@ y , the cases , in which Kn@@ aben were controlled by s@@ adi@@ stic teachers and mal@@ ign@@ ed and under@@ sl@@ ated themselves at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen , where really sk@@ andal@@ ous stat@@ ors have to have heard . &quot;
&quot; but with whom had Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because he got the boy only to face , when they had already been on the dom@@ ini@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; on this was , how the all@@ eged witnesses acc@@ entu@@ ate witnesses , the topic &quot; &quot; Pre @-@ School &quot; &quot; tab@@ u . &quot;
one was just happy to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &apos; heavenly &quot; states .
what was different in the dom@@ ini@@ ties ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : there was already discipline , but there is no s@@ adi@@ c violence . &quot;
&quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; many victims would cher@@ ished the common humanity of R. , and therefore in many cases , despite violence even having positive memories with it . &quot;
&quot; so , at most still the re@@ acc@@ us@@ ation remains , away . &quot;
&quot; despite all efforts , the report was able to define only two periods in which it was reported from the states at the pre @-@ school . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish itself and was responsible for the events at a school , which he was just not working and responsible ( so the witness ) didn &apos;t want to hear , and then again in 1993 . &quot;
Ver@@ lock Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in front of the states consistently the ears ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the dom@@ es@@ cre@@ tory of the cathedral , who even re@@ produces the report . &quot;
&quot; in this , he pointed out this to that in the pre @-@ school continued to be practic@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; even in view of the danger of negative pres@@ ences , he recommended urgent intim@@ i@@ dation . &quot;
&quot; of course , this was at a time , as a legal clarity consisted , as the testing was also being banned in Bavaria too . &quot;
&quot; before doing it , they were in a legal gray area , as everyone of us probably know . &quot;
&quot; there was also difficult to estimate for him , where the suffer@@ ers may be exagger@@ ated or dram@@ ati@@ zed , and where really the per@@ missible limit was exceeded . &quot;
&quot; but one cannot say , he would have always taken away . &quot;
this is just not true .
&quot; only in 1980 , the test was officially completed in Bavaria too . &quot;
&quot; Für@@ stin Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is h@@ ari@@ ed yes , it is unfair to apply today &apos;s pe@@ dagog@@ ical standards for the dam@@ al@@ time period . &quot;
how do you see that ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we histori@@ an talking about &quot; &quot; pit@@ falls of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; , &quot; i.e. the danger , last to present days of today &apos;s moral scale . &quot;
since has the prin@@ cess already right .
&quot; this is of course not true for sexual abuse , who was at all times ab@@ om@@ able and also not for what is broken down in the pre @-@ school for resistance and violence against in@@ noc@@ ents , which goes far beyond that time . &quot;
&quot; this is all very terrible , and I am glad that it will finally be re@@ worked . &quot;
&quot; but at the same time , I must take the Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , for all that had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; his means for discipl@@ in@@ ence and cut@@ ters , i.e. ear@@ rings and to pull together in the ha@@ irs , and ears were widely spread in the 19@@ 70s . &quot;
&quot; when bodily existence was then banned , he has also kept strictly with it . &quot;
&quot; what image of his Reg@@ ens@@ burger time has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because in the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
was the topic test also for language ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI . , told his perspective , and the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen played only a secondary role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I am not at all that he led a strictly Reg@@ iment there . &quot;
&quot; but even that must be said once again : without these perf@@ ection@@ ism , without the un@@ demanding discipline , it would hardly have been possible , from the until then rather nation@@ alistic Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen an institution of Wel@@ d@@ g forms , true cultural botanical garden of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with Kek@@ sen and Bon@@ b@@ ons alone , one does not make a big singer and stand out of any success in which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming . &quot;
as what kind of man did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger for talks about their book ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond that I experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger again and again lived as a wonderful , hum@@ orous , basic , deep , deep and hearty people , from which one could not imagine that he could do just a fly something to him . &quot;
&quot; I come regularly with how many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen still come to him today , 23 years after its Emer@@ itus , regularly contact him to read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those who do not forgive him up to date , that he was once strictly speaking to them , are therefore clearly in the minority . &quot;
most of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are thankful to him today that he enriched their lives and took care of the world of music .
&quot; and that he always had a good , voc@@ alist teacher - a str@@ ingent father , certainly , that may be - but also a lov@@ able respect , to which she still had to look at this day and to honor it . &quot;
&quot; and please , once again very clearly : everything you are thro@@ ws are educ@@ ative , which were then on the order of the day . &quot;
we can be glad that we have long overcome this time .
&quot; but it is highly un@@ just , a man , just because he is promin@@ ently and has a very prominent brother to make the medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ ats . &quot;
&quot; there is the n@@ asty intent that stands behind it , just too obvious . &quot;
&quot; the report , which has just been released , over@@ loaded him . &quot;
&quot; now the dec@@ ency today would have acquired a 93 year old man who has acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria , and perhaps Germany , no one would like to know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
