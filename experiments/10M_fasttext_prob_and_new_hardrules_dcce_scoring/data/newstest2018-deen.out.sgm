<seg id="53">"a recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes it more difficult to gain discrimination, as well as the prosecution authorities of the State, the disproportionate to minorities, the NAACP said, said the NAACP."</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have violations of civil rights, people happen."</seg>
<seg id="55">"they are halted because of their skin colour, they will be beaten or killed," said the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star. "</seg>

<seg id="58">"the group misled incidents like racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>

<seg id="67">Ordination of Weidezaunproject is spontaneous</seg>
<seg id="68">The hereditary pasture project is a success project and is continued in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU-Bundestag Peter White and Kordula Kovac have shown himself a picture on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="70">"at the rectangible of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fisheracher CDU-local association met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members."</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann granted initially insights into its operations, in which he enjoys 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and also served in five apartments holiday guests."</seg>
<seg id="72">"the" "Schwarzwaldmilch" "is for him the alternate marketer away for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the holiday guests only comes regionales.</seg>
<seg id="74">"since he is also a BLHV-president of Fishing bach, he called the Weidezaunproject as" spontaneous "." "</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot be able to profit in such a steep areas.</seg>
<seg id="76">"the green space for a lot of work, many mts with the motor sense are processed."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have here to fight with the conditions and with the topography," emphasised swidemann. "</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003 he assumed the elterous operation and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if he is not a biooperation."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" "the Commune recognised the meaning of the pasture project and is glad to support the leader."</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">"" "we hope that the forestation of the areas could be moved out for quite a while."</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure that we have, are the people who work in agriculture and worry about how they continue their operation," says the mayor. "</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often standing in criticism because of their support</seg>
<seg id="84">Over the Weidezaunlimited promotion were fenced in 2013 a total of 25 plots of eleven participants.</seg>
<seg id="85">"the disclosure surface amounts to 40 hectares, which can not be enforged until at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"of the total cost of 71 500 Euro the half was funded by the Leader, a quarter carried out the community fishing bach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus, the farmers have to invest 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of pasture fence."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the big advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac stressed:" "you do a really good job, without farmers and land."</seg>
<seg id="90">Even for Peter Weiss stood firm: "here are the best food produced."</seg>
<seg id="91">The Agricultural Policy (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the state promotion of women-tough.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is the disclosure of the Schwarzwalds.</seg>
<seg id="93">The presence of one of the LPR marked conveyors is the presence of one of the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">"in addition, the intermittent surface may not be applied (Hangslope above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened with forestation."</seg>
<seg id="95">"for the hereditary Weidezamisproject 2018, the application of eight participants currently runs with 24 plots, which would like to build up close to 16 kilometers fence."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the disclosure surface corresponds to 35 hectares, the cold costs are more than 112 000 Euro."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is taking the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is it when they begin to attacking the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the corrupt overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key-ideologues of the Trump regime, knew what he did when he took a symbolic Axt in a hitful battle with Jim Acosta of CNN on the proposals of the President to the drastical restriction of legal migration with the statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">"to stay fair, Miller did not handle the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of jetties and Liberty Shiitators would have earned him when he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he laid their significance, and in particular the meaning that you were written, when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, his base was added."</seg>
<seg id="105">"as Miller Acosta, I want to go here not to a complete thing about history, but the statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world."</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem to which you can refer to which later was added and not part of the original statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is knowledgeable right, but as he did it ourselves, it is not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary response to the ascending words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants, but the poorest people of the poor:" "your humble, your poor, / thy hearted masses, who like to breathe free, / the elend waste of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">There has never been a time in which the "elaping waste" was better to see on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller had not engaged in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict due to the meaning of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural conflict: it is indeed a conflict in the meaning of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who sat down to place their words after her death at the base - did very well that they have accomplished a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and american republicanism by presenting the female embodiment of the freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem is the feminine character not more abstract - it has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she himself gives himself a very different name: mother of the Exilants.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and just like Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people wanted to change it for a long time from the right wing."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the big scream Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argumed 2010, that the Statue of Liberty doesn't interfere, but rather an early Neoconservo who bring American Flame into the world:" Lady Liberty continues. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not enlighten the way into the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh here on something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is completely and even a question of the standpoint of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative act of Lazarus consisted of how they had seen from the exhaustible, but hopeful people after long and often terrible travel to the decks of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"it is in the truest sense about seeing the world from the perspective of people, seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome to hear them.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that is of course not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever would like to recognise.</seg>
<seg id="127">"your torch should not enlighten the way, but the hate that is their only source of power."</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championships 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="129">Eiliie Doyle is reminiscent of a time when only two villi have belonged to the team of Great Britain</seg>

<seg id="134">I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and think that it has done something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="136">British athletics: it has something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type at the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes, medals are medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - to compete against Sir Mo Farah, while Eiliie Doyle was elected by the team for the team captain."</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eiliie is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">"their surrender-speech was incredible," says Black. "</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">"the passion and the real feeling, the Eiliie all of course brought, were great."</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth Silver medal, who will join her 5th World Championships for the 400-m hurdles, says that it is" incredible "that 16 Schrots are in the British team."</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship has been seven, the 1983 and 2015 were achieved. "</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle-time Muir leads on this way and has set up five British and two European records in the past year.</seg>
<seg id="147">"she will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 metres."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, the 1,500 m runs, is another shearpiece, which one should observe the victory in the British team Trials and the Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle is reminded of their first World Championships as the only other chirons in the team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the team captain's captain says that they are" great pride "to the fact that many of their compatriots do not only belong to the team but in some cases also with the medals and the Finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"the particular team captain will be in it, is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honor, but knowing that my team members have voted for me and chose to have something very special for me," added them. "</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I am very proud of all the villi that belong to the team."</seg>
<seg id="153">It shows only how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to rise on podium."</seg>
<seg id="155">What is my speech as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think she went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">"so it is really important to put this home support and benefit from it, that we are again at the Olympiastadion."</seg>
<seg id="159">I'm getting a second chance to go there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there.</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking of critics via Facebook: do not take you a public office if you are unable to wear the bursting of voters.</seg>
<seg id="161">The Father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it did not last long until the newspapers bend it because of the internal policy to its political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">He imparted in criticism safe.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he has not brought his critics to silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"in 1783 Washington said," "the freedom of expression can be taken away - and, stupid and mute we shall be led to the sheep."</seg>
<seg id="166">"this brings me to Governor Larry Hogan who must work on it, to be more like Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans staff have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union defendant him from the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the Stab of the Governors left the lawsuit as frivol, and the online comment was full of a backlash with" Na, and?. "</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is only Facebook," said many people. "</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when it is a type like hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republicans governor in a overwhelming democratic state that is astounding.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the two-est consent of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary Hitzead.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a fixed hand in the management of its state and strict adherence to principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillfully to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and playful his haired head after chemotherapy on his site.</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, the blockage of individuals who come to the side of the Governors - that is a public Forum that is officially referred to as officially and by employees who are paid by public tax-Dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans Amelia Chasse Chasse Chasse Chasse the acts of the Governing Board and argued that the blockages of the comments is nothing more than a moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">"but it is too simple to use the image of troughs or spammers or splash-filled people, which vibrate online the pumping swing."</seg>
<seg id="181">"the post spoke with some of the real people, which were blocked by Hogan."</seg>
<seg id="182">"and these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, no trollables."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said that their comments are respectful, thoughtful and not profane."</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor was the Bible in his post and appeal to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani by Bowie, Md., was not hasserted, but she asked to hate."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented rude that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate-vomiting and other current news," wrote them in the commentary box of the message "" The Post. "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I also appreciate this idea if a number of people on the same issue is taking place, then they are misused by some more than a so-called collective action and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the staff of the Governors as" "concentrated Spam attack" "would have other probably" "intercession". ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"the Facebook era makes it easy to tribute a message by simply a manist, or a negative comment will be deleted."</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is much cleaner than in past times when you had done the same thing, that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical guidance and to burn or put demonstrators."</seg>
<seg id="191">But that is exactly what is happening digital.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public officials who criticized that he has sparked Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is indicted by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>

<seg id="196">And Kentucky got Governor Matt Bean (R) also a visit to the ACLU because of its use on Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be as heavy.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at the time of Washington, the time of affordable potos had a similar effect as the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers multiplies between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous briefing slip on his leadership."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even at that time Washington had an anonymous trolls.</seg>

<seg id="1323">I love me in love and made an offer on that day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first visit, the 1.000 square kilometer has been completely rebuilt."</seg>
<seg id="1325">"originally a bedroom property with a spooked layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne's storage space and a mezzanine floor to optimally use the generous ceiling height."</seg>

<seg id="1811">"but on that day, in the shadow of her own tragedy, they came together to talk about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told to them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-level journalists discuss what is safer to feel: you should take their children with the office, who were at home the target of an attack with granulates, or at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"security experts have written three words on a blackboard on the front of the room: opponents, Neutral, allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"they ask the reporters, name for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and abdominal."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drugs, politicians, businessmen, businessmen, journalists, the suspected list of government or box, a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no retirement ause by violence, and throughout the country the corpses are more and more journalists all over, since President Enrique Pena Nieto have entered into December 2012. 589 are after attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there were at least seven deaths in seven states."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter there is their publisher and its inspirer of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest bug it is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist, Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1820">"his absence will be deeply felt deep, although its presence is present everywhere - a great photo of Valdez, which shows his mid-finger with the word" Justice "building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, carry T-shirts who will be able to show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporter discuss about their shared topics, the trauma, their nightmare, sleeplessness, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although 2010, a Sonder-Bundeswehr was established in order to process the cases of journalists, this according to the Committee for the Protection of journalists was introduced only two criminal proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most thousands of Morden, which are connected every year with drug trading and organised crime, the murderers of journalists will rarely be put in court."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"in Riodosia they still exist to treat the violence of Sinaloa, although they are untralled and even though the terrain is still oblique."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderers, without justice, the meetings for the discussion of security, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to wasting my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we do not know the Why, distrust it all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"on the morning of May 15, Valdez forsook the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the provincial capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he managed to drive a few blocks away before his roter Toyota Corolla was raised by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - that is translated with" "twelve" "flow."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The cap was removed in his car and damaged it near.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He leaves a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">"rumly tends to fly freely in Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the topic of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzmans sticking last year and delivery in the United States in January, Sinaloa became one of the bloodiest slain areas of the country, since rivalisating political groups are struggling to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it makes nothing that in Sinaloa every day someone or more people are shot at the road or that the cemetery is full of twisted, two-story masheen for drug-rounder, which are bigger than many houses for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">"for a minute, there is a state of" tranquility "if only a box control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs routes in the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1838">"despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the guilt that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first, in February the release of a interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival card-actions in the war with Guzmans Sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may have consecuated the sons, suspected Ganglers-members buy each copy of the output, as soon as it was supplied to time-kioske."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second mistake was not to force Valdez, following the confiscation of another newspaper which had released the same story to leave the country to its own safety."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and its killing will be regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had so long survived that his friends and colleagues helped him that he would be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">"he worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste, when he joined together with five colleagues in establishing Riodoce, and sold 50 US dollars."</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa," it was impossible to operate journalism without hesitry problem, "said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1847">"with time, the newspaper expelled a reputation because of the courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporter loved it, hard treffening studies without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else could catch."</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the establishment of Riodoce she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors" Prize "for their coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of journalists for his courage in the persecution of the Mexican drug history, wherever they conducted."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave himself up voluntarily to that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I would like to continue" "he said at the time of the CPJ award."</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug trading in Sinaloa" is a lifestyle, "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV."</seg>
<seg id="1854">You need to take over the task that falls as a journalist - either the or you play the dumb.</seg>

<seg id="1856">"the Riodoce-team miss Valdez, the Spaßbird, who was like a port-bird, who was like a port workers, who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survived."</seg>
<seg id="1857">You trust in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would go to El Guaynabo, the bar across from office, go and sit there at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">"well, they ask: was his love for the routine be his verbs?"</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also compelled to ask her own assumptions about how they do their work best and remain alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret startup and cross-railways' to move drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high level of sucensorship and self-disclosure."</seg>
<seg id="1865">His own instinins trust.</seg>

<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a mid-class district of Culiacan.</seg>

<seg id="1874">"it is months since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape, where the drugs of drugs are de facto under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the output of this week Riodoce has led to three main layers.</seg>

<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé among the government spending that focused on the hometown of the Governors.</seg>

<seg id="1882">"Villarreal bat the Reporter, about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one, in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman departed a military overfall."</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months before had the reader considered the Kolumne of Valdez as the best informed source of the kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"before we had already known what is happening," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "" El FLACO "because of its slim body."</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication are broken with our sources."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"the office of Valdez was devoted to the storage room for characters and stickers, dedicated against the Morde of journalists, because the employees have become something they had never expected: activists in the name of the press."</seg>

<seg id="1931">"he met something that seemed to be seen from the surrounding rock at the burst, and decided to see more accurately."</seg>

<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) heavy groovens."</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work the finished result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you just blinzeln, you could almost believe that it has slept," said the main autor Caleb Brown, scientists at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is seen. "</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will enter into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaurs, the mona Lisa of the Dinosauction."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers have found that these plant eaters, although he is covered with an armor and a changing shell, probably being threatened by meat-dinosaur dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the strongly armored dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide from smoking, and used a shielding technology that is used as countering, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this could have been allowed to better mix in its surroundings and to deviate its enemies, say experts, which indicates that it was threatened by major dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of Nodosaurs has made headlines in May and now is now at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild beast and it was called Borealopelta striking Mark Mitchell, one of a team who spent more than 7.000 hours in order to uncover it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">The astounding conservation of the copy allowed the Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the patterns and form of dolls and armour about his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the counter shaded, a common defence method in the animal kingdom, which means that the leaders of the creature was darker than their underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the counter shaded is common, the results are surprising because the size of Borealopelta is by far the ones living in today."</seg>
<seg id="1945">It points out that the dinosaur of sufficient pressure by meat of the dinosaur dinosaurs was buried in the evolution of the confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most contemporary animals, which use the counter shaded - think of deer, zebras or girder - are much smaller and vulnerable as booty, which signalized that this Nodosrs was exposed to a true fight for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong smobtier behavior on a massive, strongly armored dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaurs have been to be the crayon time, said Brown."</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic connections in their skins also shows that the skin of the dinosaurs was brown.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists will continue to investigate the animal in references about his life, including his contemptor, to find out what it has eaten it to his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaur he died, into a river grated and went out into the sea, where he sank on the back to the bottom."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time Alberta was as warm as southern fluorida, and rivers and oceans probably spread much more inland than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurs is really remarkable because it is completely covered with contented skin, but also in three dimensions remains and the original form of the beast keeps it", "said Brown."</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal today looks almost as in the early wek period.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you do not need much imagination to use it to reconstruct it. if you only have a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that he is at sleep."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the chalk period was a time, when huge Theropoeia the, carnivorous dination, which stood on two legs, the earth was crossed."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, the tyrannosaurus Rex, millions of years after Borealopelta lived, the armored dinosaurs was hunted by some of his terrible ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"to this belongs to the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 feet (11,5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"scientists, whose latest findings appear in the Faculty of Current Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was failing after death in the sea and in mud."</seg>

<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the asterunned dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is complete from the muzzle to the thigh."</seg>

<seg id="2021">"just one day after it was arrived in New York City, sitting in St. Louis Geborene on the bed of an airbnb apartment, which they rented and scrollte by Facebook on their phone."</seg>
<seg id="2022">You stumbled upon a post by someone of the high school.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"the police have just killed a 18-year child, and it is still on the street, called it there."</seg>
<seg id="2024">"confused, since nobody else had posted the information on their feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the manual @ TheePharoah was constantly supplied on their Timeline retweetet.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"the Rapper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed by a white police in Ferguson, Mon., killed live."</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Browns lebrid body that was stretched on the road and would stay there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"this is wild, and thought of Ferrell."</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She placed her cell phone to return later in the evening to Tweets on the Canfield Drive later.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos of the police band and people who cried, and by a man who scored, Browns father to be a sign with the inscription:" Fergusons police have just killed my unarmed son! "</seg>
<seg id="2032">Watching a live Feed with which a policeman was standing in front of a group of demonstrators with an invertebdog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said, unattended another policeman his rifle and cried," I will kill you... animals all kill. "</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not common, remembered Ferrell on their statement."</seg>
<seg id="2035">That is not the kind of murder that we have used to accustomed to us and which we may have typical.</seg>
<seg id="2036">At this moment I felt Schüttgut.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">You booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After the landing at 23 o'clock she got her 6 year old daughter from the house of their father and decided that the two we would drive to Ferguson next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary film," Whose Streets? ", in the movies from the 11."</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a history of survival, and of the Protestants, the love and resistance, strength and resistance, which consists of the point of view of the human being, who live in the community and the streets are filled to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as a Ferrell with her daughter who carried a flower wedding and a suitable crown, after Ferguson drove the two a conversation that they had countless times before this morning, about the black experience and the black condition."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you did not remember how many people have taught you, when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "remember what she said."</seg>
<seg id="2044">"we now go to Ferguson, because the police have killed a 18-year-old boy and that was not right."</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take it to," said Ferrell later. "</seg>
<seg id="2046">That which is happening today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">You have to know it and see it and be moved in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed, not only activism and organization but also to know the various layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free to release ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I have fortunate to give you an experience, in which they experienced no noble racism, it is not different from the next black women-child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"I have the feeling, I would prove her a bad service to keep them away from it."</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first stop, when they arrived in Ferguson, was on the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which became a campground as the activists on the possible non-indictment of Officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"there, Ferrell and her daughter joined together with a local business proprietors, the lunch made."</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags before and helped to pass them to protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly started a new kind of activism for Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed totally after the 9th of August, she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and concentrated on eating justice and health inequalities in black communities."</seg>
<seg id="2056">"" "I had no experience in organizing."</seg>
<seg id="2057">It has all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later, Ferrell was met during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-director of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to be "documented" what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question came, Ferrell in the meaning:" do you want to document, or try to find a story that you can utilize? "</seg>
<seg id="2061">"these skepticism was nourished through countless cases of people, often from whites in a community that benefited from her pain and their resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan recently explained in an interview:" "we heard that people who were born in Ferguson and raised their voices and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had already collaborated with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area that is known for his activism around Todestrakt. "</seg>
<seg id="2064">His commitment brought Ferrell the project closer together with six other locals followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after browsing of shooting.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us. we talk," "Davis."</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me, as these people are represented, as I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was to concentrate on Ferrells experience - to show that it is with the movement" not about a Messiah leader, but about a community that comes together, "said Folayan - it proved to be the most obvious participant in the film."</seg>
<seg id="2068">"what do documents of" Whose Streets show? "surprising personal aspects of Ferrells life, as she loves herself and marries her wife."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed, when she saw the finished product for the first time. "</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I understood that there must be a certain vulnerability at this work and in the human being of black people.</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferrells has repeated history the role of black gay women in the wider black lives."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, which have shaped the film" "Blackberry Matter" in social media in 2012, identify themselves as sulul. "</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in executive positions have borne the movement in total," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women need to carry the main burden of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">Notice to notice that "the movement really is maintained by black women and many black women."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it consists of that" this is no affirmativer type of action, "when the Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who shook this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is no coincidence, although she was on the front line because with a life on these cruises as a black, gay woman so much on the game."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson are long since disappeared, but the racial connections between the church and the police continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is assassing for 2 ½ years due to the blockage of a highway in a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">"it describes the sociopolitical atmosphere of the area that she calls her home:" a mess. "</seg>
<seg id="2083">"nonetheless, she fade her vocals and she feels that memory, since she went to the street three years ago in Ferguson."</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We have to love each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "Sizer": TV-readers discuss about bit-gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">"the bit gallery moves the people, although it is not yet built for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the southern part of the pedestrian zone was switched on since the first presentation 2009 the population in advocates and opponents.</seg>
<seg id="2091">Cold leaves the subject hardly any.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"also on our Facebook-page" "People's" "and Bitburg" "is discussed."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"while the one to the bit gallery say:" that would be a dream "(Anja Becker) or" "that would be genuine class" "(Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side:" "does not need a man" "(Siggi Balls) or very simple:" size wahn! "" (Lars Scholz). "</seg>
<seg id="2094">"as the advocates to build out that a gallery will take more customers in the city, of which the remaining stores are benefited, fear the opponents, that then the pedestrian zone bleeding."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"added to the gallery, the gallery is planned exactly on the property, on which the peasant market hall is available in the 13 direct market."</seg>
<seg id="2096">With the beginning of the construction work will be an end.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The Galerie Macher want to integrate a market hall in the new building - and indeed for use with possibility of sitting outside sitting.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Rooms: "we have been buying nearly weekly in the market hall for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of landslides still very happy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Also the butcher we have discovered for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like to wish that during and especially after the construction of the gallery a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities it is also available.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting."</seg>
<seg id="2104">"Gerd Densing:" if direct it is marketed in a market hall in the gallery, comes to the amount of rent. "</seg>
<seg id="2105">"however, this is likely to be too low in the new project."</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "why is shopping in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">"clothing, shoes, drugging or supermarkets: I find that superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There are enough of them in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">One can see how many shoppers are here empty - some have been here for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but here it is not even a weekly weekend, it is all the more important that we remain at least the market hall."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the goods offered are freshly freshly, is mostly offered directly from the producer and is very purely inexpensive."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as one sees, shopstores are reserved in a shopping centre only by larger firms, because the dorm mities are often not portable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"too bad, special stores exist almost no more and that which is still left, then will probably disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping mall with a Markthalle that suits me not.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">First of all: where should the peasant market place during construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the old Edeka would be the solution - also on length, if the bit-gallery will actually happen."</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or creates it the ghost bit-gallery already before to expel all business from Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "this simply will not work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping center, that is empty, also no one needs."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real peasant market, instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"but for a peasant market hall it is thanks to the wahny many - as I find - sensual construction projects in Bitburg no place anymore."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"if the peasant market renovation is made, again a piece of culture will disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A suitable similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the room of Fridman Gallery in New York are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which hang almost indifferent - that on cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfar and Haircuts that were sent to you by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent the excerpts from the prison of Fort Leavenworth where the former secret service analyst had a 35-year imprisonment, after they made publicly proclaimed diplomatic reports about the site WikiLeaks."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition, opened on 2 August, is called A Becoming resemblance (A suitable similarity)."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"it is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline was united in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwife and groundbreaking Dissidents, whose condemnation of Barack Obama was transformed when he had only three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithms, the DNA, which could be extracted by Manning, and out of the 30 portraits, such as someone can interpret with these genomic data - the many ways as they can be interpreted and the indurated determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, which was born as Bradley Edward, but has already talked openly about identification as a woman since their puberty, was sentenced by 20 prosecution against espionagegnet, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"through the prison its picture was suppressed, so much that it was just a single photo - a stones, black-white selfie, in the Manning, sitting at an chassis and a platinblonde perch carries - with whom they were associated."</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came to the great success of her 2012-project "stranger Visions."</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in this produced the artist's portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts like ciget blebmel and chewing mi, extracted the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people might look like."</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an e-mail from a timagazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they led an interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," said Dewey-Hagborg at a press demonstration of the new exhibition. "</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she was not able to visit this time, and she could not take pictures, therefore they took contact with Chelsea, and asked them whether she wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and their detainted Muse were interfaded to unequal Bridges that were interchangeable in the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created one of Shoili Canungo illustrated comic" "Supplies Images", "which would foresee a future in which the president will convert its verdict, and it would be able to see the exhibition personally."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"that Obama was actually only few days after the book was released, Mannings release after seven brutal years in a military in Kansas, was a welcome type of lucky meeting."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also now at the opening of the exhibition a little deep and starkes, since Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the Governors and against transgender-troops to find new, aletable paths that it should actually fix, further to entangled."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"as Dewey-Hagborg after the strange Timing was asked for all of these things, she said that" things happen at a certain reason. "</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in one on the wall of the gallery, called Manning with her supergreat signature including (the" "i" "in her family name is provided with a heart) an end to the" automatic fragmentation, whose basis sex, race, sexuality and culture have been. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the facing wall its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousan of Cs and GS and As, in Pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped, by integrating the 200 letters (or Nukleotide to show the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist), how amazingly similar, at least in biological ways we are all."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people hopefully will participate, is that our genome does not take care of who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective them are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works of 2007, Spurious Memories, also to see. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, therefore the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition which is stored in an own room, is a page from the above mentioned Comic-Novelle."</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning as it emerges with a hand-call in the hand from the disciplines of the United States as king Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they face your speech, then they have won."</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so, never stop the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me," the artist said from Philadelphia. "</seg>
<seg id="2153">I'm still going to be godly when I talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning, the exhibition has not been seen personally - just as it should be prescient in the Comicbuch - but if they should do it, then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room of the masks, of their own genomic simulation, who together like hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"this was also focused on how all in the exhibition, up to the size (5" "2, Mannings Stature), where their genetic haploggroups were written with pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had it on the wall, but I wanted that they feel like a crowd of crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg from the portraits. "</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted that it feels like a mass movement that feels like Chelsea, as the movement, which also adfasted behind her liberation."</seg>

<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big deal.</seg>
<seg id="2392">"recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for responsible Robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robotic robots in the next five to ten years."</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, emeriter Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must start taking their rise seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye-color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of Fingernagel."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people think about them funny, but the businesses deliver every amount of it and we will see them much more frequently," said Mr. Sharkey on the release of his new report. "</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex dolls have developed from their inflatable partners to robotic partners with a silicon brick that feels warm - with deliberately human reactions that can be achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can also adjust its robot according to his beliefs, and select everything from the eye-color of the robot about the form of nipples up to the type or the color of his fingers."</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but it is still disturbing, as many robots possess the" personalities, "which would be a Stepford woman in a progressive way."</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex-dolls have turned on robots with a silicon skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the RealBotix robots makes it possible for example to adapt its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing like e.g. 'chternity."</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is still the root of True Companion developed Roxxxy Gold sex robots with pre-programmed personalities as "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of the scene and "Wild Wendy" with a "adventurous personality."</seg>

<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just a different sex tool."</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their creation and increasing refinement point out a little darker and deeper understanding in our culture to a withdrawal from the Ideal for gender equality towards sex with submission as optional addition.</seg>

<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robot is to establish a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (if also with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want to feel more humane that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, brought to the point when it comes to its" people, "the robots are not a real women."</seg>

<seg id="2437">"I find myself nowadays by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's Comneys, the dog on the autodach, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax statement looked) - both compared to Trump in fact, one as very mild strains."</seg>

<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">"but a new study claims the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and milk products, the symptoms of patients could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory intestinal diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable state that affects approximately 1,3 million and in the United Kingdom 300.000, caused by Magenkramps and blood, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"while those affected is normally to avoid flesh and dairy products, researchers found researchers at the Washingtoner University, that the essential amino acid pryptophan found to contribute to promoting immune cells that promote an tolerant intestine."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the introductory researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, declared that immunology at the gut patrol, to ensure that harmful microbes, which hide themselves in the food, not into the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">"cells, the imitation are, inflammation, are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without vulnerable fabric."</seg>
<seg id="2586">"if the balance is too far towards inflammation, it can result in a inflammatory intestinal diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments was observed that a kind of tolerance injury is found in mice that occurs a certain bacterium in their bowels.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the blocks of proteins - to dissolve the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" "we have a link between a bacterial and Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestine microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and one at Tryptophan rich foods tolerant, less inflammatory Darmmilieus supports, if the same system also acquires the same system."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the post-doorandin Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan undersearched a kind of immune cell that encourages the tolerance, when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but a different group of same trunk that was separated but separated."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"they assumed that the difference with the intestinal microbiomes of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and mushrooms, which usually live in the stomach-intestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">The harness of the mice have been DNA-sequencing and there were six bacterial species present in the mice with the immune cells but without them missing in the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">"mice were raised in a sterile environment, so that they were not developed a intestinal microbiome and they did not developed this kind of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"to understand how the bacteria reacting on the immune system, the researchers L. reuteri would grow in a fluid and then overled small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells that were isolated from the mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"when the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of the tryptophan-Metabolism that is known as Indol-3-Milk."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"if the researchers have doubled the quantity of tryptophan in the forage of mice double, the number of such cells have been halved by about 50 percent, but if the tryptophanvalues were halved, sank the number of cells by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">"Dr. Cervantes-Barragan said that people have the same tolerant cells such as mice, and that most of us L. reuteri protected in our stomach-intestines."</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether tryptophan-outproducts made of L. reuteri develop the cells in people like in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory intestinal diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said," The development of these cells is probably something that we would like to promote, since these cells control inflammations on the internal surface of the intestine. "</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially can lead high tryptopvalues in the presence of L. reuteri to an extension of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2716">"the green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs."</seg>
<seg id="2717">President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and officials of the White House made a tour of products from all over 50 states.</seg>
<seg id="2718">"the helicopter was posted in Connecticut, next to a yacht of Maine, a fireman from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi."</seg>
<seg id="2719">"the Military Office of the White House required the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FraGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter in the South Lawn landed, according to the records of Marine Helia Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit who is responsible for the operation of the helicopter."</seg>

<seg id="2726">Records indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the purpose.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"a question we asked, was whether it was a violation of Hatch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case," wrote the commander. "</seg>

<seg id="2729">"the event" "Made in America" "was designated by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by Hatch Act."</seg>

<seg id="2731">"on the event, the president gave an impetus to reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate, and he propagated the efforts for the incorporation of government regulations."</seg>

<seg id="2746">The White House argued that the actual cost of running the helicopter is far below that rate.</seg>

<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen report to the abuse-cases populated Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This means author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report to abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen continues for discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">"Christian Weisnder, speaker of the reform movement" We are Church "," declared by former Regensburger Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the dominal Master Ratzinger, the 93-year brother of the emeried Pope Benedict XVI. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">"it would be a reputation for the Catholic Church, if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret about their own understandings or their then false estimate of the processes."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"the Vatican Council" Osservatore Romano, "however, criticized that during the reporting of violence in the Domspatzen with" two measurements "." "</seg>
<seg id="2895">"with regard to the grips in Regensburg, nobody knows that it would be punished for" shameful and shameful actions "," which would be punished and prevented in the future; but the "degree of medial Manipulation," says the author of Lucie Scaraffia, historian and a member of the national Italian bioethics committee. "</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit that describe the Catholic Church as a source of all evil, is already part of the everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal for normal", "writes Scaraffia."</seg>
<seg id="2897">Also Fürstin Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said in the interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: "we are happy to go to the church and that's a tily connected.</seg>
<seg id="2898">"moreover, it pointed out that in her youth" saw a very normal educational means "," to be with friends, as I was one, ready to be done. "</seg>
<seg id="2899">They're unfair to use today's standards in earlier decades as the world have changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">"in connection with reports on the abuse cases, often Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger often emerged."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"totally to unright, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who has been translated with Ratzinger" "My brother of Pope" "(in 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I must take Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "for all that had nothing to do with him," he used the outcome of the final report. "</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly stands in the 440-page report that was presented by the diocese Regensburg with the Enchment attorney Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"a total of 2,547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s" with high plausibility "victims of grips, 67 Domspatzen sexually abused."</seg>
<seg id="2905">"the final report is said to Georg Ratzinger, who worked from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg:" "in conclusion, that by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially at high Emotionality the treatment could also become vehement for the students.</seg>
<seg id="2907">"nevertheless, contrary to numerous other accusations, that many victims still cherished the common humanity of R., and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence even having positive memories with it."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in the interview, Hesemann, why the Final Report on the abuse of the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger was in his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr. Hesemann, the 440-Pages report about the" Prefailures of violence "at the Regensburger Domspatzen" gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">"to one lift many students of his" humanity. ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"on the other, he also appears as cholerance and perfectionist who was palply designed in the Öfteren when a Domspatz was not a top performance."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate as its biographer this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: when you read the trouble and reads all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back, one has to wonder why the name Georg Ratzinger was at all in it."</seg>
<seg id="2914">It is dedicated to him eight pages and he is clearly released by any suspicion of the mediate or pedestal in the terrible cases sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">"also, the non-violence show at the pre-school uniting out of its efficiency."</seg>
<seg id="2916">One can imagine it at best to get out of it too late or take the first hint not seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the cathedryer of the school, in which he worked, was felt by nearly all Beaches as - so literally -" salvation "," "heaven" and "better world". ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"thus, the vast majority of his students, Georg Ratzinger presents him a very excellent record," "loved", "" sincerely, "," competently, "" competently "," and "comprehensible", "which the guys regularly revolted with cakes, biscuits and Bonbons supplies and" always by grapes from children. "</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complaining about his perfectionism and his high exorality that led to wound-brood also already.</seg>
<seg id="2920">"that he was not only bowed with chairs and bowls and bowls the bowls, but also earthy guys in the hair or ears, he has left them even more years ago, deeply regret and apologized for it."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"to his honorary salvation, however, must be said that such educationmethods in the fragile time, the 1960s and 1970s have been widely used, with parents like by instructors."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding-methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think everyone of us was born before 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I have seen this still in a worldly school, a state of Gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what it is actually going on in this report, namely the primary sexual abuse and non-violence at the pre-school, are the non-violent dredelling."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"if you ask yourself if it is not more likely to do with his familiarity and his role as the brother of Benedict XVI, that many media has just crashed on him."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"on the Bavarian pope, so many who have never understood it, nor ever-freezing."</seg>
<seg id="2928">The truth is: the Relaunching Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in connection with the report, a lot about the issue of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger in the Final Report as well as any reversibility or co-operation with regard to sexual abuse to the load?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: very clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual grips claims to have become familiar with the dominal master.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I have never drunk to talk to my father or my mother," "said a Betener repressions for the others," It was all very embarrassing. "</seg>
<seg id="2935">"the true issue in clarification of sexual abuse was, and is however, that most victims are not silent."</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they do not even become parents and siblings, then certainly not a choral leader, who would certainly have been a colleague of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do you rate the Domspatzen students Ratzingers role in terms of misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionist student formulate it so: "regarding sexual abuse... I do not see any case in which he could have had timely insights and had to stop the respective perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I think it... also for really absurd to accept that it rested on him... Buben impregnable or clearer or more rather, as compared to their parents, boarding, trust, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - unthinkable.</seg>
<seg id="2941">"thus the report comes to the very clear result:" "that in advance concerned students and / or their environment, could not be confirmed within the framework of the examination."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"what sexual abuse affects, Georg Ratzinger is therefore free of everyone."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"thus he cannot be thrown into it, nor may it be prevented or advert."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore there is no reason to bring his good name with these residual crimes, as unfortunately it happened in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">The media was much of "nonviolence" at the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger will look forward to the report "path."</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that in the reporting everything revolves and deceives to a huge melange taken out of sexual abuse and nonviolence and somewhere, in the midst of, Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"yet, that is precisely the abuse of the report."</seg>
<seg id="2950">"namely, it will be clean separated: between the pre-school and the grammar school, between sexual abuse and non-violence, as well as we say to other preaches."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report also deals dating from the period since 1945, i.e. for four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not a choral leader."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole terrible auditing Pedagogy, the cases, in which Knaben were controlled by sadistic teachers and maligned and underslated themselves at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really skandalous stators have to have heard."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with whom had Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, because he got the boy only to face, when they had already been on the dominities."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on this was, how the alleged witnesses accentuate witnesses, the topic" "Pre-School" "tabu."</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was just happy to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even 'heavenly "states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different in the dominities?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hesemann: there was already discipline, but there is no sadic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report comes to the conclusion that" many victims would cherished the common humanity of R., and therefore in many cases, despite violence even having positive memories with it. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">"so, at most still the reaccusation remains, away."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"despite all efforts, the report was able to define only two periods in which it was reported from the states at the pre-school."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish itself and was responsible for the events at a school, which he was just not working and responsible (so the witness) didn't want to hear, and then again in 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Verlock Georg Ratzinger in front of the states consistently the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the domescretory of the cathedral, who even reproduces the report."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this, he pointed out this to that in the pre-school continued to be practiced."</seg>
<seg id="2965">"even in view of the danger of negative presences, he recommended urgent intimidation."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"of course, this was at a time, as a legal clarity consisted, as the testing was also being banned in Bavaria too."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before doing it, they were in a legal gray area, as everyone of us probably know."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"there was also difficult to estimate for him, where the sufferers may be exaggerated or dramatized, and where really the permissible limit was exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="2969">"but one cannot say, he would have always taken away."</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is just not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">"only in 1980, the test was officially completed in Bavaria too."</seg>
<seg id="2972">"Fürstin Gloria of Thurn und Taxis haried yes, it is unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards for the damaltime period."</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we historian talking about" "pitfalls of Anachronism", "i.e. the danger, last to present days of today's moral scale."</seg>
<seg id="2975">Since has the princess already right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"this is of course not true for sexual abuse, who was at all times abomable and also not for what is broken down in the pre-school for resistance and violence against innocents, which goes far beyond that time."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"this is all very terrible, and I am glad that it will finally be reworked."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time, I must take the Georg Ratzinger, for all that had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his means for disciplinence and cutters, i.e. earrings and to pull together in the hairs, and ears were widely spread in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"when bodily existence was then banned, he has also kept strictly with it."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"what image of his Regensburger time has Georg Ratzinger, because in the talks with you for the book" "My brother of Pope" "?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the topic test also for language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI., told his perspective, and the Domspatzen played only a secondary role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I am not at all that he led a strictly Regiment there."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but even that must be said once again: without these perfectionism, without the undemanding discipline, it would hardly have been possible, from the until then rather nationalistic Regensburger Domspatzen an institution of Weldg forms, true cultural botanical garden of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with Keksen and Bonbons alone, one does not make a big singer and stand out of any success in which area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming."</seg>
<seg id="2987">As what kind of man did you experience Georg Ratzinger for talks about their book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond that I experienced Georg Ratzinger again and again lived as a wonderful, humorous, basic, deep, deep and hearty people, from which one could not imagine that he could do just a fly something to him."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I come regularly with how many former Domspatzen still come to him today, 23 years after its Emeritus, regularly contact him to read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who do not forgive him up to date, that he was once strictly speaking to them, are therefore clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the Domspatzen are thankful to him today that he enriched their lives and took care of the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he always had a good, vocalist teacher - a stringent father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovable respect, to which she still had to look at this day and to honor it."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once again very clearly: everything you are throws are educative, which were then on the order of the day."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have long overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is highly unjust, a man, just because he is prominently and has a very prominent brother to make the medial scapegoats."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"there is the nasty intent that stands behind it, just too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"the report, which has just been released, overloaded him."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the decency today would have acquired a 93 year old man who has acquired great merits and without the outside of Bavaria, and perhaps Germany, no one would like to know the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
