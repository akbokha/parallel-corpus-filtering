this made the Hollywood star in an interview now un@@ ambiguous .
&quot; I will always put in drawers , or be@@ ating from the outside label that have usually little to do with me and the reality . &quot;
&quot; I myself don &apos;t have the desire , always perfect and successful . &quot;

&quot; J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only lau@@ gh it as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; , &quot; as it is explained in the current &quot; Cos@@ m@@ opol@@ itan &quot; . &quot; &quot;

gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the Sport@@ pyramid
his experience on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
&quot; at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger sought a bit of variety with some colleagues a bit of variety with a horseback riding on the beach . &quot;
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; Golden Sport@@ pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a few minutes , the horses rem@@ inded themselves at their holiday , they ch@@ asing the quick stop at home to the feeding . &quot;
&quot; a kilometer at this speed , I have been afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger . &quot;
and with this the equ@@ est@@ rian career ended then again .
on Saturday there was a best gol@@ fer of all times - 101 tournament si@@ ege - back in the near of horses .
he left with his family about the installation of the AL@@ RV on a horse he is not able to con@@ quer photo .
&quot; for a long time , the first time in Aachen and it was also at CH@@ IO . &quot;
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sport en@@ rol@@ ment the man from An@@ hausen in the framework of a small Gala of the Golden World Pyr@@ amid .
in distin@@ ctions it lacks the sympath@@ etic ath@@ l@@ ete .
&quot; Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreu@@ z , sil@@ ber@@ nes Lor@@ be@@ er@@ blatt , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ... &quot;
even the British Queen has already led him .
a long is the 18th Prize winner of the Sport@@ pyramid .
&quot; at Aachen , he met at the Saturday the first prize of Hans Günter Win@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; this award means to me a lot , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; for it is not only awarded for spor@@ tive achievements , but also for social engagement . &quot;
for decades Lan@@ ger promotes the off@@ spring .
&quot; and so he gave the discount of 25,000 euros as well . &quot;
&quot; with 15 other outstanding spor@@ tsmen , the two @-@ fold U.S. Masters was recorded on Saturday in the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports . &quot; &quot;
&quot; among the excellent include the lightweight Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , der Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard G@@ ien@@ ger , who wonder@@ ed Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ru@@ do@@ ka Frank Wien@@ eke , the Spring@@ do@@ ka Frank Wien@@ eke , the Spring@@ Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ ö@@ hle and pos@@ th@@ um the Hand@@ b@@ aller Erhard . &quot;
&quot; many of these spor@@ tsmen have arrived on Saturday to Aachen . &quot;
&quot; after the official part emig@@ rated the illustr@@ ative society to the Spring@@ stadium , where the Lav@@ azza @-@ Prize ran . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger held a distance to the big animals .
Cl@@ int@@ ons and Tru@@ mp@@ s economic policies compared : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and prevent trade agreements T@@ TP - they want both Clinton and Tru@@ mp .
&quot; however , the two US presidential elections are reflected in the tax and energy policy , as well as in a critical query . &quot;
&quot; the differences in the economic policy between Donald Tru@@ mp and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a basic , rather philosoph@@ ical difference . &quot;
&quot; the , on the role of the state . &quot;
Tru@@ mp wants to keep in doubt rather small and war@@ ned of how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations .
Clinton wants to ga@@ ze the economy to death and regulate in death he says .
&quot; he himself would be quite different , maintains Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; he will be massi@@ vely with@@ ered , and he is committed to far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower control movements - for individuals and for companies . &quot;
&quot; Clinton on the contrary , says : the state has specific tasks to open , he has given disadvantage opportunities and needs money . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the taxes would increase in the rich , says it . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in the m@@ ses to be invested , Tru@@ mp and Clinton are almost adverti@@ sed . &quot;
the democratic rating will be the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in the infrastructure are classical democratic policy and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical Te@@ apart@@ y @-@ wing of the Republi@@ can .
on Tru@@ mp could therefore be part of internal discussions .
clearly are the differences in energy and climate policies .
Tru@@ mp aims to build coal @-@ power plants and drive the coal production in the US again .
oil production should also be possible in so far @-@ protected areas that he wants to announce the Paris climate protection agreement .
&quot; in contrast , Clinton wants to expand the Renewable Energy Investment Programme and calls for : &quot; &quot; a country will create the super@@ power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
&quot; but not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far away from each other . &quot;
&quot; T@@ PP , the d@@ rank @-@ fish trade agreement , both do not want to sign . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both , however , do not want to isol@@ ate the USA from international trade , but just to protect American jobs better . &quot;
&quot; the should then also be paid better , calling for Clinton . &quot;
the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a hungry .
it wants to increase it on 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; what Tru@@ mp wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage has to be , then he says , he does not likely to be changed . &quot;
but the great discussion of the coming months is likely to be likely to develop the tax policy of both camps .
&quot; on one side stands Tru@@ mp , who wants to boost the economy and the citizens to boost growth . &quot;
&quot; his critics stop him , so that the household defic@@ it would just be even bigger . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand Clinton , who want to ask at least from the rich that they pay more taxes , and their critics : more taxes are not the solution . &quot;
escape : &quot; every mature woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
&quot; sexual violence belongs to women who fle@@ e alone , almost to everyday life . &quot;
&quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed . &quot;
a house provides refu@@ ge .
in a large kitchen sitting four women .
each has a baby at most one year old .
one has laid her little son in her arms .
he gu@@ ed with great eyes curious to the room .
his mother died on the table .
until they notice that they are observed .
she sm@@ iles short and kis@@ sing the little .
the scene works normal .
to speak with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; it is the cur@@ ator of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social assistance offers in Bavaria , and deals with the topic of women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are refugees .
they live in Mün@@ ch@@ ner North in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alised accommodations for all women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs established the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Mün@@ ch@@ ner &apos;s Assistant .
&quot; unfortunately , it was officially opened . &quot;
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men are not there - also not as visitors .
the exception is a guard to the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has done on her flight experiences with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men fle@@ e because of wars , because they are politically prosec@@ uted because they thre@@ aten torture or death or because their families send her as a hope for a glimp@@ se of Europe . &quot;
&quot; in women wei@@ gh other reasons for the escape , &quot; many ste@@ al is secre@@ tly , because they do not see any other way . &quot;
&quot; in their home they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , volunte@@ ering , slavery , or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
this continues it away .
on the run it goes on .
&quot; that tu@@ gs for example for a bottle of water demand a sexual act is not rar@@ ity , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families . &quot;
&quot; who believe that the end once they anchor in Germany , ir@@ re , tells B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; even here , women were often considered to be under@@ estimated and worse women were ab@@ used in refugees and worse . &quot;
&quot; this leads to that about 90 percent of women who live in the house in Mün@@ ch@@ ner North , trau@@ mati@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; some of the children are certainly not written voluntarily . &quot;
many women are so special that they say nothing .
&quot; or they don &apos;t want to speak openly about the experience , because the shame is too big . &quot;
&quot; since they are often not able to help , find it more accommodations just for them , requires B@@ ahr . &quot;
in Bavaria the seven District regi@@ sters for the accommodation of refugees is responsible .
&quot; the question whether they live from a similar project such as in Munich in its jurisdiction range , answers a few with no . &quot;
&quot; in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz region and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there is such a thing in shel@@ ters of governments . &quot;
&quot; even in Schw@@ aben alone , women are not separated alone , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , Press@@ es@@ pre@@ cher of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Bavaria , Lower and mid @-@ sized people there are some common floors , or own houses only for all women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women . &quot;
also the Committee &quot; Rights of Women and Gender Equality &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women need to be accommo@@ dated from men .
&quot; in a study that was released for the Committee , it is said : &quot; it is very important that men and women are separate . &quot;
&quot; lack of privacy or being accommo@@ dated men and women , there may be - continuous - violence against women . &quot;
&quot; especially the washing rooms should be separated and for women be easily accessible , is available in the study . &quot;
&quot; how much the women can feel this protective needs , one can proceed to the cr@@ ush , which there is in the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; ever since have spoken , that there is us , we have a long queue , &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
it could easily make a second house .
assistance impl@@ ements : demands for new working amp@@ hibi@@ tive actions
&quot; dep@@ uty members of the assistant have called their trade union , new work amp@@ hibi@@ tive measures in their disputes with respect to a new contract . &quot;
&quot; the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( B@@ MA ) has demanded its entire council , from the beginning of September more labour @-@ fighting measures . &quot;
&quot; the J@@ DC said that it had taken minister , to deal with the concerns of the contract . &quot;
&quot; assistant and medical students have agreed in July about the rejection of a contract , which was agreed with the B@@ MA . &quot;
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members , who was published on Thursday night on Twitter , said the president of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court , that the government would have remained stable &quot; &quot; what led to problems that the treaty was rejected . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; considering this , the J@@ DC Board voted , the proposed new treaty completely reject and rep@@ lic@@ ated official re@@ negotiations with all those concerned . &quot;
&quot; as an answer to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board has provided a formal application for a special meeting of the B@@ MA , in order to have a run programme of escal@@ ating work measures , the beginning of September begins . &quot;
&quot; the dispute led to this , that assistant this year six@@ sm@@ al strikes , the first total fail@@ ures in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
&quot; the leader of the B@@ MA Assistant Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana was elected to the election of the agreed contractual conditions , which were recommended by the B@@ MA . &quot;
&quot; he shared B@@ MA members during the sessions , who still took place before the vote by 54.@@ 000 Assistant and medical students , with that the contract should be beneficial and approved . &quot;
&quot; following the vote , the Health Minister Jerem@@ y Hunt , that the Treaty of doctors in England would be launched in the UK . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : a &quot; Alliance of outside fail &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
&quot; the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give rise to the hands , and to announce an official end of eight months long @-@ term war of words and economic sanctions . &quot;
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counter@@ player in the gold @-@ plated Hall of St. Pet@@ ers@@ burger Pal@@ ast@@ es in reception , I can not deny myself to the in@@ scrip@@ ture that Ankara wants to take this reconciliation . &quot;
&quot; it gave the manual , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin in sm@@ iles , dirty , and he was hardly heat out , even for his back @-@ long relationships . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an , in contrast , spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; - according to a report all five times . &quot;
I could not count it anymore .
&quot; he also spoke that relations with Russia would return not only to its old level before the crisis , but even better to improve . &quot;
&quot; on the next day a newspaper , that Erd@@ og@@ an had gotten so ben@@ ign , as if it would never happen . &quot;
me seemed to be my enthusiasm rather the opposite .
&quot; but one of Putin @-@ radi@@ ant , sustainable cooling showed that the head of Russia had nothing forgotten . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory lecture : the shot of a Russian figh@@ ter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot;
Moscow from reaction to time was w@@ ut@@ ent@@ angl@@ ed .
Putin shared and acc@@ used Ankara to have Russia in the back .
&quot; the failure was even bigger , since it was committed by a supposed friend . &quot;
&quot; the c@@ ous@@ ing to rebuild it becomes difficult , if not even impossible . &quot;
the public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months , the nation@@ ally controlled media led a fier@@ ce , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
&quot; at once , it seemed as would the Turks apply to all the blame . &quot;
&quot; in the most sought the alleg@@ ations of leading officials , that Erd@@ og@@ an has benef@@ ited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria , which might be controlled by the so @-@ called Islam@@ ic state . &quot;
he has denied this veh@@ em@@ ently .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
&quot; after all , this meeting took place only because Putin received from the President Erd@@ og@@ an the exc@@ use he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia could win a sort of victory .
for Ankara the benefits of a cease @-@ fire is clear on the hand .
Erd@@ og@@ an needs first and all friends who he can get after spending last month at a failed state @-@ rich almost his ministry .
re@@ peti@@ tive terrorist attacks to Turkey have also sh@@ aken him .
but there are also economic moti@@ fs .
&quot; Russian sanctions have hit Turkey - especially the prohibition of charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year . &quot;
the number is gone by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , travel agency and charter companies will be facilit@@ ated when the flights are recorded again . &quot;
it is one of the bel@@ ong@@ ated An@@ no@@ is@@ ans in the Mediterranean .
this week progn@@ os@@ ed the state remot@@ ely cheap fruits and vegetables that once the Turkish agr@@ arian are to be allowed again .
&quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti form@@ ulate the following : &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry in the West as it is his reaction to the tried of power over a weak response .
&quot; to this end , the continued Gro@@ ll about the Sn@@ ail of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ pi@@ ke on it is to move from the cool mood and to reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West . &quot;
&quot; in Ankara , the Russian state of State won a bonus for sure that he called for the elected government authorities for the elected government organs . &quot;
&quot; this is well @-@ made for Moscow , a matter of course , that has changed a deep fear of rain . &quot;
&quot; the summit in this sh@@ iny palace was made by the sea in Russia and Turkey , one as it once formed a analy@@ st &quot; &quot; Alliance of aliens &quot; &quot; : two countries which can emerge from the West and have been trou@@ bled themselves . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two still . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently been the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support oppos@@ ing sides . &quot;
&quot; it could be ap@@ preh@@ end that after nearly three hours of initial talk , both presi@@ dents on the press conference said that they had not even gest@@ ures the subject . &quot;
the President of Turkey was apparent to answer a question about their differences while Putin decided to stress this .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months open enm@@ ity - and in view of the potential for a perfect dis@@ aster , when the NATO @-@ member of Turkey had the Russian battle jet - it is certainly better that the two states have at least once again talk together . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland is no longer available
the R@@ BS brand should be reduced to a back@@ office role according to the Direc@@ tor@@ ch of the Bank .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland with that the R@@ BS brand associated with the global ambitions of the bank .
the Bank has since itself distances itself when she had nearly joined together almost eight years ago and had to be saved .
at this time we have used br@@ anding &quot; R@@ BS &quot; to protect other end users .
they supported the international sport with millions of pound to sponsor@@ ing , from the Six Nations Rug@@ by up to the Wim@@ bl@@ edon winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she has decided to put more national brands in focus .
&quot; the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized . &quot;
in England and Wales all RS@@ B references are the head@@ quarter head@@ quarter and the stock exchange to so@@ west .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are other smaller brands for the private customer business , which will be more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dru@@ m@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a tour tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Sh@@ ire .
&quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; the RS@@ B &quot; &quot; brand will become our Invest@@ ors &quot; brand as well as the brand , among which our employees will be employed , as we are now more to a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; when the bank has become a global brand , R@@ BS has become a global brand . &quot;
&quot; now , I say that we do not pursue global goals , but local targets . &quot;
each of these brands will stand completely different in their own congreg@@ ations for something completely different and our employees will work with the customers under these brands .
R@@ BS has already said that it will not continue his Six Nations sponsorship for the Six and that it will increase the perception of different brands in his sport sponsorship .
&quot; it is time for us to develop to the bank of the brands , as we focus on within ( we have asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; said the fore@@ heads . &quot;
&quot; it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal for three years ago , if we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and these brands have been ab@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , think I will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can restore these brands again , so I think that the time has come . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori achieved on Pre@@ dil@@ ection with his 3.@@ 000@@ ten prize at New@@ market
&quot; D@@ ett@@ ori spra@@ yed Champagne after a Double at New@@ market , who brings him 3,@@ 000@@ th win &quot;
the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori assured on Friday his 3.@@ 000@@ ten British prize at New@@ market .
&quot; he sat down on Pre@@ dil@@ ection , which is trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local rac@@ et@@ rack with his second win of the night a milestone . &quot;
&quot; the 45 @-@ year Itali@@ ans is the sixth Jo@@ ckey , which reaches the milestone in the low@@ race . &quot;
&quot; he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ nat@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Willi@@ e Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; the three @-@ month winner D@@ ett@@ ori won before that on G@@ ha@@ y@@ yar said , &quot; &quot; It is something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is also here
&quot; I am very happy about that at New@@ market , because I joined more than 30 years ago . &quot;
&quot; it is not a great meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it is a ban@@ ker Friday evening with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very hum@@ ble .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the itch to win the victory in Pre@@ dil@@ ection
&quot; two Jo@@ ck@@ eys have reached the milestone in the barriers - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the pen@@ sion@@ ed 20 @-@ painting winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who reached more than 4,@@ 300 vic@@ tories in a recur@@ ring career . &quot;
L@@ ester Pig@@ nat@@ t the ninth @-@ coloured Der@@ b@@ ysi@@ eger had 4.@@ 4@@ 93 care@@ ers
Frank@@ ie is one of the best yo@@ ckey of the modern age and it is no surprise that he reached this milestone just a few before him .
&quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intell@@ ect that differs from the others in the weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic amb@@ assador for races , his enthusiasm and char@@ isma loved fans already for years for this sport . &quot;
&quot; I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som , that he had already fet@@ ched 6,000 wins if he would not only be a weekend and grandfather &quot;
Frank@@ ie has already suffered nearly 30 years of winning in the UK - what is great .
&quot; he has a living personality , which is good for a bri@@ tish race , but in addition he is an incredible Jo@@ ckey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; by Flying Fin@@ ishes on Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flag@@ ship of the British flat for two decades . &quot;
it was anno@@ ying .
&quot; a whole series of wholes@@ ale win , including its famous &quot; Gl@@ or@@ rich Si@@ eben &quot; &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug . &quot;
&quot; three years ago he had at first difficulties when he returned from his sixth row , but he showed an impressive intensity to return his doubts , and to return to his best form . &quot;
and he is not yet at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori once said he wants to continue with competitions up to his at least 50.@@ ten years .
Russian Putin feu@@ dal Stab@@ ili@@ ef Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
the Russian president Vladimir Putin has un@@ wa@@ ited his Stab@@ ili@@ ef Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was many years of the most eng@@ ths of trust in Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed as special contrac@@ tor for environmental and transport issues .
&quot; in an opinion of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , it is that Putin has arranged by his obligations as chairman of the Russian presidential management . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o who was dep@@ uty since 2012 Ivan@@ ov &apos;s dep@@ uty was appointed to his successor .
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 1972 born 1972 in the Estonian capital of Tallinn , he made his conclusion at the renowned State Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) , and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo . &quot;
on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin it is called ( in Russian ) that he later was later log @-@ chief and department manager of the government .
&quot; he said to Putin , &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot;
&quot; I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as a state of state , and to support controls for the implementation of your instructions . &quot;
Putin shared the Russian TV stations on Friday with that Ivan@@ ov asked for to leave his post and advised V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the smiling faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the eng@@ est familiar Vladimir Putin &apos;s and works as he works for the Soviet intelligence service , the K@@ GB . &quot;
he was one of the most powerful men of the country .
&quot; with a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on TV , both men claimed that the Stab@@ sch@@ ef returned on his own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the lungs for the cameras , here are only a few of them - especially before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
so here is the result of a kind of power competition ?
this is no one at all times .
but the official statement - that a man who once was once more pronounced as a potential president to once forward the Russian environmental policy - came across a great sc@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism .
&quot; in his remarks on Putin , who are quoted on the Kre@@ m@@ lin website , Ivan@@ ov said it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - I could almost say - compl@@ aining about four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential management for four years and eight months . &quot;
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin &apos;s former member of the State Security Council of K@@ GB .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Council ( FSB ) was that appointed the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his dep@@ uty . &quot;

Queens@@ ferry Cros@@ sing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1,35 billion project will be completed until May 2017
engineers have linked the Nord@@ deck by the Queens@@ ferry cross@@ ings with the vi@@ a@@ duct which means that the bridge is now connected with fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four con@@ cluding the &quot; &quot; covers &quot; , &quot; which to approach each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
the bridge @-@ cut of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 tons .
&quot; it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 sl@@ anted . &quot;
the £ 1,35 billion project will be completed until May 2017 .
&quot; N@@ eit@@ h Brown held the construction site today and was one of the first , which went from the country to the bridge . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Queens@@ ferry cross@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; we are all witnesses of an engineer , from a truly ep@@ ic degree in this project with over 3@@ 0,000 tons of concrete and steel that have been used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the sl@@ ender is between the vi@@ a@@ duct and the Br@@ ück@@ ende@@ ck a hom@@ ely activity , which require extremely accurate toler@@ ances for the fit . &quot;
&quot; in total , almost 79 % of the total ende@@ aring at their place and the last section of the de@@ cks is now available in Ros@@ y@@ th a Bet@@ ong@@ ings for the deck , which means that the entire Deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to his place . &quot;
Michael Martin , Project Le@@ aders of For@@ th Cros@@ sing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first cl@@ asp is a significant milestone in each bridge project . &quot;
in this fantastic project the con@@ sign@@ alling high@@ - and deep @-@ building stands out .
&quot; after the installation of the final street section and its connection with the north@@ side of the North @-@ deck , we had to close the still existing gap on the north or shore . &quot;
this was achieved by drag@@ ging the northern fe@@ eder bridge 700 milli@@ meter south .
this was a massive and at the same time very hom@@ ely activity .
&quot; massive because the Vi@@ a@@ duct is 222 meters long , weighs approx . 6,000 tonnes weighs and had to be drag@@ ged at a gradient of about 3 % . &quot;
&quot; hom@@ age , since the toler@@ ances that works on which the team works , tiny - on each side they buried only a few millimeters . &quot;
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men still have good fortune to be alive &quot;

who is Braunschweig favourable apartments ?
the SPD and Green believe : investors should be much stronger in the future .
how does one react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments in the coming years ?
the SPD strikes a &quot; act concept in the next council meeting . &quot;
but contro@@ vers@@ y is programmed .
first and foremost about the question : who is supposed to build the cheap apartments actually ?
a regulation is missing .
&quot; SPD Group president Christoph Brat@@ mann means : &quot; &quot; we are holding us with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban areas will have to point 20 percent of all the apartments as a social housing . &quot;
&quot; however , the favorable apartments may also be drawn in the continu@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; but the great dispute point in the city hall is , however , as Brat@@ mann : &quot; how do you want to build investors who want to build on private areas ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors to build on such areas at least 10 percent , but as possible 20 per cent of the apartments as a social housing . &quot;
&quot; a new municipal house @-@ building program , which will cost millions of cost and must be financed , must provide incentives for incentives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , so viol@@ mann : &quot; there is currently no agreement between the groups . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few as possible .
the left wants to be hardness as well as for investors .
&quot; regardless of this , so viol@@ mann , ba@@ its is a shar@@ pen@@ ing of the situation on the residential market . &quot;
&quot; the action concept is implemented , which will ensure additional tasks in the management administration . &quot;
more staff is needed .
it is un@@ clear whether we get the experts .
&quot; still the program is not entirely : because the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot;
&quot; how does one compar@@ ing the loss of further around 1300 cheap apartments , which will run over the next few years ? &quot;
&quot; until the year 2020 , there will be 500 apartments . &quot;
&quot; to prevent this , as the plan@@ atory sp@@ okes@@ person Nicole Palm , should now be sold out of the city . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would have to be asked to return apartments back into the pricing . &quot;
this is possible in the west town .
on one fell sw@@ oop the problem solve .
because at the west town the beginning of the year are already running .
around 1800 apartments you could get there back into the pricing for cheap apartments .
&quot; only : they do not want the owners , the housing societies not . &quot;
&quot; because the number of social housing in the west town is increased dramatically , one is removed from the target of the so @-@ called mix @-@ mix . &quot;
there should no longer be a concentration of social weak in just a few city districts .
the Gre@@ ens expect that there will be even movement in the discussion .
&quot; Group Leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke means : &quot; for a vast majority , the CD@@ U must take the boat . &quot;
&quot; these have been concentrated on more construction sites for family homes . &quot;
but what does not mean that a compromise can not yet be found .
Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go - a hunt for health and luck that worth it
it is fascinating to watch how the world changes .
&quot; that teenage children and children are no longer going out for playing outside , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time on screens on screens , was charged in the last decade of many . &quot;
&quot; at Po@@ k@@ emon Go it &apos;s about to get people from the sofa and to make active more active . &quot;
&quot; the time on the screen was initially limited to TV , then on video games and most recently restricted to smartphones . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mut@@ ually exclusive . &quot;
&quot; I look forward to the Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that were created on the characters which were created first for video games in the 1990s ( later this creates a string series , playing cards and other spin @-@ off@@ s ) . &quot;
&quot; how many phenomena of popular culture rank the interest before the publication of the game in the US , Australia and New Zealand in early July . &quot;
the market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by massive demand that over@@ load the server .
within a few days Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than ink and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , the players with their smartphone are going out and search for Po@@ k@@ é@@ m@@ ons who are following with a GPS and once they were found , &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; ( about a screenshot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game , when she was still younger , closed the w@@ ahn and sp@@ rang for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the US the game led to a considerable increase in steps , which returns the &quot; average &quot; person every day . &quot;
&quot; Cardi@@ og@@ ram , an app for Apple Watch that followed 3@@ 5.000 users recently released that within two days of launch of the game , the number of j@@ ump@@ ed people , which exercise every day 30 minutes , from 45 percent to 53 per cent . &quot;
the company does not know who plays Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go - it just sees the raw data to increase performance .
&quot; many public awareness campaigns to health , people want to bring &quot; &quot; 30 minutes &quot; to come &quot; &quot; from the sofa to come &quot; and &quot; every day to be active &quot; sti@@ cking on num@@ b ears , because many public messages are boring to health and come from people who look like . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sport can not be assessed . &quot;
&quot; who regularly drives sports , reduces its opportunities to treat cancer or depression . &quot;
&quot; physical activity helps in the weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here . &quot;
but the wonder@@ full of Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors .
&quot; thus , three pillars of health covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun . &quot;
some people join the hunt even new friend@@ ships .
&quot; as always there is also m@@ ür@@ cher game , which must always complain about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could walk against a door . &quot;
what is it ?
it has a breakthrough .
&quot; even if Smartphone @-@ Apps like Fit@@ Bit could already follow our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to do sport as it does this game . &quot;
the new will lose its matur@@ ation and use it with time .
&quot; however , because of Po@@ k@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , there will be more games to be combined the apps and virtual reality with the activities will be combined in the real world and will help people in hunting , active , f@@ itter and health@@ ier . &quot;

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ entur@@ ine
forget the pressure .
forget the mort@@ gage .
Simone Bil@@ es is on all the imm@@ un .
dynamic on the spr@@ ing@@ horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
breathtaking on the floor .
on the entire line brilliant .
and now finally the Olympi@@ ad .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American Tur@@ ner@@ in er@@ kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday to the multi @-@ portrait and enlarged the gap between themselves and the rest of the world from all eyes below the head@@ lights of the Olympic Games .
her overall result of 6@@ 2.@@ 198 was clearly before the Silver medal and &quot; Final Five &quot; -@@ Mann@@ y@@ amer@@ adin A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian Bron@@ zem@@ e@@ aw@@ winning Ali@@ ya Mu@@ st@@ af@@ ina .
&quot; the American Simone Bal@@ es tur@@ bine on the sister @-@ beam during the single occasion of women in the Olympic Winter Games in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ it is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual Americ@@ an@@ erin , which wins a multi @-@ campus and overall the fifth , while they soli@@ ds their reputation to be the most of its generation or even at all . &quot;
it broke out in tears when her end result was shown and her long journey found at this moment an end .
&quot; this success puts it in the same le@@ ague as unique athletes , like Michael P@@ helps who have brought their sports to new heights : &quot;
&quot; it has dominated the last three years of its sports , 15 World Championship medals - including 10 Gold medals - with so amazing exercises won that the Olympi@@ asi@@ tism of 1984 Mary Lou cle@@ on from her said that she &apos;s &quot; the best gymn@@ ast that I have ever seen . &quot;
&quot; there was expected to be a last test in Brazil , a competition which was not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a last over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be seen as disappointment . &quot;
&quot; the American Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace the left of gold and silver in the single @-@ section of women at the Olympic Winter 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday , won &quot;
&quot; Bal@@ es won the first medal on Tuesday , while it served at the far@@ ewell party which was reti@@ ring team co @-@ ordin@@ ator in Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a sign @-@ sign . &quot;
&quot; although Bil@@ ly insi@@ sted it , during their long track on the tip , never the future planned , this is not really true . &quot;
part of their v@@ ows - which contain their typical tum@@ bling pass - is tailored to the Latin American music which would fit at home outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is not a coinci@@ dence .
&quot; this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child , and from Train@@ ee A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother was discovered during a school@@ ing in the gym , in which Bo@@ or@@ man trained , was used to force . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2013 , she has no more competitive competition since the summer of 2013 , a winning series which will keep as long as it wishes . &quot;
&quot; even if Mu@@ st@@ af@@ ina led easy through two rot@@ ations , tr@@ aded the picture . &quot;
Schwe@@ be@@ bal@@ ken and Bo@@ ar@@ oos - in which Bil@@ es keeps the World Championship - lau@@ gh .
once again she resum@@ ed with 15,@@ 433 on the flo@@ at - and sat with a 15.@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground there is still one of it .
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ man re@@ im@@ pover@@ ished it soft to her du@@ der@@ og@@ ging - a pure form@@ ality - and tears , in Bil@@ a sh@@ iny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , when the vision they once were described in their collection @-@ book . &quot;
&quot; the achievement of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a reven@@ ge for the last time four years ago , when she went to the third place , but the bronze medals in a Ti@@ eb@@ r@@ ake went to Mu@@ st@@ af@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; this time the 22 @-@ year team @-@ members had called &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; &quot; created by the Americans &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; after their ground pressure they cast out to the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback that sometimes appeared . &quot;

police : 3 victims in series production when music is shot in the car
&quot; according to the police report , which were released on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl who have been shot in one of the k@@ ill@@ ful attacks since a decade in the first series of mass destruction of Phoenix while they stopped in the car and heard music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Rochelle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June , while the car was par@@ ked in an driv@@ eway , the authorities said . &quot;
the k@@ iller mo@@ red eight shots from a hand@@ mo@@ ist while he stood on the ho@@ ist side of the car and fled afterwards with another vehicle in the report .
&quot; the police declared that the thre@@ e@@ fold murder does not seem to be the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y , since the att@@ acker did not take care of the wr@@ ist or the $ 2,@@ 900 who took possession of one of the adult victims . &quot;
&quot; the Poli@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ cher by Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting the investig@@ ator has lost , a closer look at it , whether they are connected with four previous attacks . &quot;
&quot; altogether , predomin@@ antly in h@@ isp@@ anic resi@@ dences were killed in nine attacks in nine attacks , seven people killed and two others in@@ ju@@ red . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , told Howard of K@@ HP@@ O , an affiliate of CB@@ S , beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that the susp@@ ects has been used several vehicles , including a brown ri@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln . &quot;
the investig@@ ates refuse the evidence of proof that they have led to the conclusion that the attacks have been linked to the conclusion that the attacks have been linked to the same mur@@ derer .
&quot; El@@ lis , 33 , was hosp@@ it@@ alized because of its violations and died later . &quot;
&quot; liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site . &quot;
a witness told the police with that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listening to music .
&quot; the authorities also published a police report about the shooting , which was postpon@@ ed on an empty Pick@@ up truck , half an hour before the triple murder , and out of which it was the work of the series of series . &quot;
investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ age and super@@ vised a ball from the seat as well as ball frag@@ ments from the motor room .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro @-@ ephal@@ y : &quot; it is better &quot;
&quot; as most 6 @-@ year @-@ old Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ uto loves singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but as the least of his family enjoyed Ed@@ mund micro @-@ ephal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder , beyond which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ uto nothing knew during their pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; when he came home the first time , my first thought I did not create that . &quot;
I don &apos;t forget that .
I did not let myself be left .
&quot; what is not right at all -- of course one has left them , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; her husband Vincent and her was told that Ed@@ mund may never recognize them under circumstances , and that he may not even survive . &quot;
some doctors even went so far that they sm@@ ote it to institu@@ tion@@ alise it .
&quot; my first answer to it was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; explained Pic@@ ci@@ uto . &quot;
Ed@@ mund can be done with the help of a cabinet .
&quot; Ed@@ mund was not able to sit , neither to his third year nor do he still cannot speak . &quot;
but he slowly does progress .
it can run with support and cycling .
he also loves it with his two brothers to play and sing .
&quot; Elizabeth shows the drawing language , which has Ed@@ mund for &quot; Please sing me something &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bring him drawing language at &quot; , &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ uto CB@@ S News . &quot;
but it is not a typical drawing language -- she says . Ed@@ mund has inv@@ ented some signs alone .
micro ephal@@ y has a variety of causes : genetic as with Ed@@ mund as well as infections with viruses such as Mas@@ ers or the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect life with the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus inspir@@ ational .
Pic@@ ci@@ uto is rem@@ inded of the emotional price of an in@@ certain future .
&quot; I asked , what will happen ? &quot;
what will happen ?
and they do not know it still .
I have no longer asked for a long time after the progn@@ osis because I don &apos;t expect that someone can truly say to me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ uto has caused a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of inf@@ ants with birth damage caused by the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus .
it is better .
you know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .

an floo@@ ding system is used over large parts in the south of Louis@@ i@@ anas to Saturday .
the weather service left de@@ void that in this area could include additional 3 to 5 inches of rain .
&quot; in the south of Al@@ ab@@ amas , on Friday a floo@@ d@@ early system was used , while in the area Mobile continues to reg@@ ain . &quot;
&quot; the River Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the River Am@@ ite near D@@ enh@@ am Springs , which are both in Louis@@ iana , will all be likely to reach over the weekend records . &quot;
the Met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could floo@@ ded many houses in the mountains near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge floo@@ ds .

&quot; Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members would have all disabilities , and he would be the one who can swim . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that Not@@ hel@@ fer would have saved all three in a large military truck and had brought them to the next fire@@ side in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommo@@ dated until Friday . &quot;
&quot; Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the floo@@ ds had rapidly spread rapidly , as there was still severe rain accidents and that the authorities use evac@@ uation instructions . &quot;

the condition of the boy was classified as a critical ground in a hospital and he had to under@@ go several operations .
the family of the boys shared the transmitter with that he is expected again .
he would have to start the first class in a local school .
Brown was one of four individuals who were shot in Germ@@ ant@@ own .
&quot; also , three men were shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
one of the 29 @-@ year men in the critical state ; the other two victims are according to CB@@ S Philadelphia in a stable state .
&quot; the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , which is found in a critical state , reported the transmitter . &quot;
the other two victims were not found in the car and the police determined if one of the last men of the perpet@@ rators could be .
investig@@ ators shared CB@@ S Philadelphia with that it seems to be a cross @-@ fire between multiple arch@@ ers .
&quot; pat@@ ron@@ age for storm @-@ b@@ ehr@@ e , which were trac@@ ed to various ra@@ vines , sur@@ vey@@ ed the Tat@@ ort . &quot;
it seems that it is quite obvious to have a continuous struggle .
&quot; on the road , on both sides of the walking distance , found themselves H@@ ül@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; so it seems to have several armed fighters here , who were very active involved , told the police of the police of Gin@@ al@@ di of Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia . &quot;
several houses and vehicles were made in the area .
&quot; it came to no feast , and the police currently exam@@ ining reports according to the surveillance video . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , another 6 @-@ year girl was hit by a par@@ r@@ ack@@ et on the arm , when she played before her house in the residential neighborhood of the West Oak Lane . &quot;
she recovered and the police is still looking for a condem@@ nation .
why we Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I pre@@ ach me among the women &apos;s ol@@ ymp@@ ho@@ y in the tower and that of more than one reason .
&quot; first , I have never been so dominant since 1984 at every summer season and the US has never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; and secondly : this team has three turbines , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez who inspired many young girls of other skin colour . &quot;
&quot; the structure of these team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jewish J@@ ani , and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , the Cath@@ o@@ kin is , ab@@ round , makes every pride . &quot;
this team is finally reflected in the USA .
it has paved the black and h@@ isp@@ anic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one was one of the female gymn@@ asts .
last year were Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympi@@ ag@@ ew@@ inner and the Americas .
&quot; now the world was able to witness witness of the incredible performance of the three World Cup in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez as they had unexpected , but master@@ ful G@@ ym@@ atic routines . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Simone the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual Americans was won at an individual multi@@ campaign event for women gold . &quot;
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
&quot; we are experiencing the tip of this sport , but you will not see the turn@@ around in the whole country . &quot;
Simone The Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie sm@@ ote all the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to create it into the ol@@ ymp@@ ic team .
&quot; they are the &quot; &quot; last five &quot; , &quot; because the next Olympi@@ ad will only four gymn@@ ast in the crew . besides , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality looks like Tur@@ n a te@@ urer sport is and Tur@@ ner to be maintained primarily in private trainers who will be maintained by parents who come for training , travel , travel , and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their turbines and families ) . the list will continue to continue . &quot;
the majority of these trainers are in a weal@@ thy suburbs that can support the business .
&quot; in these verses , the gymn@@ asts are preserved its full training and that is for the families a expensive and long @-@ term commitment . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , Train@@ ers of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , Train@@ ers of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both have trained their athletes , since they started with the tur@@ fs . &quot;
&quot; we have to be inspired by the congreg@@ ations of countless , young girls , which are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , make a high @-@ day and easier accessible turn@@ around . &quot;
I was founded my turn@@ outs of 20 years .
&quot; with my events we have offered free and affordable tur@@ fs in Harlem for about 15,000 0,000 young people ( mainly black and h@@ isp@@ anic ) and trains national and international winners . &quot;
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth high quality tur@@ fs that deserve the opportunity to learn from this great ol@@ ymp@@ ic sport .
&quot; mixed strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination to the mind . &quot;
this combination offers li@@ fel@@ ong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success .
&quot; it is the inspiration of these crew , which are thousands of young girls to get interesting for the tower and that is great . &quot;
&quot; it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls . &quot;
this is an so exciting time .
&quot; thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ es of the Olympic team of golden and thanks , comp@@ ass her so many young girls with a different background to begin their way to begin healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
assistance experts would like to organise further strikes after they have rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal
&quot; the ministers had hosted the dispute over the changes through acceptance of a reform@@ ist agreement with the leaders of British Medical Association , but 58 per cent of the 37.@@ 000 assistant who voted against him in a election . &quot;
&quot; in July , hunt plans un@@ vei@@ led the treaty and said that the N@@ HS would be harmful in a &quot; &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; &quot; and any further delay for the employees and patients . &quot;
&quot; the first wiz@@ ards should receive a new contract to improve changes on bed@@ time and weekend , to improve the care of ast@@ o@@ ast movements . &quot;
&quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chair of the B@@ MA Com@@ peti@@ ees shared last night in a communication with : &quot; assistance leaders have led to the proposed contract for as much serious concerns , in particular that there will be the current ins@@ eg@@ ial crisis and administered it to treat all doctors . &quot;
&quot; in just eight weeks , who still remain , until the first group of doctors fall under the new treaty , must be made progress and the time is running out . &quot;
efforts by the B@@ MA for resol@@ ving disputes through talks during the government to engage in opposition and at times on de@@ af@@ ening silence .
&quot; this happened to that of a promise , Jerem@@ y Hunt only last month about it , that his door would always be open . &quot;
Jerem@@ y Hunt must now act to lift the pre@@ condition and address the concerns of the assistance .
&quot; if he should not do this , so it made the wiz@@ ards clearly made that they are ready to perform further work amp@@ hibi@@ tive measures . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a glo@@ ve of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine surgery and 100.000 times , since hospitals were de@@ es and specialists in order to give doctors on the stri@@ k@@ post office . &quot;
the ministers had hop@@ ed to end the dispute over the changes through an assumption of the reform@@ ist contract with the leaders of the British Medical Association .
the B@@ MA wants to create a better week@@ day for the 54.@@ 000 assist@@ ants that are subject to the contract .
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director @-@ Director of the N@@ HS employees , called the assistant to end the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; labour amp@@ hibi@@ tive measures reach nothing of only little , but already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patients , nurs@@ ing care and their families only worries , distress and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
&quot; over the past two months , we have spoken to the com@@ en@@ ee of the assistant director and with the Health Minister of Health and other mini@@ stries to respond positively to concerns about pre@@ mat@@ ernity and wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ low@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; the employers hop@@ ed that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , trainings , mutual recognition of the cur@@ riculum , continuing education of the cur@@ riculum , continuing education of the cur@@ riculum , continuing education of England and the Ministry of Health concerning the observ@@ ance of agreements with the B@@ MA in November , February and May . &quot;
the £ 2 @-@ per Tag@@ - drug which can reduce heart attack
thousands of heart attack patients are benef@@ ited from a £ 2 @-@ per day drug after being advised by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the framed medication T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of re@@ peti@@ tive heart attack for people with a her@@ edit@@ ary disease .
&quot; the drug is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , causing the risk of stroke if or another heart of heart . &quot;
the regul@@ ators nice of the N@@ HS has recommended for four years long intake to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the regul@@ ators nice of the N@@ HS has recommended for four years long intake to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; some 140,000 people suffer from a heart attack and a quarter of it suffer from another heart attack , or stroke . &quot;
&quot; heart attack and stroke cases are caused by accumulation of fatty material in the arter@@ ies , the flo@@ or@@ saw form . &quot;
&quot; if the Bel@@ ag apart breaks , it can cause a blood stream from blood flow to the heart and thus causing a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; if the blood falls , it can flow through the blood flow and flow of blood flow to the brain , which causes a stroke . &quot;
individuals who had already had a heart attack subject to a higher risk to another risk .
&quot; T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca , and under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que is driven , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cells un@@ prob@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the guide &apos;s throw from nice , which today was released , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , director of the nice health insurance policy , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons who suffered a heart attack , another heart attack or stroke - often with dis@@ astro@@ us consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have substantial negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in effective in reducing other heart attack and stroke cases in people who had already had a heart attack .
&quot; through a pro@@ visional recommendation of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to extend the treatment options to thousands of people that benefit from it . &quot;
&quot; the information on the effic@@ acy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - above all the blood risk , is limited to a period of up to three years . it does not recommend treatment that goes beyond that time period . &quot;
culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ ital can be tor@@ n in Muslim areas
the former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man last year on the re@@ sign@@ ation of a government report due to corruption from office
a culture of the Political Cor@@ rec@@ ano has led that wide choice of election in Muslim communities would be ignored as a crus@@ hing government report today .
&quot; the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es acc@@ esses the police , elect@@ oral and no@@ thous@@ es to do it , proo@@ fs of elect@@ oral abuse on due to &quot; over@@ sensitivity &quot; for Eth@@ nie and Religion &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former Minister of Integration and Commun@@ al Government , who is now an antagon@@ ism from religious motives so bad , that it should be allowed to protect the police outside of elect@@ oral bodies to protect against intim@@ id@@ ated voters . &quot;
recommends that voters should lead a de@@ jo@@ vice with themselves to prove their identity in elections .
currently there must be a voters just his name and address .
&quot; the report suggests that not removable ink on the finger of a person , when they give their choice to prevent that someone choos@@ es twice . &quot;
wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers should receive more protection from Sir Eric .
he calls that the press should have more access to communities and decisions made by no official comm@@ ent@@ ees or work@@ groups .
&quot; this is not only used against elect@@ oral fraud , but also aims to protect the communist government in front of the wider corruption and financial fraud that goes with it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was arranged by the Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets elect@@ oral Soci@@ eties in the East of London .
&quot; last year , a special elect@@ oral court decided that the official Mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man after a L@@ itan@@ ei in corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry . &quot;
&quot; the court was that Rah@@ man would have conquered the religious feelings of his Muslim community , &quot; and &quot; that he had brought his critics with r@@ attle , and Islam@@ op@@ host@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; Rah@@ man is supposed to have led his campaign on the basis that it is the reli@@ ance of Muslims from Muslims , to choose him . &quot;
&quot; up to 300 votes were either ques@@ tioned or the result of a im@@ itation , when someone choos@@ es one person as someone else . &quot;
Sir Eric said that there would be evidence of fraud across the land .
he expressed particularly al@@ ar@@ ming for the frau@@ dul@@ ent letter - with the older members of the Muslim community pressure on people who had made a candidate of their choice .
&quot; Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to conf@@ use the voting system , including the guide from out to prove the identity &quot;
&quot; in his report , it says : &quot; as proof was attached that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exer@@ ted , especially women and young people , in order to vote in accordance with the will of the elders , particularly communities with Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ics or bank@@ rupt background . &quot;
&quot; there was concerns that ... state institutions have such a behaviour due to &quot; politically correct &quot; over@@ sensitivity regarding Eth@@ nie and religion ignored . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to form the system , including prohibition that political activi@@ sts are subject to work on &quot; &quot; re@@ harvest &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , also calls for harder registration tests to prevent that the choice of choice is used to Im@@ mig@@ r@@ ation and social @-@ bed purposes . &quot;
take into account voters in front of the election according to your credit card .
&quot; not removable ink on the finger of a person , as soon as they released their voice to prevent that someone choos@@ es twice . &quot;
systematic review on the nationality of a person to ensure that they are either eligible .
a three @-@ year limit for applications on an automatic stamp @-@ selection .
ban that political activ@@ ist complete brief@@ sel@@ ections and envel@@ opes of letter .
the police give authority to put down to the stations .
&quot; a legislative change , which facilit@@ ates an indic@@ t@@ ment for intim@@ i@@ dation in accordance with the representation of the People Act 1983 ( Pop@@ ular Act 1983 ) . &quot;
photographers offered in the multi @-@ gy@@ ms .
requirement that only English in the work@@ stations may be used ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that the employees tend to en@@ force their voters alone into the elect@@ oral cabin .
Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &apos; amaz@@ ingly &apos; that after the Tower of Ham@@ lets case there was no penalty display .
&quot; the elect@@ oral court has Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his representative for the corrupt against corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ changing , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he was not guilty for a number of reasons for a number of reasons , according to the high demands in criminal procedures . &quot;
he also cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed the effective &quot; ab@@ sten@@ tions &quot; of the constitu@@ encies of the Rath@@ äuser .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court @-@ part in Tower of Ham@@ lets from last year was a War@@ n@@ signal .
&quot; our country carries a proud heritage as the mother of parliam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and covered spread of elect@@ oral and ligh@@ tening of some authorities threat@@ ening this good reputation . &quot;
lo@@ opy to K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Double predecessor and other famous double @-@ ans from Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ ers in Rio
fans of the Olympi@@ ad 2016 in Rio are this week about the French Rad@@ sport Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot out of edge and band that proved to be an impressive double bedroom in the heart of Cambridge .
&quot; but the 24 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ ion@@ ik@@ in is by far not the only to stop gold fighting ath@@ l@@ ete , who has its own famous double @-@ ers - at least not , if you have the social media belief . &quot;
&quot; to honor the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that fle@@ ers at the time on our screens , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a lists of Olympic Games that have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Dutch leg@@ gy . &quot;
&quot; the h@@ unters and the Wolf : team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Br@@ ady El@@ l@@ ison , left , is compared since his childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio &quot;
&quot; except K@@ ates Double predecessor in the ra@@ dar track , many people on the internet turn out like a certain ar@@ cher of the T@@ illing of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio . &quot;
&quot; the team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Br@@ ady El@@ l@@ ison has caused a crash on Twitter , after pictures , on which he sees the Wolf of Wall Street Star un@@ secre@@ tly similar . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the ar@@ cher received the mad@@ ness in social media with and gave to hear that he has already been hearing since his childhood he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I do not see any great simil@@ arity with the exception of the facial hair , told Br@@ ady of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a ben@@ ign guy , so I hate the probably as ac@@ compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly compete more in the centre : the enligh@@ tening simil@@ arity between the British Weit@@ spr@@ inger Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
the Russian Tur@@ ner@@ in Ali@@ ya Mu@@ st@@ af@@ ina with its large , expres@@ sive eyes should go through a double bedroom for the Cub@@ an American singer in Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an . &quot;
and in the swimming pool the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has compared with the G@@ lee Star Matthew Mor@@ rison .
&quot; a course higher : this user is the view that Nathan is the &quot; Ath@@ le@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption Schauspiel@@ ers &quot;
a further late comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Na@@ dal and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett who has similarly heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
&quot; the Russian Silver medal in Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova points out more than just the sun @-@ coloured skin and bl@@ on@@ den ha@@ irs as the actress Ann@@ al@@ yn@@ ne Mc@@ Cor@@ d , while the American Nathan has been replaced by Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
&quot; strong women : foot@@ star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter actress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar facial shape and eyes &quot;
not the only one : a Twitter User was very happy that any other simil@@ arities are also fallen apart
theory put in the room : according to this user there is a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple perhaps a reason
&quot; a Twitter User@@ in declared their satisfaction , that &quot; the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter nearly identical . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the US @-@ foot@@ star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter actress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter an incredibly similar facial shape and eyes . &quot;
&quot; other popular Ver@@ sions Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical with the actress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal in Tur@@ n Gab@@ by Douglas , which resem@@ bles its own beautiful , wide smile that resem@@ bles the Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union . &quot;

the commentary ator Byron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone will be switched off when he sh@@ iel@@ ded its own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m .
&quot; Mac@@ don@@ ald , who had been picked up in the CB@@ S on board to give more &apos; color &apos; , you could hear : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the union , baby . &quot;

&quot; the criticism against Byron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came fast and hard , with whom many were given to speech &quot;
Twitter users didn &apos;t hold back as they listened to how uns@@ ensi@@ bly Byron Mac@@ Donald was
&quot; another Twitter User@@ in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; Wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald . &quot;

we spent yesterday night quickly with our spect@@ ators on shipment and our follow @-@ up in social media .
&quot; to make a clear , Byr@@ ne comments related to the performance of s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , they were un@@ reasonable and an un@@ happy chosen formulation . Byron is doing what he said , very sorry . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ Donald in the show and tried to justify his remarks by saying that it was not his intention that it is designed as a personal attack . &quot;
&quot; I would like to take a moment for a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment , which I made after women &apos;s swimming pool in the C@@ BC Olympi@@ as he said . &quot;
&quot; I took me on the performance of s@@ wimm@@ ers , and not on them as a person . &quot;

how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a before arms
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make him a bit safer for you . &quot;
&quot; we talked with Rh@@ on Miz@@ rach@@ i , a Grand Master of Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Ver@@ ban@@ des in New York to find out how to walk with armed rob@@ bers . &quot;
regardless of whether you are se@@ ated from the front or from the back , this video will show you how to rot@@ ate for your inc@@ ense . &quot;
&quot; if one should withdraw from the rear , then you should be able to turn to the first so that you can see your att@@ acker , and move out of the Chat@@ eau , &quot; says Miz@@ rach@@ i . &quot;
grab the weapon then between your fore@@ arm and your shoulder before you hit him with your free el@@ bow .
&quot; then strike it with the knee into the corp@@ ses and twi@@ sted , while the att@@ acker is assembled before pain@@ s , take the weapon from his hands . strike it with the run into the face and move back , while they set the weapon upon him . &quot;
&quot; at att@@ ackers that approach from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the line , grab the weapon and turn it , so that the att@@ acker can not shoot . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , store the weight on the gun and beat the att@@ acker to the chest , then turn the gun from his handle before they move back@@ wards and set the weapon upon him . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it is Miz@@ rach@@ i Vor@@ rach@@ i .
&quot; but remember that it is at a rob@@ ber@@ y at the safest , your money is to over@@ pass , if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master . &quot;

&quot; the thought , distr@@ action the dish@@ on@@ head of a draw toil@@ ette , which was already used by thousands of others , may seem totally ab@@ rup@@ ture , but actually are in a kitchen fl@@ ush more poor bacteria . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right with doctors and medical specialists about the promotion of gut bacteria and his own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , nothing left what he read , more than a bad night taste in the mouth . &quot;
&quot; Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resi@@ li@@ ence of his intest@@ ine by having traveled through the world , and peculi@@ ar things as well as wonderful things . &quot;
&quot; from public funds to train stations up to the sin@@ ks of toilets , the task presented his immune system definitely under a sample &quot;
&quot; he told me : &quot; as a child , I was relatively un@@ worried about what my health concerns and I put all kinds of things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and mud . &quot;
in the film he was able to meet his reputation in any case .
&quot; the only thing he wanted , was a dirty public toilet in Russia . &quot;
his Pro@@ b@@ sp@@ lash showed a l@@ om@@ eters of more than 4000 units .
&quot; compared to this , the l@@ om@@ eters number is fresh@@ ly weigh@@ ted hands less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet , which he ref@@ used to ref@@ used , after their lo@@ ot@@ om@@ eters over 4000 units was , while fresh@@ ly washed hands from less than 60 &quot;
Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the guide &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength &quot; which shows the bacterial number of different places like the bathroom
&quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; this comes to the worst , which I have bot@@ her@@ ed in a toilet . &quot;
there is nothing dirt than that !
&quot; I am here nothing an@@ ew , because it is here indo@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products vali@@ dating .
&quot; the company is looking for Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us , which contains both the anth@@ ra@@ inf@@ used as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of gut bacteria and the immune system . &quot;
&quot; vali@@ os Senior Venice President for Snacks , ju@@ ices and new categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer the consumer something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at the same time and explains the benefits of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
&quot; we led crazy Bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings through which we end@@ owed , that we said &quot; &quot; L@@ ass us Ian . &quot; &quot;
they claim that the interest in intest@@ inal health is becoming a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of intest@@ inal health and how it is linked to the immune system . &quot;
the growing interest in the intest@@ inal health is a global phenomenon and with documentary film we could provide the consumer more information in an interesting way .
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who introduced the director of the film , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have put my respect for Ian , when he would have arous@@ ed my respect for Ian , when he wanted to rely him to l@@ ure , just like the ek@@ el@@ ective Russian toilet , which is shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course there were things where it was easier to bring Ian to them , they d@@ anced and others , with which this was quite difficult . &quot;
&quot; I am glad , that we have recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film . &quot;
&quot; in one of vali@@ dating the survey conducted in 2015 by 2015 associ@@ ated 84 per cent of all the in@@ quired of dairy farmers in particular with the well being of gast@@ ro and intest@@ ine and 58 percent said that they are at least occasionally use products that included . &quot;
&quot; A@@ social family destroyed prior to Del@@ o@@ gi@@ sion soci@@ ologist in Sal@@ t@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; a as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family left her social appearance after a del@@ usion with a damage to the amount of £ 5@@ 0,000 because she had terr@@ ised her neighbours . &quot;
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ aun Tre@@ bil@@ cock were cast after a long list of complaints from their property in Sal@@ t@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; after they have been rolled out of their property , we were sho@@ cked the housing estate property in an irre@@ par@@ able state . &quot;
&quot; the walls were gro@@ unded holes on , wooden di@@ ps have been mounted on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubric@@ ated to the walls . &quot;
the family were sanc@@ tified and it is believed that they now lives in private accommodation
&quot; Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ oy who works for the company management of Corn@@ wall , said that they fear@@ ed that the apartment can no longer be repaired . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; It was an absolute nigh@@ tm@@ are and I am the view that people do not have to live in this way . &quot;
there are many things to consider since this property is probably regarded as not as beautiful part Corn@@ walls .
the family is not@@ ori@@ ous and their reputation is also .
&quot; the pair had three sons , who lived in the apartment and the police said that terror that the family had added , en@@ du@@ mping of residents , drug abuse , drug , and excessive cry , streams and flu@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was made in the lease , got an arrangement for anti@@ social behavior in June . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which may be demol@@ ished under circumstances , old gar@@ bage found &quot;
they were tr@@ aded in the property where drugs were tr@@ aded in the past .
neighbours told that they had to fight them on the street and regularly had to inv@@ oked the police
Corn@@ wall Housing Dr@@ del@@ o@@ gi@@ ed her and her partner this week is for@@ ci@@ ful by the property after they extended them an extended period of 11 weeks to commit voluntarily .
&quot; Del@@ o@@ gi@@ fication were pra@@ ised by ligh@@ tened neighbors , who said their lives to hell . &quot;
&quot; one said , &quot; &quot; she sh@@ ou@@ ted to anyone . &quot;
we lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad .
&quot; the countless times we say the police here , are incredible . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; today tomorrow we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood on because it was so quiet here - we are not usual !
&quot; now , where they are finally gone , it will be nice . &quot;
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall Housing said that it had administered the family with the local authorities .
&quot; the family lived in the house , to which the police was called in regular intervals , 20 years &quot;
on the ski@@ pped side of the municipal house were cast and old toys .
&quot; he added : &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant dre@@ amed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and the family as a del@@ usion always the last step , the Corn@@ wall Housing is always considered . &quot;
this was a very difficult case because the behavior was extremely difficult and their actions had to be horri@@ ble for their neighbours .
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community who have come to us and have made us the information to have done . &quot;
I hope that this development of some neighbors will sp@@ ends and the message is not toler@@ ated that anti @-@ social behavior is not toler@@ ated .
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but they all have been over 20 . &quot;
a narrow mattress located in one of the bedrooms of the house after Del@@ o@@ gi@@ val on the ground .
&quot; workers of the house management are now to be gar@@ bage , which is surrounded by the house . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g of cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ os and cash in height of £ 1.@@ 700 . &quot;
Skel@@ don received a fine effect after making it guilty of the possession of a drug of class B in trade agreements .
&quot; they said that the money for a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee Skel@@ don is , who was in 2013 a car accident . &quot;
&quot; after they were without shelter , T@@ anya and their partner are now living in private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many ro@@ om@@ ances of the house were treated with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says that she ten@@ ants to take care of the or@@ atory .
&quot; Angela C@@ row distributed by the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , that Del@@ o@@ gi@@ val was a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants that do not believe in order . &quot;
&quot; this goes to those who may think that they can accept itself without a su@@ icide , as well as those who have been damaged by such a behaviour . &quot;
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never toler@@ ate criminal and anti @-@ social behavior that continue to work with partners to protect our communities .

then I returned to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to Press@@ views , the party Tru@@ mp are forced to submit money to support his election campaign , he should not present any better circulation values . &quot;

the exile said that the federal government has positioned itself as sharp as Austria against Erd@@ og@@ an and its adher@@ ents .
also in Germany find a &quot; wit@@ ting hunt &quot; against Erd@@ og@@ an @-@ critics .
I do not feel safe in Germany for the first time in recent months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement is also fear@@ ed the escape of many Turks .
&quot; more Turks will look for asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and opposition . &quot;
the Brand@@ y Brand@@ y as a Gü@@ len tr@@ ailers of teachers and other academ@@ ics are the professional existence .
&quot; who does not adapt and Erd@@ og@@ an , is sitting on packed caffeine , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and sec@@ ular , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the newspaper among calling on figures from the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the Turks presented the Turks already before Putin &apos;s largest group of because of political persecution recognised asylum in Germany . &quot;
&quot; on the occasion of 30 June , these 11.@@ 386 people and therefore almost 29 percent of all over the asylum entitled to be eligible ( 39.@@ 625 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this survey , do not find the war , poverty or perspective . &quot;
&quot; asylum seek@@ ers in accordance with the Basic Law is only politically , therefore , of state @-@ law , individually persec@@ uted . &quot;
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; to go there where it w@@ eh@@ eth .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals get nothing from the summer campaign with - and the ho@@ liday@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ West@@ phal@@ ia not allowed to choose land @-@ day .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they have understood .
&quot; 2021 will not take place during the summer holidays again at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; for so far , it does not go : summer holidays , heat and country @-@ day battle - that is attached . &quot;
&quot; locals , who are to be convinced by the choice of choice , are on holiday . &quot;
&quot; the all @-@ all vac@@ ation@@ ers that are located in the country , on Us@@ edom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not locals , so may not choose land @-@ day . &quot;
&quot; these are practical problems : in the holidays are hel@@ pers , the posters will inc@@ ur , bal@@ lo@@ ons , flyer and count towards the end of votes only m@@ üh@@ ev@@ oll . &quot;
&quot; up to 4 September 2016 , the elect@@ oral and last Fer@@ i@@ ent@@ ag , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern must take place shortly after the people over themselves . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear its office . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , since 1998 strongest party , is now in surveys clear behind the CD@@ U . &quot;
&quot; exciting , how strongly new@@ com@@ ing Af@@ D is cut , and what remains at the end of the end of a coalition . &quot;
&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 ruling p@@ ef , makes an almost in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous elect@@ oral campaign , one sees from his grand@@ children . &quot;
&quot; he travels through the land , distri@@ butes ro@@ ses and pl@@ au@@ ding a little with the people , just as it was already his legendary place Harald Ring@@ storff . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , past@@ ering can get cold feet and gives ch@@ anc@@ ellor Merkel the gu@@ ilt of the Af@@ D . &quot;
&quot; their refuge@@ e policy , you &quot; &quot; We create that &quot; &quot; have accelerated the rise of justi@@ fication , which will probably cost the beautiful office now . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U with its Spitz@@ enk@@ andi@@ b data , the Interior Lorenz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced as it is when you do at the wrong time at the right place of choice . &quot;
she has invited twice a ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel to large @-@ known German Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s Bundestag in the north @-@ east .
&quot; but the target group did not vote , there were more North Rhine @-@ West@@ phal@@ ia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg @-@ Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority of other Länder , &quot; lod@@ ged Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot;
&quot; but it does not have to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel . &quot;
otherwise we wai@@ ves the Nord@@ ust @-@ CD@@ U largely to the usual choice of options on market@@ places and before shopping centers with umbrellas and bal@@ lo@@ ons .
&quot; this , so that Kok@@ ert does not play a &quot; &quot; minor role . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; also the Union has noticed that you are at the land the base cru@@ m@@ ble , that it must be very ri@@ gor@@ ous to find a wire to the people again . &quot;
&quot; you do not see it like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : in the sides of the country barely exist . &quot;
&quot; the Council of the CD@@ U elect@@ oral campaigns against his fellow @-@ stre@@ ite is also self @-@ puri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; you must go there , namely where people are : Dor@@ l , Golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
&quot; because much on the game , Sell@@ ering has now called his SPD to a particularly dedicated elect@@ oral campaign . &quot;
&quot; in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats ap@@ ologi@@ ze at 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just below the Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the election of 2011 , the SPD had yet been made clear with 35.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Gre@@ ens , minor party with seven percent in the surveys , are likely to create the jump in the country . &quot;
they do not make a modern virtu@@ e out of the holidays in need of a modern virtu@@ e and put their campaigns in the internet .
&quot; online election &quot; , &quot; called the provincial Claudia Müller . &quot;
otherwise the green elect@@ oral campaigns on c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship to local stim@@ uli are happy to be found among the tourists .
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ jek , the sh@@ enk@@ andi@@ da@@ tin , kur@@ t just with a boat @-@ boat through the m@@ ec@@ kl@@ en@@ burg@@ se lakes and find it even beautiful . &quot;
&quot; your impression of &quot; &quot; voting in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 rehabilitation : private plants suffer from blocking
&quot; in the speed , with which the B 27 is maintained , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; for those responsible for the building work , which begin at 5.@@ 30 am and only at 8 pm , there are all praise . &quot;
&quot; they have done everything pretty much , told El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff by the jet gas station . &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is no de@@ duction .
&quot; the construction site could be scheduled at weekends as a half @-@ beginning , until the end of October should be done everything . &quot;
&quot; Pro@@ mis@@ t shall also be pra@@ ised the object of those responsible for construction work , about when it comes to setting up expe@@ ditions . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site on Monday to south , and also the block@@ age of the asphalt road in O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen has been removed and thus the connection to Rot@@ tenburg is back , the traffic situation within the place is relaxed . &quot;
the citizens can now run from O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen from the B 27 again .
the transportation through the place seems to be returned .
&quot; there were partially considerable ail@@ ments , &quot; says the chief management of the re@@ mun@@ eration management of the chief executive director Florian King . &quot;
&quot; the residents of Bas@@ har , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many sh@@ ines sought and rather their Nav@@ i confidential than the sign@@ age . &quot;
what led to that maneu@@ ver l@@ oth@@ es in residential areas .
&quot; since the speed of speed rati@@ ves have not been respected , the church will strongly enhance the vehicle from M@@ ös@@ sing . &quot;
&quot; there was significant transi@@ tions , &quot; says King , who made himself a situation on the spot . &quot;
already two to three per minute have been engra@@ ved .
the quick@@ est was travelling with 77 km @-@ kilomet@@ re in the temp@@ o @-@ 30 @-@ zone .
&quot; since the construction site is moved , but it became more quiet . &quot;
for busin@@ ess@@ men at the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ tenburg now the road is open again .
busin@@ ess@@ men don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
&quot; but that the B 27 refurb@@ ishment has led to them for sales up in sales , each one you might ask . &quot;
&quot; however , some are more and some less affected . &quot;
&quot; who has no less to do with the &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; , &quot; so for other companies , for which the reconstruction has hardly any consequences . &quot;
&quot; also at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Ma@@ ier speaks Thomas Sul@@ z from a &quot; &quot; most light drop &quot; , &quot; but also a that naturally &quot; the hard@@ est is missing . &quot;
the strongest is the Local along the road .
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öhn@@ er , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , former crown , finds distinct words . &quot;
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; not only him , but all the restaurants have hit it hard . &quot;
&quot; it was missing the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil . &quot;
we have to be glad to be pleased about each Euro turnover .
&quot; the turnover bu@@ ckl@@ ing rose to &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road @-@ licens@@ ing have returned its operation by two years .
half of his staff have to release them .
&quot; if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dism@@ is@@ sed , the policy re@@ acted differently . &quot;
&quot; instead , government President Jörg Schmidt has on a request made by G@@ öhn@@ er , whether there might be a financial compensation otherwise , with the indication , the guest house also benefit from the advantages of the location on the B 27 . now they also have the dis@@ advantages that carry out through the restoration . &quot;
&quot; Mr G@@ öhn@@ er knows from other land@@ circles , where such a bit has been gr@@ aded . &quot;
&quot; in all cases , G@@ öhn@@ er is sure that his guest house will continue . &quot;
&quot; after all , the family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , he refers to the long history . &quot;
&quot; that other so@@ jour@@ ne@@ ars now pay less frequently because of the complicated traffic light , it is possible to understand . &quot;
&quot; if one can not go , it is also something different . &quot;
that its stem cell came back after the end of the san@@ itation work back then G@@ öhn@@ er has no doubts .
&quot; despite the crises with B@@ SE and bir@@ d@@ oll , G@@ öhn@@ er holds the effects of B 27 @-@ construction at his clients for the greatest crisis which has experienced its hospitality in its long history . &quot;
six months construction work that is already brutal .
constantly on behalf of the terrorist fight against laws .
&quot; after the recent attacks , Interior de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is now a di@@ ck@@ able security package . &quot;
but what does a risk status should do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say about all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the Com@@ promis@@ ers .
&quot; all his proposals were politically reasonable , &quot; politically reasonable , &quot; says the Federal Minister of Minister of his new Security Council . &quot;
they are demanding anyone .
&quot; others , further points would initially be discussed within the parties . &quot;
also because of it &apos;s participation I myself .
&quot; but as an internal minister , he would be part of the results and an &quot; &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; within the Coalition . &quot;
&quot; after recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , he has sent a little time after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach before it presents its conclusions to security in the Republic . &quot;
but the fall for this is now the more extensive .
&quot; some is already known to announce that a new security authority is supposed to take care of the b@@ aking communication , is not new . &quot;
also not the fact that Germany must apply several EU requirements to flight data and ce@@ ase@@ fire .
the call for more video surveillance and staff for the security authorities comes as well as surprising .
&quot; at the part starts de Ma@@ izi@@ ère a second gear for suggestions , who present with the SPD so far , he wants sympath@@ iz@@ ers for terr@@ ors under punishment , and ji@@ ha@@ dist@@ s with double citizenship , with double citizenship of the German passport . &quot;
&quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; Sp@@ are the CD@@ U @-@ man . &quot;
&quot; however , he still consider this for reasonable and challenging even nothing , which does not have any chances in the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ partner . &quot;
a few new ideas presents de Ma@@ izi@@ ère .
they are partly in himself : he plans quick @-@ process for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for adher@@ ing to men prior to deport@@ ation .
&quot; refugees who are targeted towards the country , should previously release their smartphones and disclose social @-@ media accounts for a security @-@ check . &quot;
&quot; in case of acc@@ eding asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some worse than so far - about those who commit stra@@ igh@@ ates or consciously throw their identity in order to hide their identity . &quot;
some of these is politically and legally un@@ cle .
man@@ ches also works un@@ balanced and leaves questions open .
and with some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of Ged@@ il@@ dered for example - is the question : what does this actually have to do with safety and terror ?
&quot; yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ere , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the issues of refugees and terror . &quot;
but it cannot be said that the attacks were of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg refugees .
many people have also worried about the high refuge@@ e concern for safety .
&quot; and things that people have deeply involved , let &apos;s not let go out in the election times . &quot;
the inner security is enormous in the focus .
&quot; only the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the contam@@ ination is great .
&quot; and yes , there are elect@@ oral struggles . &quot;
Union and SPD are therefore increasingly dependent on the subject of internal security .
in the past few days there was a high level between the two parties .
&quot; only a gar@@ den@@ er dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons interior , in which the resort is also a Bur@@ ka ban and a return from the double citizenship . &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ere is also here to reconc@@ iled shades .
from a turn of the double pass he kept nothing .
we have not yet for@@ ged the discussion in Germany .
&quot; they are new to make , be not useful . &quot;
and at a Bur@@ ka prohibition he has constitutional concerns .
whether its own package is constitutional at all corners and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the co@@ ali@@ er partner .
there is something dr@@ in what could provide arguments .
&quot; however , the SPD is also trying to pro@@ long at the issue of internal security . &quot;
&quot; Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ alizes only times a careful talk and says , &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to the safety . &quot;
yet Volkswagen gli@@ ental through .
despite diesel @-@ sk@@ and@@ als rise worldwide .
but not in all markets it runs .
in the back campaign there is a concept .
Volkswagen starts with the deliveries of deliveries to the second half of the year .
&quot; in the course of Europe , the biggest car of Europe can continue to show a plus in the past year , despite its many brands and some well @-@ running markets further . &quot;
&quot; but in July weak@@ ened the kernel brand VW mainly in Western Europe , and thus lo@@ adable up again the total sales , such as that in the D@@ ax not@@ ched companies . &quot;
&quot; selling the brand VW in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars , 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the prior @-@ year period . &quot;
&quot; in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales and sales are 14 percent below the previous year . &quot;
in the home market Germany s@@ ack@@ ten the deliveries around almost a hex@@ ag@@ ons .
&quot; brand name Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann conducted the weaker figures from July , especially on two sales days less in Europe . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it has given a changing economic framework in some core markets . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey also called the British V@@ ot@@ um to leave the EU , a sp@@ okes@@ man explained . &quot;
&quot; in the USA , where the gas aff@@ inity first escal@@ ates , is also further a minus . &quot;
large support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; altogether , the mainly affected Hau@@ smar@@ ks of Lower Saxony is moving further gli@@ ding by the diesel @-@ scan@@ dal : after the first seven months , only a supply of 0,@@ 9 percent to be@@ ech has to be@@ ech . &quot;
consolidated tri@@ pe Fred Kap@@ pler was able to show a sales tool from January to July .
1.3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen at this time around 5,@@ 904 million .
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated with a software subscription .
&quot; in Germany alone , VW some 2.5 million cars are calling for retro@@ fit into the workshops . &quot;
in the course of conversion VW that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects .
&quot; after conversion of the vehicles , it does not give any deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor@@ power . &quot;
&quot; the bus point of the customer according to the retro@@ fitting a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate &quot; , &quot; but I do not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was on Friday in the company . &quot;
reason are legal int@@ ric@@ acies .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; had been reported , Volkswagen granted his German customers now a guarantee for inver@@ ted diesel @-@ models . &quot;
this was confirmed by the last Monday VW @-@ representative in the Federal Ministry of Transport .
the Ministry of Transport has been confirmed that this meeting was announced .
&quot; VW has the conditions of my investigation commission and the KBA fully fulfilled . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations of these are not accepted , &quot; stated Bundes@@ liga ster Alexander Dobr@@ ind@@ t ( C@@ SU ) according to the ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has taken over the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor@@ power according to the change@@ over no deteri@@ or@@ ations take place and have left all typical processing relevant vehicle values . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; but not as it was in business travel . &quot;
&quot; in the long term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; provides Volkswagen the possibility that customers for example are a half year after conversion into a workshop - and that could lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do . &quot;
&quot; in the customer &apos;s interest , it is important to avoid that there is any other damage caused by any other damage that comes with respect to any possible warranty conditions , as it was . &quot;
&quot; therefore , VW does not use the term &quot; guarantee &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands sufficient savings for the future death penalty - as a second Institute in Germany .
&quot; Josef Paul said on Thursday , &quot; &quot; it is only about 139 customers , which 40 million euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or day @-@ monetary policy . &quot;
&quot; the German Association German Banks speaks of a single case and does not see a signal : normal austerity would have to fear , to pay for their as@@ parag@@ us pen@@ al code . &quot;
&quot; camps banks cash on night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay her 0.20 percent pen@@ al code . &quot;
&quot; this fee requires the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate clients for deposits over 100,000 euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or day @-@ monetary policy . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 Euro are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 costs will cost € 400 in the year , &quot; said Paul . &quot;
&quot; he has been 40 million Euros that could be lifted from one day to the other , and which he could not be wast@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; these lie with me on the bank account and cause 0.4 percent cost , &quot; said the bank &apos;s boss . &quot;
&quot; I cannot lie for any million 4000 euros . &quot;
the costs may be given after the exp@@ urs@@ on principle .
&quot; the cash just lie in the saf@@ ari of the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank , would be much too dangerous : &quot; I have already experienced four transi@@ tions , I am not yet the fifth ! &quot; , &quot; said the ban@@ quet . &quot;
most of the customers have had understanding and altern@@ ating on other an@@ age@@ forms .
only few emig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; the cooperative association of Bavaria stated : &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB will cause significant costs in all banks . &quot;
&quot; you want to bear in alone , be &quot; economical permanently not possible . &quot;
&quot; some German banks therefore have increased their fees for con@@ duction , credit cards or transfers . &quot;
with criminal cases for deposits made from three million euros the Thurin@@ gi@@ an popul@@ ist and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank Al@@ ten@@ burger Land made head@@ lines with their Skat@@ bank @-@ Fili@@ ale 2014 head@@ lines .
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , main business leaders of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t expect that private clients have to pay for deposits , the competition in Germany is under banks and savings banks much too strong . &quot;
&quot; a ban@@ ker said , at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; a cliff , which is equipped from the assets . &quot;
&quot; this can be a problem for a small bank , if they have free money . &quot;
&quot; the 1911 , founded in 1911 , G@@ mund has two branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; in the region , known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs . &quot;
&quot; the cooperative association of Bavaria , currently no other banks are known , which calculate an en@@ cap@@ tion for deposits of private clients , &quot; said Mr. Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the President of the Federal Association of German People banks and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ banks ( BvR ) , Uwe joyful , had in late June : &quot; the threshold to go to neg@@ atives in opposite the private customer , is very , very high . &quot;
&quot; competition was tough , and it dro@@ ught the emig@@ ration from investors to the competition . &quot;
customers in Germany will not be able to do this in width .
destination plates : who purchases actually sound @-@ plates ?
lonely men medium age love plates .
&quot; before you made the comm@@ ent@@ ment , to over@@ take him under the pseu@@ don@@ ym non @-@ terrestrial man &apos;s age with r@@ ust ins@@ ults , this statement leads to current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v is the most frequent re@@ formation of sound panels not to see a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als , who want to welcome the re@@ alism of physical objects but to Mid@@ life @-@ nostal@@ gia . &quot;
those who have recently bought a record are all fore@@ sight according to the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely buyers .
&quot; it is also not a hor@@ des through hobby collectors &quot; - it has an emotional meaning : older plate , retain their feelings rather for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it to spend their own time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) . &quot;
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
&quot; if this blog would be a news report on TV , I would follow the camera while in the midst of a busy road in Soho , a hum@@ ble flo@@ wer@@ age and wild stu@@ d , before I ste@@ al my hands and tell something about it , &quot; so , let us take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let us take a look at it .
&quot; even though the heart of So@@ hos slowly turns out to his charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent seller have been based , there is still a handful of fantastic turn@@ tables . &quot;
I would probably ask the camera to turn the camera to the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to assess their age and mixtures through observation .
&quot; Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , whom I was aged by Si@@ ster Ray ( Dat@@ es : two young women , three men aged men ) into the Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data number : eight men aged men , a woman , pres@@ um@@ ably about the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the business to fill the few hours . &quot;
is he a collector that I ask ?
&quot; I already value &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 boards . &quot;
&quot; this sound panels , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I am not followed by him ) , clothing the walls of his living room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles , the result of his available income : he is now able to buy boards , which he could not afford to buy them , when he was released , when he was young and rich . &quot;
&quot; many things that I buy , are from the late six@@ ties , early 70@@ ies , which was released , when I was 11 or 12 . things , when I was probably something too young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it is true that those who buy boards , rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and likes to spend their own time , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I d@@ are not very much . &quot;
this is my L@@ aster .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at Si@@ ster Ray , believes that many customers who meets the You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; however , he has also noticed a new wave of people who have heard about the med@@ enh@@ pe , people who heard about the com@@ eback , and rely on to buy their old records . &quot;
&quot; from the talks , which I have led , people usually have collected about 1998 or in 1999 of their collection . &quot;
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records .
this would explain the boom of tr@@ ailers of a certain age .
but what about the inn@@ ate emotional meaning of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds in a shop such as ph@@ onica to detect that re@@ stores a so@@ othing community of like @-@ minded people .
&quot; according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers participated in the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;
some turn@@ around @-@ fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to go back to the stability of familiar sound controllers , of objects , the happ@@ enings imp@@ aired . &quot;
&quot; I think , sometimes it can be the filling of a void or pos@@ sessions of material pos@@ sessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot;
this is as a collector for me and I think that it is so many people .
it is a simple way to employ intellec@@ tu@@ ally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are like her social worker ! &quot; fl@@ aw a staff from a record stack . &quot;
&quot; a survey of the IC@@ M in April un@@ vei@@ led that almost 50 % of the people have bought a record for the last month , they have not been heard . &quot;
&quot; the survey was also out that 41 % have a record player that they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record , no record player . &quot;
at this time of the news report I would probably look very concerned while I was le@@ aved through a stack at Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations .
&quot; J@@ onny , 42 , which works in sounds of the Universe ( data count : three men aged aged ) , has noticed a &quot; trophy of the prec@@ inct &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; someone just came here recently here and said , &quot; &quot; I have no record player , but I would like to buy a radio record , so I can put them into the shelf &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a great percentage , but it definitely happens . &quot;
&quot; more product @-@ laser , less musi@@ c@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; we have people who say , &quot; I have no record player . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older that only slow down . &quot;
stop that has devoted to sound panels nearly a whole floor has a b@@ lower audience than I re@@ ing@@ ehe .
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists , the photos make teenage boys and women middle ages . &quot;
&quot; even though the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the front @-@ standing shops - Wild Be@@ asts New Testament - and sex@@ tu@@ ous pop instead of experimental jazz from the loud@@ speakers - it is good to see such a diversity among customers . &quot;
none of them looks onder@@ ously lonely but nag@@ ging psych@@ ic trau@@ mas are hard to det@@ ectable if you stand for someone over 30 seconds .
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs around the shop for a few minutes and regards the variety of plates available for sale . &quot;
it is more likely a man@@ nequ@@ ins as a grand@@ mother .
&quot; it does not deserve much , therefore the collecting of plates does not require real option , says it . &quot;
it costs a lot .
&quot; it is easy to hear music from one computer or another way , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; she drives with a loving sig@@ h . &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it really is unique .
&quot; my last stop is a business , which is said that a new generation of turn@@ tables are meant to be inspired : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; while I give the candidates , the Je@@ ans @-@ Hot@@ p@@ ants to patterns , watch out a group of young teen@@ ager , group@@ ed for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter superior to buy a cro@@ sle@@ y record player . &quot;
&quot; on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of plates of Adel@@ e , Je@@ ff Bu@@ ckl@@ ey , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; nobody sees it - maybe because they are only purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to grasp them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; sheet art . &quot;
&quot; but considering that any attraction for these items mean more money for the industry and to send some customers into the depths of So@@ hos for more , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; there is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , also the one that is most for some of the new units like records . &quot;
&quot; even though my after@@ for@@ ger@@ ies agree that the results of You@@ g@@ v vote , let them , at least in record business in Soho , the large number of female collectors and turn@@ tables that exist in reality , record business and in Onlin@@ e@@ for@@ en exist . &quot;
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
&quot; they spend their Thursday morning with certainty and safety not with be@@ ats by turn@@ tables of the Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through plates , while they ste@@ er the wrong look of an un@@ fur@@ tive , 30 @-@ year old moder@@ ator , above the shoulders of nothing a@@ hn@@ ut men medium age . &quot;

French Court re@@ jects an offer about demo@@ lition of shops in the jungle refuge@@ e camps .
&quot; a French court has rejected a special offer of the authorities in Calais , do@@ z@@ ens of pro@@ visional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais . &quot;
&quot; in case of court proceedings this week argu@@ ed the authorities in Calais that the state should be fu@@ ged , 72 pro@@ visional business , sell , hair@@ dressing services , or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in pro@@ visional restaurants . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ fecture of Calais was argu@@ ed that these places ought to settle down , because they would represent a parallel business , from which no taxes would be paid and which are a fire and san@@ itation risk . &quot;
&quot; humanitarian groups shared the court with that the shops and restaurants are important , as the free meals offered by the state supported Association and other groups , not enough food for growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they led out that pro@@ visional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need . &quot;
&quot; a court in Lille has decided that there would be no legal basis for the exclusion of people who operate 72 pro@@ visional business , but spatial a that the concerns of the pre@@ fecture of Calais . &quot;
&quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla , said that the food shops , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than just people to feed the &apos; in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas of quiet meeting between refugees and volunteers offer .
&quot; one of the places which was threatened by defe@@ ats , was the young Book Kids &apos; Café des Lag@@ ers , the non @-@ profit organization and 200 meals a day , English and French classes , as well as a consultation with asylum seek@@ ers , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
more than 17@@ 0.000 people have signed the Peti@@ tion to keep the kids &apos; café .
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian called it , that the closure for these children would be a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years old are old . &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
&quot; Germany A@@ aser must adapt to the next generation speed measurements : in various federal states , including in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new flash devices are tested , Tem@@ pos@@ u@@ ende are particularly effective . &quot;
the fut@@ uris@@ tic En@@ forcement trailer of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example at random points where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by police .
&quot; for example , on highway construction or to san@@ itation bridges with temporary springs , there is often no necessary infrastructure to provide with a stationary Bl@@ itzen to ensure compliance with speed rail . &quot;
a continuous design can be too dangerous or consuming .
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its cordless holds five days , the case data is encrypted via a modem . &quot;
laser measurement technology can also be captured all cars across multiple tracks simultaneously .
variable speed limit as well as passage to time , bicycles and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
&quot; in the high @-@ locked state , one can move the p@@ endant according to manufacturers with each car with a trailer h@@ itch . &quot;
&quot; so that he is not simply pushed , he is fed into the brass plant , so that the wheels in the ar@@ mo@@ red and inci@@ dentally disappear . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should be protected from se@@ ater before v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer for information by Vit@@ ronic is tested and used by Vit@@ ronic in various federal states . &quot;

great Britain takes silver in the 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by post after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold
&quot; the impressive performance of Great Britain at the 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by came at the finale on Thursday evening at the last hur@@ d@@ le in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were be@@ aten with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ fen@@ stage here in Rio . &quot;
&quot; Fi@@ ji er@@ tified a master class in handling , Side @-@ St@@ epp@@ ing , after@@ ward , line @-@ run and ro@@ cking power to win gold - their first Olym@@ ame@@ da@@ ille of any colour . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was destroyed by the not too bad comfort of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth in this day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which she sm@@ ote New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the distinct defeat of the ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ finals on the same day could be returned to them in the finals . &quot;
but irrespective of it could have be@@ aten a 15 @-@ man team in their form .
&quot; it could be a tro@@ st for GB - but will it probably not - that at least a burning tomorrow a gold medal around his neck is : Fi@@ j@@ is Ch@@ ef@@ ile Ben Ryan , the former Chief of England from Wim@@ bl@@ edon . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind it .
eight years ago she lost every game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
&quot; here , they see only one . &quot;
&quot; this fl@@ ap is w@@ oven , but progress is amazing . &quot;
Fi@@ ji began wonderful and did the GB@@ s come out of fun .
&quot; it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell to and Co. at , when I would run in driving buses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 to the top , as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with just four minutes of gameplay , Jerry Tu@@ wa@@ i also got another attack from the right corner that he walked . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB has hardly added to the ball .
&quot; a h@@ int@@ rag@@ ing T@@ ackle from Mitchell stops the mountain from Mann Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa , to achieve a third goal , but it has only stopped Fi@@ ji . &quot;
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua in the right corner a touch@@ down and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the revival and there was still over a minute game time ... in the first half .
&quot; V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u prec@@ eded by further weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB Teams and turbul@@ ent up to the line , to make a gate . &quot;
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
&quot; it is so , as if Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while UK still has been st@@ oned . &quot;
this is how it is .
&quot; GB led fundamental changes to the half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time , until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova went through to a brilliant mid@@ play von Fi@@ ji . &quot;
&quot; Dan Nor@@ ton started a trial for GB , made a touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game had been running for a long time in the South Se@@ as@@ sul@@ ans whose fans were sl@@ ed , flags and d@@ anced on the tri@@ b@@ une . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ zer put the cake in the cake with another attempt on the last seconds .
the PF@@ IF@@ F du@@ ck the fi@@ j@@ is in@@ im@@ pover@@ ished and the GB ma@@ stered in the law@@ ns .
early on the day Fi@@ ji Japan in the semi @-@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 defe@@ ats and Great Britain in South Africa in a scar@@ ce sem@@ inal match from the race - Great Britain conversion of difference .
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks in the first half towards the front , but Dan Nor@@ ton crossed the line with an impressive skir@@ ting work and achieved a gate among the post in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant Tac@@ tics from Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side teams , secured the profit - and therefore the silver medal . &quot;
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning through fight with the cancer of the trainer to the rowing
there will be no em@@ ot@@ inal gold than with these games and that is what hot .
&quot; from the first rowing up to the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve , enter into history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional importance in their gol@@ den@@ em moment at Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even though it was only the appl@@ ause that were on the ruin , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the Train@@ ers Robin Williams , was all present as it became the second ol@@ ag@@ old in the branch , the first women on the history of British sports , which laid out on such a scale . &quot;
&quot; their domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all her 39.@@ ter is un@@ preced@@ ented application , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant Ath@@ let@@ ins that reflect on the surface with the elegance of spon@@ ges , which does not reflect the nature of the trick . &quot;
&quot; behind every gold in the Ru@@ g , a Bat@@ a@@ illon will contribute to the incre@@ mental advances that make the difference and there was no one thing as the coach , which would not survive this day when he was diagnosed with him cancer . &quot;
&quot; as he said , he was ris@@ ky . &quot;
&quot; I had bladder cancer , the oper@@ able and they did it . &quot;
&quot; if you do not do that , it spreads everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a rather dirty situation .
it changes a little the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio had luck that he could begin at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , begin what inter@@ ruption kept on a minimum , in case that under such circumstances occurs the correct term . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to go back soon . &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in the hospital and ran on the station around - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough . &quot;
this is how it starts .
&quot; the herds in itself is a challenge , but this makes it a still greater . &quot;
&quot; in the un@@ medi@@ ability of the victory , their first thought went to Williams , who spent a ner@@ ves morning with something more than usual , and therefore tried to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; p@@ anning , which was as chief mann at the Royal Arti@@ ll@@ ery reg@@ iment in an application in Afghanistan , &quot; &quot; I was this week an emotional wre@@ ck . that &apos;s perhaps something extremely , but it means so much . &quot;
&quot; it just repeated , how much me this means , how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin worked forever . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
&quot; without Robin we would no one , therefore a massive thanks to him . he is the best coach of the world . &quot;
I could not have a better person for exercising or a better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have no race in the last five years .
the pair had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
&quot; even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark un@@ signed , st@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had a lot in reserve . &quot;
we were very caught at the moment .
&quot; Hel@@ en called &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important to not get away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not looking out to make something wrong .
&quot; we did not want to get a fire@@ works today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race what we did . &quot;
the pair will take a time for a year before taking decisions about his future .
&quot; Glo@@ ver has to appear next week on a wedding , their own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall . &quot;
now she wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
this would have done too much pressure .
in London it took about six months to concei@@ ve that I am a Olympi@@ asi@@ tism .
it was all so new for me and I was st@@ olen so .
&quot; here , it took about four minutes . &quot;
&quot; this feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot;
31 years of exempl@@ ary for clarity of clarity
&quot; the managing director of the water @-@ purpose group &quot; &quot; V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ ine , &quot; &quot; R@@ öl@@ t G@@ öl@@ ler , goes into retirement . &quot;
&quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; bay@@ ern@@ al &quot; . &quot; &quot;
a small frac@@ tional drinking association serves as a role model for the big water producers .
so it was some time in the original tone in a post of the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk .
little later the water forum was forced by the government of Unter@@ fran@@ ken to the Zw@@ eck@@ verband .
&quot; the work of the vector @-@ group &quot; &quot; bay@@ ern@@ al &quot; &quot; goes far as exempl@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; behind all this stands Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , the 31 years in the forced associates , 28 years as managing director . &quot;
&quot; now , he was re@@ tired in retirement age 65 years . &quot;
&quot; the drinking water @-@ purpose association with headquarters in K@@ ott@@ endorf , community of Breit@@ brunn , promotes year about 15@@ 0000 cu@@ bic meters of water and supplies 32 places and hamlet with approximately 5500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; member states are the congreg@@ ations of the Church of Kirch@@ schl@@ ter , Breit@@ brunn , lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Judgment . &quot;
for more cities and municipalities there are water supply agreements .
&quot; the current chair , Wi@@ eg@@ ns Mayor &apos;s may@@ or in Ger@@ tru@@ d B@@ ühl ( FW ) , rem@@ inded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler 1985 as a water@@ bed and was appointed as the Managing Director of T@@ eck@@ asts . &quot;
&quot; its tasks have been very diverse and they extended from the water @-@ building and maintenance activities , the budget creation , lim@@ ulation of fees and contributions to emergency measures at weekends , &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
&quot; outstanding events called it to start the commissioning and initiation of the new well ( 1994 ) , ground @-@ work@@ flows in the area of the new well ( 1998 ) and compensation for farmers , the restoration of a central computer control ( 2004 ) , and the bat@@ ching of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the bat@@ ching of water cables . &quot;
&quot; I have not given any stand@@ still , and you have always recorded new additions , because water life and drinking water was the most important food . &quot;
&quot; in their Lau@@ da@@ ti@@ o , she pra@@ ised id@@ ll@@ ers , reliable and accurate service over 31 years . &quot;
he has worked with a lot of heart for his water @-@ purpose and he has lived the water @-@ purpose association than it would be his own company .
a few weeks ago he has presented as a real practitioner of the success of the V@@ eit@@ h @-@ group to nit@@ rate prot@@ esters before the water forum of the district sub@@ fran@@ ken .
for this he received a lot of recognition and praise .
&quot; Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , pra@@ ised B@@ öl@@ ler Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ vers , who worked with him for 28 years . &quot;
he is the best water@@ bed and he was a loyal boy .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as highlights from his point of view he called the Brun@@ n@@ en@@ bau and the re@@ structured of the constra@@ int .
but the biggest challenge and the hard@@ est use were however the pi@@ ping at the high @-@ level in a church l@@ esi@@ der on a 3rd of January .
&quot; here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night through , so that the localities with water could be supplied . &quot;
&quot; also the supply of Neu@@ brunn , one can once only maintain , because one filled the high capacity of P@@ ett@@ stadt with sl@@ ender . &quot;
the management of drinking water @-@ related Association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from lau@@ ter who enters the succession of Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler .
&quot; the soprano Anna Net@@ re@@ b@@ ko is open with the au@@ tism of her son Ti@@ ago , and turns to other interested parents : &quot; &quot; you must have the courage to speak about it . &quot;

steel - Ligh@@ thouse for the German steel industry
the kr@@ isen@@ das explo@@ ded and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains at an additional cost in meg@@ acities .
&quot; financial stres@@ ses , which are threatened by the industry from the green stream @-@ promotion , are from the table . &quot;
&quot; it is lead in the liberation of renewable energy consumption at the inventory of self @-@ electricity production in the German steel industry , said Bundes@@ poli@@ sm@@ ini@@ ster Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Fri@@ day@@ edition ) . &quot;
I am truly happy that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years .
&quot; the European Commission was initially planned to use the steel producer , the gases from the testi@@ cles to generate electricity generation for own consumption , to ask for the cas@@ hier . &quot;
the steel industry dro@@ ving additional costs from 120 to 240 million euros per year .
&quot; Gabriel told the WA@@ Z , it now give a basic certificate with the European Commission for talks with Com@@ peti@@ tioner Mar@@ gre@@ the Vest@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; only when generators are replaced in the steel works , in case a EEG envel@@ ope of 20 percent . &quot;
but even this will not be raised in the steel industry .
the IG Metall welcomed the unification of Germany with the European Commission for self @-@ proof production .
this means that the status quo of the previous regulation will be largely determined .
particular importance have the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; steel is future &quot; , &quot; this is a first step . &quot;
&quot; others must follow . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; even in the reform of the emission types are climate and employment targets , &quot; stated IG Metall @-@ Chief Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from the financial crisis since the 2008 financial crisis and a significant price pressure .
last year the situation continues to be tigh@@ tened than the world &apos;s largest terrestrial China given the weak@@ ened steel demand in the world market .
European Manufacturer throw Chinese steel concerts in price du@@ mping .
in the course of this year the situation has something relaxed .
&quot; for one hand , vei@@ led in@@ tox@@ ins on impor@@ ter effect , and on the other hand the economic insights into China are emerging . &quot;
&quot; un@@ clear , how long the pricing is sustainable . &quot;
German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp remained careful on Thursday .
&quot; finally , the prices would have more than stagn@@ ating . &quot;
the sector is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reduction .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp wanted not to exclude the closing of individual works as well .
in the German steel industry the end of 2015 around 8@@ 6000 people were busy .
&quot; in July , the German steel producer despite rising prices and increasing orders are careful . &quot;
&quot; they produced more than 3.4 million tonnes of almost six percent less rough theft than in the previous year , as the economic union of steel on Friday . &quot;
&quot; after a short increase in May , the multitude now went back to the second month of succession . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the production is increased by two percent under the previous year . &quot;
the association counts in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation with an increasing output .
&quot; community , spirit , health : sing do seniors good
&quot; the S@@ ingen has accompanied her whole life : as young girl she was at school choir , in the teacher studies she had the comp@@ artment of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old in a seniors @-@ choir . &quot;
&quot; singing moves me - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; describes it . &quot;
&quot; after a sample they feel balanced , cheerful and a whole more lively , says it . &quot;
she is doing something good in doing so doing her health and spirit .
&quot; for singing is equal to several perspectives , a great hobby for seniors , says Erhard Hac@@ kler from the German senior Bundes@@ liga . &quot;
&quot; most seniors singing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded the joy of music , describes Hac@@ kler . &quot;
through regular connections they can make social contacts and maintain .
&quot; for frequently , social and familiar structures at the age of , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; to speak and organize themselves , to be able to leave and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of co@@ existence . &quot;
&quot; singing can be exhau@@ sting in a positive sense , means Hac@@ kler . &quot;
for doing seniors a deep and controlled breathing .
&quot; who regularly demands his lungs also in everyday life , not as fast as the pu@@ ste . &quot;
&quot; even if it is about getting the sound of the voice at the age , singing is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; on the elderly there has often been a very special effect , Ursula L@@ enz says from the Federal Labour Community of the Sen@@ iors . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations , the common sense had a much higher priority , it belon@@ ged to everyday life , both at school and in leisure . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz frequently ob@@ serves that the singing or hearing of songs in older men have arous@@ ed many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth . &quot;
&quot; by lyrics , and especially mel@@ o@@ dies , they denied any det@@ er@@ eal infections in long term events . &quot;
&quot; in singing , the head is also required for a special performance , explains L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , concentrate on their own voice and on a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cog@@ nitive challenge . &quot;
&quot; older people who live alone , practice not just on yourself . &quot;
another positive aspect is the recognition that one lear@@ ns through the singing in the choir means Hac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
also the self @-@ esteem grows due to the singing in the choir .
&quot; to show himself , if I am long for something , I will be better and watch@@ ful about me - this experience strengthens . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to begin with the singing , so there is enough . &quot;
&quot; who wants to try a new hobby , should not hesitate - even if he means , little talent to have slo@@ ping L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; you s@@ ings not alone - at 50 sin@@ ful men , who hear it even if a sound is standing next to it ? &quot;
in search of the suitable offer you have seniors different ways , says Hac@@ kler .
&quot; someone s@@ ings out of the familiar circle in a senior &apos;s choir , one can easily connect . &quot;
many cities also offer over@@ views over the choirs in the area .
&quot; who wants to sing in a church chor@@ us , can turn right to the church or the church . &quot;
many senior choirs will also be found via the Internet .
&quot; who has no access to the internet , can ask the family , friends or neighbours around the Internet . &quot;
&quot; who would like to sing , should necessarily connect to a choir , wit@@ t Hac@@ kler . &quot;
singing does the soul good and has something be@@ fre@@ eing - this applies to any age .
Cats are responding sensitive to the hang@@ over of kitt@@ ens of young animals
bi@@ ologists have examined in Hannover and what effect the h@@ ops of cat@@ bab@@ ys on adult animals has .
&quot; to her surprise , the mi@@ k also left the males not cold - however they kept in contrast to the females always alike . &quot;
female cats can recognize the arousal level of cat bab@@ ys at the Gre@@ ys of the Small .
&quot; they react by ten percent faster to lu@@ te of kitt@@ ens who have found themselves out in great distress , such as scientists found by the veterinary university and the Medical University Hannover ( MH@@ H ) . &quot;
K@@ ater may also react to the har@@ p of kitt@@ y - but always the same .
&quot; evi@@ d@@ ently the acou@@ sti@@ cal differences between the mi@@ stress of less and strongly arous@@ ed juven@@ iles for the males either not perc@@ ep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from the MH@@ H . &quot;
&quot; it is first authorized in the study , which was published on this Friday in the magazine &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ u@@ tionary Biology &quot; . &quot; &quot;
in a previous investigation the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of the kitt@@ y fri@@ ght distingu@@ ishes with the ur@@ gency of their assistance .
they were observed a total of nine adults K@@ ater and eight kil@@ n from the animal hus@@ band@@ ment of the MH@@ H .
they were played for a ro@@ p of little ones who were taken off for three minutes from the litter box and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
&quot; for the other , they were faced with scre@@ ams of stronger stir@@ red kitt@@ ens that were additionally up@@ lifted . &quot;
the researchers keep their results despite the small sample of the im@@ pedi@@ ments .
&quot; all the females , even those who had no own off@@ spring , re@@ acted differenti@@ ated to the Schre@@ ie , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot;
they turned out more quickly to the speaker if the ru@@ p of the very mature kitt@@ ens have played .
this ability might be inn@@ ate or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; one surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in . &quot;
in the past scientists have already examined several times in humans the reactions of women and men on baby no@@ ises .
&quot; also some studies show that women were sensitive to inf@@ ants , regardless of whether they were already mothers or not , reported the Bi@@ olog@@ in Marina Sche@@ dule . &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ ski acc@@ esses with &quot; g@@ ala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ ek is a football legend in Turkey .
in Turkey against the ru@@ sty soccer star Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r has been er@@ ved .
it is thrown into being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the coup attempt , Turkey takes place again an important soccer game . &quot;
&quot; in front of the Du@@ el of Erz@@ ri@@ v@@ alen between B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as Istanbul and Luke Po@@ dol@@ skis Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul to the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; &quot; business as usual &quot; &quot; is said . &quot;
&quot; already in the im@@ position of the exp@@ iry of the exp@@ iry of the re @-@ storm in July , the government , the everyday life of norm@@ ali@@ ases shall not be affected . &quot;
&quot; this does not apply to those who susp@@ ects the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup . &quot;
it is also not going to stop before football .
against the former St@@ ark@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r presented the Prosec@@ ut@@ or one ar@@ rest warran@@ t .
&quot; accordingly , by now , the south of America living in America in the south , to be a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
&quot; addi@@ ction should be p@@ endant of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible from the President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an for the coup . &quot;
&quot; this is true of the first time for 90 days , and in fact , it does not affect the lives of most Turks but as good as no effect . &quot;
the next &quot; democracy @-@ w@@ aking &quot; on public places throughout the country has declared Erd@@ og@@ an on Wednesday for over .
sports is - as the whole country - split in tr@@ ailers and opponents of Erd@@ og@@ an .
especially fans of the workers &quot; clubs B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as are traditionally not among the friends of the President .
&quot; but the gro@@ s of the Turks , however , given the dramatic experience in history , is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties . &quot;
even the fans themselves agree - no matter whether you be@@ have a heart for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as .
&quot; in Po@@ int@@ si@@ eger &quot; g@@ ala , &quot; it will be especially coming back on Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
his sport value presented the Köl@@ ner in the expi@@ red season under evidence : with 17 gates and nine templates in all cont@@ ests ended the 31 @-@ year @-@ old his first playing time as a Top@@ ic of his association .
in the end@@ game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he achieved the 1 : 0 @-@ Sieg@@ tre@@ k .
&quot; the newspaper &quot; F@@ AN@@ AT@@ IK &quot; was che@@ ered him , &quot; he was the best in the square . &quot;
he completed the season in an excellent way and secured with his team the trophy .
&quot; thanks &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; found the dis@@ appoint@@ ing season for the record master a irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able conclusion . &quot;
&quot; after the pre @-@ round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; Lion &quot; also differ@@ ed from the Europa League early . &quot;
in the south per Li@@ g it was only to rank six .
the season was not good .
the trophy was the only way to win something .
&quot; we have managed and this is the most important , &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
for Master B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as the game was going to be better .
&quot; especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who performed with 26 Se@@ as@@ on@@ ers as a sweet@@ per @-@ go@@ al@@ enk@@ ö@@ nig that put the base to the 14th title . &quot;
that is also the reason that the fans hope to return to the return of the 31 @-@ year old .
&quot; at the AC Florence under the contract and in B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as , the Gom@@ ez gave to the coup attempt to return , because of the political situation in the country after his EM vacation did not return . &quot;
&quot; if Mario went to us to come , he must only say it , &quot; quoted the &quot; K@@ icker &quot; Club@@ chef F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; to do so the stor@@ ms would have to be ready to give rise to around a third of his to 7.5 million euros , Or@@ man made clear : &quot; his sal@@ ary in Florence can we do not pay . &quot;
&quot; despite mental , these athletes still have medals opportunities at Olympia in Rio &quot;
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice for D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ owa may not start in Rio .
others over@@ led ath@@ le@@ tics sin@@ ner can only lau@@ gh it - they fight in Rio to medals .
the issue is determined according to the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games in Rio .
&quot; the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ owa , which was indic@@ ted after a doping Sper@@ re , which was indic@@ ted out shortly before playing , was mer@@ ging out and hidden in her start ( 100 meters chest ) . &quot;
it offered a sk@@ ur@@ ry scenario : with a built smile she was still sm@@ elled into the hall and had prov@@ oked with her appearance .
&quot; as a set @-@ up , that she will not get gold , the audience broke out into a h@@ ub@@ storm . &quot;
&quot; but there are many other spor@@ tsmen , who are going to start in Rio for the Olympic Games in Rio . &quot;
here an overview :
&quot; Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old belongs to the most contro@@ versi@@ al figures in the ath@@ le@@ tics . &quot;
he had been locked for two times because of di@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
&quot; since his spell the Olympi@@ asi@@ eger from 2004 and ex @-@ World Champion is even faster than before , he is about 100 m in 9,@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered the biggest Chall@@ eng@@ er of Uz@@ ain Bol@@ t . &quot;
&quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ y@@ ce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / Jam@@ aica ) : the two @-@ painting tournament had to sit down in 2010 after having been proven the intake of pain relief with Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don . &quot;
they had had strong to@@ he@@ ada@@ che after a surgery , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : 2011 was the Olympi@@ asi@@ tism of 2012 , World Championship in 2013 and European Championships from 2010 to 2016 , positive on the ver@@ itable stim@@ ul@@ ant means of meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine . &quot;
Per@@ kovic was pun@@ ish@@ able in@@ gest@@ ing and was locked up six months .
the four most advanced thro@@ ws this year go to the account of the great gold fav@@ ori@@ i@@ tin .
&quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the Beijing Olym@@ pics and two world champion about 400 m , was tested in 2010 positive and 21 months . &quot;
an instrument for penis enlargement must be responsible for be@@ aten Mer@@ ritt .
this year the 30 @-@ year @-@ old over 200 and 400 m is the fastest man in the world .
&quot; I@@ wan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ ing , Belarus ) : probably hardly a athletes were buried so many medals . &quot;
&quot; so , T@@ ich@@ on his World Cup titles from 2005 nine years later , after having noticed testosterone &quot;
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to leave Olympia @-@ Silver 2004 for Ster@@ oid D@@ op@@ ings and the EM @-@ title 2006 because of Test@@ osterone abuse .
the bronze medals of the Olympic Games in 2008 was given back to a third part of the International Sport@@ Tribunal .
with 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m it is located on rank two of the world list .
&quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the world championship and Gold@@ fav@@ ori@@ ine was first tested in May , but it may still start in Rio . &quot;
&quot; at the 29 year old World Cup in were found evidence on taking a ban &apos;s supplement , the spar@@ row of the world @-@ anti @-@ mental agency WA@@ DA fell mil@@ de and ran already on 13 July . &quot;
Bom@@ ben@@ cy in Thailand - W@@ inner has been in@@ ju@@ red - Mul@@ tic@@ ated T@@ ote
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand stand with the woman in contact , said the speaker of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Fri@@ day@@ . &quot;
&quot; they suffered schn@@ apps , and be dealt with in the hospital , but have already left them again . &quot;
she has planned her home for the beginning of September .
&quot; whether the other explo@@ sions are on the ho@@ liday@@ island Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern towns of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ GA , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ on as well as Austrian citizenship are still un@@ clear . &quot;
&quot; the State Department may stand in touch with the local authorities , so the be@@ di@@ ll . &quot;
&quot; at about 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , Hua H@@ in were first explo@@ ded on Thursday morning in a &quot; &quot; two bom@@ bs &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to police a Tha@@ il@@ änder@@ in killed and about 20 people have been wo@@ unded , including the Austrian , three German , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; Friday morning again two spra@@ yers went high , according to the authorities a further person was killed . &quot;
also from Ph@@ u@@ ket in the morning a bom@@ bs was reported .
during the det@@ on@@ ation near the tourists popular bathing resort Pat@@ ong was wo@@ unded by police fields as a taxi driver .
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ eastern coast of the country , then a further bom@@ b , which k@@ ills an urban deposit . &quot;
&quot; according to the authorities in a flower , in front of the prec@@ inct of the coastal police force the air went into the air . &quot;
&quot; finally , det@@ on@@ ations demanded again in Ph@@ ang N@@ GA and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ om@@ on on the southeast coast , several Ver@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; one go from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hua H@@ in , it was called . &quot;
&quot; the bom@@ bing type bear the same manuscript , &quot; said armies of Dan@@ ai Of meth@@ av@@ ee Fri@@ day@@ early in front of journalists . &quot;
we assume that it is a co @-@ ordin@@ ated attack .
&quot; it is too early to express themselves to possible motives - probably , it is about the actions of Muslim re@@ bels . &quot;
&quot; Thai media also wanted to recognise a pattern in the attacks , which is typical of the bom@@ bing separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , the Thai police declared , the attacks are not in connection with the Islam@@ ist rebel@@ lion or with international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is just local sab@@ ot@@ age restricted to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a sp@@ okes@@ person in Bangkok . &quot;
&quot; instead , one rather go out of that the bom@@ bs were put to the opponents of the ruling jun@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; the authorities would have been given secrecy in the last days of secrecy in the south of the country , but they have not been informed of the exact time and places . &quot;
&quot; still be un@@ clear , which group behind the attacks . &quot;
&quot; the police dism@@ is@@ sed its officials in the whole country to strengthen safety around important government buildings as well as airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and am@@ usement districts . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand there are still smaller bom@@ bing ra@@ inf@@ all , but they usually are not directed against tourists . &quot;
&quot; in Hua H@@ in is a palace , which was used over the year of Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j . &quot;
after the nun@@ m@@ eh@@ ri@@ gen Bom@@ ben@@ explo@@ sions recommends the Austrian Foreign Ministry on his Homepage with the instructions of Thai security authorities .
&quot; high security risk ( security stage 3 ) pun@@ ched for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ iw@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah Vi@@ ews and surroundings . &quot;
&quot; in disputes between security forces and Muslim populations , there will be no necessary travels in these provinces . &quot;
increased safety risks ( security stage 2 ) for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a contro@@ versi@@ al referendum on one of the jun@@ ta &apos;s army .
this is the military influence also in the years to come .
&quot; Jun@@ ta Chief and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ Ch@@ a said , the bom@@ bs have been an attempt to sti@@ p@@ ate chaos , while the country toward stability , improving the economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military jun@@ ta , which had sei@@ zed the power in 2014 after a phase of bloo@@ dy un@@ rest , considers himself to have led the kingdom again to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , the military has not been able to get a grip on the handle for years in the extreme south of the country . &quot;
more than 6@@ 500 people were killed in the conflict .
&quot; shortly after a year ago in Bangkok , in a presence of a popular Hind@@ u @-@ Sch@@ purely 20 people were killed - most of them foreign tourists . &quot;
it was the bloo@@ dy attack of the recent history of the country .
the right &quot; identity movement &quot; is given into the visor of the Federal State for Constitu@@ tional Protection .
&quot; after several state tr@@ un@@ ks , the Constitu@@ tional er in the Bund have also put under observation . &quot;
&quot; we see at the &apos; identi@@ al movement &apos; cl@@ ue for efforts against the detached democratic principles , &quot; said the Constitu@@ tional director Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate of the Deutsche Presse @-@ Agentur in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; thus , the emig@@ rants Islamic faith or from the Middle East are diff@@ used in extrem@@ ist ways . &quot;
that is why we watch the movement well .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it is directed against &quot; Mul@@ tic@@ ult@@ i @-@ w@@ ahn &quot; , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; and the &quot; loss of own identity by alien@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; graduated in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thuringia - watching the &quot; identity &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ din@@ ed , his authority have worked closely with the offices in the decision . &quot;
&quot; groups such as the &apos; identity movement &apos; try to pick up their target group , where it stands , &quot; &quot; said the Constitu@@ tional director . &quot;
&quot; generally try extre@@ mi@@ sts , they speak with you@@ thful language often talk with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Islam@@ ists do not as well as legal extre@@ mi@@ sts . &quot;
this is not concrete advertising for one &apos;s own cause .
the propaganda is to speak the people emotion@@ ally .
young people are sus@@ cep@@ tible in special manner .
this is dangerous .
&quot; last , from several Länder had given reports on contacts of &quot; identity &quot; for Af@@ D politicians . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ din@@ ed , I have no results . &quot;
&quot; for the Constitu@@ tional protection , possible contacts of this kind only was relevant to a certain point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the party - in this case , the Af@@ D - through certain persons , the extrem@@ ist are changing , their target device will change and so extrem@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; thus , there is whether such persons are able to have control over the party . &quot;
this is not recogni@@ zable .
&quot; with a view of the significant increase of legal criminal off@@ ences and attacks on Asyl@@ um and Refu@@ ge@@ es , Ma@@ din@@ ed , he would not speak about new rights in this context . &quot;
but we have observed in the past few years that it can give ri@@ ster@@ ile structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Free Group .
&quot; it can be quite good that other legal entities or small groups formed , the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refuge@@ e sh@@ one or attacks from other extrem@@ ist moti@@ fs . &quot;
a nationwide or pan @-@ wide control of rec@@ ord@@ ror@@ ism is but not recogni@@ zable .
the former groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; thus , Ma@@ din@@ ed about that many gri@@ ps went to the account of people who did not appear before in the right scene . &quot;
this is the wor@@ rying .
many of the susp@@ ects in attacks on Asyl@@ um are not known as crimin@@ als , politically motivated or tr@@ ailers of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; many people have committed criminal off@@ ences which were before with legal extre@@ mi@@ sts , who were perhaps politically in@@ different , or have chosen for example CD@@ U , SPD or Left , who was radic@@ alised by right @-@ extrem@@ ist mood . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes the Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
not always determine the Olympi@@ ad or world @-@ corro@@ bor@@ row the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the cour@@ ageous appearance of RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer play in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly over@@ heated s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia is so slow that he could no longer see in the TV @-@ images . &quot;
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut was selected .
in social networks G@@ ets got subsequently to vir@@ al Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it .
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old with a retreat of 48 seconds ended his run and occupy the 5@@ 9th position of 59 Star@@ ts . &quot;
but it was rather its not just sports figure which attracted attention to the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still participate in the Olympic Games ?
Ethiop@@ ians got a special start@@ up from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries more known .
&quot; since in U@@ thop@@ e@@ dic@@ s the most spor@@ tsmen , just wanted to do something else . &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first sur@@ names made the round .
some media used it as &quot; RO@@ BEL of the whale . &quot;
&quot; in the di@@ lu@@ tion to a &quot; &quot; wellbeing &quot; &quot; the Sun &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; about him funny . &quot;
&quot; his time , he proposed only with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters of Fre@@ isti@@ l , played there no role . &quot;
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the e@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
at the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney the run of Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i for medi@@ al attention .
memorable was the appearance of the swimming pool from equ@@ atorial Guinea as he had to enter in a roll over 100 meters of Fre@@ isti@@ l .
fr@@ en@@ etic was initiated at M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i at that time .
the time 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned only eight months before Olympia and had never taken such a long distance before competitions .

GF@@ K @-@ leadership enters the dis@@ appoint@@ ing business
the consumer @-@ based company Gf@@ K divi@@ des its head Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the re@@ sign@@ ations were suddenly there - but not quite surprising .
&quot; the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K caused , that the chair of Vor@@ ar@@ sch@@ ef Matthias Hart@@ mann becomes all the more secure , the longer the success of him promised successes . &quot;

accidents - Bus Fl@@ ange in Kru@@ mm@@ age : eight Ver@@ sions
if an accident of a travel agency with 43 seniors and guests are killed on Thursday in Kru@@ mm@@ age ( Land@@ scape Aur@@ i ) eight people .
two of the in@@ suffered suffered severe injuries led the police with .
&quot; the 66 years old driver of the bus of a travel enterprise from Eisen@@ nach had to leave their details , according to a opposite l@@ aster , the partly on the driving track . &quot;
&quot; the bus came to the right of the road and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch , as a speaker of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported . &quot;
&quot; due to the location of the bus , the persons could not leave the bus to self @-@ employed , &quot; she said . &quot;
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade liber@@ ated the in@@ m@@ ates .
&quot; six b@@ ail@@ ments and a emergency car came to the un@@ fail@@ ort on the provincial road 2 . &quot;
the in@@ last travel@@ er were brought back to the Kru@@ mm@@ ers district P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of travel business .
the investig@@ ators demanded the trucks and possible witnesses to sign up in the police .
&quot; the fees per cu@@ bic meters of the water is from 1 October 2016 for the field of wast@@ ew@@ ater Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl 3,@@ 44 instead of the only twenty years ; for Z@@ ult@@ enberg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3,@@ 36 Euro ( until now 26@@ ,50 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( until 2.@@ 18 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the se@@ wage fee will then be able to once again increase when appropriate enhancement measures will be necessary . &quot;
after a excessive lim@@ estone the se@@ wage rate is then stored in Az@@ endorf then at 4.4 euros per cu@@ bic meters .
&quot; how Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( C@@ SU ) reported , was noted in the approval of the household by the land@@ fills Kul@@ mb@@ ach , that for these se@@ wage systems have been set up . &quot;
the Kas@@ endorf market is committed to a legal basis due to legal principles that operate facilities to cost @-@ end .
&quot; from 1 October 2016 , citizens and the commercial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Z@@ ult@@ enberg need to take deeper into the money bag . &quot;
the ag@@ it@@ ators increase between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; how administration manager Herbert Schmidt was applied to the Panel , was a re@@ escal@@ ation of the fees necessary for se@@ wage systems . &quot;
in the period from October 2016 until September 2020 will be even over@@ - or sub@@ covers from the previous calendar period .
&quot; the engra@@ ved ag@@ it@@ ating oils justified by all three se@@ wage systems by relatively small facilities with a very low se@@ wage attack , which rises between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cu@@ bic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; thus , due to the low distribution basis , for example , grants to the repairs of several thousands of Euro . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the wast@@ ew@@ ater treatment will be easily declined in all three plants . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in the back calendar period at all three plants , not least due to their age , san@@ iti@@ zes and repair applications have fallen in a significant extent . &quot;
&quot; the plant in Az@@ endorf was nearly 30 years old , the equipment for Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth , as well as Z@@ ult@@ enberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt pointed out that in the se@@ wage plant Az@@ endorf the mechanical ventilation system had to be exchanged due to damage .
&quot; in the P@@ ump@@ werk Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl , which had to be out@@ dated nearly 20 years old for the reason and at the pond water level , the plum@@ ber had to be built for almost 20 years and can also keep an additional air carrier to keep the water @-@ legal requirements even in the future . &quot;
Schmidt : &quot; to these extraordinary expenses came to take into account the continued support and maintenance costs according to the new calendar period .
the same applies to electricity costs resulting in the previous lim@@ estone in the years 2011 / 2012 still considerably below the current level .
stone houses rose significantly that at low water fall in the three plants make the expenses for operation and maintenance . &quot;
&quot; thereby , added Schmidt , the market &apos;s market of large under@@ entertainment costs in the se@@ wage plant during the past 20 years . &quot;
&quot; the situation for the above @-@ mentioned systems will continue to be prec@@ arious on the duration of stone houses on the long run , especially since the supply area of the wast@@ ew@@ ater association &apos;s Fries@@ en@@ bach@@ tal is not able to expand these plants as it is around de@@ ath@@ etic facilities . &quot;
Bulgaria for the first time in 8 months Inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria in July 1 % was on a monthly basis .
&quot; this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) , and the first over zero since October last year , considered positive 0.@@ 2 % . &quot;
the annual average de@@ flation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.3 % .
&quot; consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1,@@ 0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.@@ 0 % . &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was compared to December 2015 ) amoun@@ ted to 0.2 % and annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 amoun@@ ted to 0.2 % .

Snap@@ chat &quot; anim@@ e &quot; effect as Asian car@@ ic@@ ature cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed
&quot; Snap@@ chat says that this filter is animated @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say that it is uns@@ ensi@@ bly towards breed . &quot;
&quot; with its filter tool , it allows Snap@@ chat about 150 million daily U@@ sers to change reality and to play with identi@@ ties to the same way , which already borders as absur@@ de . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lich@@ tenstein painting . &quot;
&quot; the filters are un@@ flo@@ wering , autonom@@ ous tools that produce more than 30 million improved ones per day . &quot;
all mis@@ steps are transferred to the public .
Snap@@ chat filters have moved in the past criticism that they were acc@@ used to propag@@ ate the app Black@@ face convey@@ ors or white skin as beauty ideal .
&quot; when these week gave a filter a filter , which gave them sm@@ ug@@ g@@ ging , false teeth and un@@ spoiled che@@ eks , there was a few critics of a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; &quot; money &quot; . &quot; &quot;
they asked if these repeated contro@@ vers@@ y sur@@ rendered to a greater problem that the company has with diversity .
&quot; the news and the rebel@@ lion were widely used on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and motherboard , a day after Snap@@ chat , that it would have disabled disabled . &quot;
the company offered an exc@@ use : the filter was intended as a tri@@ bute to anim@@ e characters and not intended as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
&quot; but outer standing , the r@@ attle m@@ atism have experienced , remembered the filter at hur@@ t@@ ful peti@@ ees . &quot;
others have decided the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student , whose T@@ we@@ et was widely used over the photos that the filter was &quot; hur@@ t@@ ful and pun@@ k . &quot;
they added that &quot; it is difficult to ar@@ gue with the counter@@ f@@ ting of a very contradi@@ c@@ tory Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not logged in , but that the money was with@@ drawn into the worth@@ less extre@@ mi@@ sts . &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses these cultural Stol@@ wi@@ red .
&quot; the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversi@@ fication and integration process , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the equipment we all hold in hand . &quot;
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people - who are living in a race as their older counter@@ player - could not go out of what raise awareness .
&quot; when one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats fil@@ ters a picture created that for a user is loaded , so it &apos;s much harder that such things was un@@ noticed when it was formerly the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year K@@ atie Zh@@ u in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Zh@@ u decided to work as a product man@@ ag@@ ress and engineering in the medium to clear her Snap@@ chat account for others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an attachment for the medium and in a telephone interview , she said that they believe that r@@ ens @-@ related contro@@ vers@@ y will reflect a lack of diversity among the settings in Snap@@ chat . &quot;
Zh@@ u critic@@ ised the large part white , only male leadership and ended their assignment with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ ete@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either they do not have several representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; the Chinese @-@ American Zh@@ u , &quot; or they have people with other skin colours that they are working there , but not in positions they feel safe or well @-@ feeling what to say about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint , the snap@@ chat mostly left un@@ answered . &quot;
the company does not publish numbers on diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
&quot; on Thursday , there are Snap@@ chat starting to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his staff , but according to a sp@@ okes@@ person , the company has recently focused a personnel responsible which focused on population groups and on internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; Zh@@ u said in their turn , they said their Snap@@ chat account will be closed and added , &quot; I ask myself whether they need more users like us to say that this is not o.@@ k@@ . &quot;
Military Con@@ duc@@ tive IS@@ IS secret service information ; presents Committee of Congress Festival
&quot; military development of the United States Central Command changed trac@@ eable information to record an optimal image of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq , and Syria being the actual condition of the Congress in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the pro@@ visional report , created by a task Force of the Republi@@ can members of the dispute agents , secrecy and the Wehr@@ bud@@ get@@ es , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command intelligence services , which reported as fores@@ aw their duty @-@ up to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; the Central Command , brief Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in Tampa , Florida , which controls the American military installations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; message service information , which were typically sent from high @-@ level Cent@@ Com Kom@@ man@@ de@@ uren , they were allowed to have had a positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism as being the actual state services , and were consistently positive as analyses of other news @-@ services , &quot; quoted a newspaper article . &quot;
&quot; what is done in the Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers are suffering , if poor analyses of our political leaders are presented , &quot; said Ken Cal@@ ver@@ t , rep@@ ublic@@ s member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ enh@@ ouses . &quot;
the leadership in the Cent@@ Com range up to the top top of the organization .
the ten @-@ sided report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the education of Ira@@ qi armed forces .
&quot; although there is no direct reference to that government tips given under Obama instructions to alter the reports , it shows how analy@@ sing the pressure from their fore@@ laws , an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic state , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of the year 2015 there were many Central Command Press releases , statements and statements in front of the Congress clearly more positive than it corresponds to the facts . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ Com has been publicly known that a military recon@@ quest is already beginning in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ su@@ l , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic state . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigation , so much clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Congress of K@@ ans@@ as , in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of 2014 to the middle of the year 2015 , the leaders of the Central Command changed the following reports to hold the threat of IS@@ IS in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; the rep@@ ublic@@ ans called the Task Force to live , after being played by an@@ alysts about the mani@@ pulation of reports from the Islamic State . &quot;
the report published on Thursday will continue to be completed by detailed findings during the investigation .
&quot; in addition , additional investigation of Cent@@ Com reports have been underway by the General Secretary of Defence . &quot;
democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published on Thursday their own findings which agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 the Cent@@ Com had an overall restricted process for creating a legal obligation to IS@@ IL and the Ira@@ qi security services , Member of the Executive House for Adam B. ship , in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; this process , so Mr. ship , &quot; del@@ ayed the publication of subsequent reports , &quot; sh@@ aking the mor@@ ality under an@@ alysts and &quot; gave a little room for devi@@ ating opinions . &quot;
&quot; however , Mr. ship and Democrats gave no evidence of an intervention of the White House in the Cent@@ Com analy@@ st regarding a &quot; particular political opinion &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the meetings were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Beast &quot; .
&quot; last August reported the New York Times of investig@@ ates reported by the General Secretary of the Pent@@ agon , which were included in the complaints of Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; L@@ t. C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a press release of the Pent@@ agon , gave no reports of Congress , while the investigation of the General Insp@@ ection would still be in progress . &quot;
&quot; but he also gave us that &quot; experts at times quite diver@@ ging opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that the Ministry of Defence and Defence Minister will be a contro@@ vers@@ y discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot;
the investig@@ ational impacts on the issue of a successful aviation campaign in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion which is now being made by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
&quot; however , the alleg@@ ations of the last year have raised the issue that President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest debates of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism relating to the sal@@ ari@@ al form@@ ations over the Islamic State remind of more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , a font in which the recommendations of many an@@ alysts agree on the recommendations of many an@@ alysts in Iraq and have little time based on the consequences of the invasion of 2003 thoughts . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ dies also played a key role in the u@@ prising against the current reporting of the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team around Mr. Hoo@@ ker had no significant impact on funds from the government &apos;s government on the financial markets , since these pro@@ visional refin@@ ing had taken into operation in order to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; however , this knowledge was not published , reported the times in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ re@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger command , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legisl@@ ature because of its excessive positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
general Austin went to retirement in April and was replaced by the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the USA won fourth match in the field @-@ hockey of women , a show@@ down with the UK . &quot;
&quot; a day after they had shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American field ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ team of women in a match on Thursday against India that Americans won the Americans with 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five gates in two games should actually represent a decent performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember that ever done . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I am not among the people who keep their gates in memory .
&quot; this is what they know , however , the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition , and are equal in their group with the Brit@@ ons in the first place that after its 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
great Britain and the United States will resume their first round on Saturday in the last game .
&quot; both teams have already been qualified for the quarter @-@ finals , the game will decide which the two will gain the first and second place within their group from six teams . &quot;
the first @-@ placed will last a bit longer in the way that the other group will cause .
&quot; as always the game released on Saturday , the Americans have triggered by their success story , four years after she landed in the past London games on the last of 12 places . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years of a Ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ schl@@ äger in hands ( their two older sisters played the sport at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became a National Park of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
&quot; it missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 , since she could not qualify for the Ka@@ der . &quot;
&quot; then came the year 2012 , in which for her and her team went all wrong . &quot;
&quot; in the following year , Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , Trainer of the National Team and the way began to turn things for better . &quot;
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
we did not have the work@@ book in London that we now have .
we can see the rest of the rest of the world .
&quot; on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the door@@ step in the first half of the game with a return attack from the se@@ am area . &quot;
&quot; India was left without victory in the tournament in the game , but the team showed himself surprising and held the game rose from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until B@@ am took the play into their hands . &quot;
&quot; she complet@@ es a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left fl@@ ank , then moved to the middle and hat@@ red to get the ball into the gate around the Americans . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ zal@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the tournament for the go@@ alies of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games . &quot;
she has a run .
just as B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well will depend on Saturday the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline
&quot; wherever you are , how late it is , it is the Olympic Games . &quot;
the events in Rio de Janeiro feel resistant and in@@ es@@ capable of a rapid run @-@ up between competition and effort .
&quot; it is , as if the ol@@ ymp@@ ic tor@@ ch itself was a burning stone , who is protected from w@@ rist@@ watch to the swi@@ mmer for gymn@@ as@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; you can not turn the TV , read a newspaper or listen to the conversation in the queue in the queue in the queue , without over Simone Bal@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ av@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is also Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s warm with di@@ m@@ ples , could possibly have been sent under this known name to be sent to Prime Time , built by sponsors and welfare TV advertising when he would be a swi@@ mmer , tur@@ ner , or even a real . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fighting in ol@@ ymp@@ ic tramp@@ ol@@ ines around Gold . &quot;
the ol@@ ymp@@ ic flame illuminated not every event .
&quot; further from the center , partly in the shade are the sports , which are not generally recognized : bub@@ ble , arch@@ ery , Bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the breast swimming and let it reign for a long time .
&quot; but if I can make modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me direct the attention to the discre@@ te charm of the trampoline . &quot;
&quot; although the trampoline already has been a ol@@ ymp@@ ic event since 2000 , when it had been heard in Sydney , it became the last 16 years so sp@@ in@@ geni@@ ous that many that I asked , did not know that it is at all a Olympi@@ ad art . &quot;
this could also be regional ignor@@ ance .
&quot; although the USA athletes sent to competition , there has never been a medal in the trampoline and until 2012 he had made a athletes who has done it up to the end . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians do tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Can@@ adi@@ ans for women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ on from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
&quot; the trampoline has a certain outdoor play , partly because it sounds for the un@@ clear ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school as the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a rede@@ mp@@ ter enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has hum@@ orous potential - the cart@@ o@@ eing tre@@ m@@ bling of his never to end we@@ aving , but also the Grazie of the turn@@ around and diving , the two sports , which combines it essentially . &quot;
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline as much means as &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot;
&quot; jumping on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( thre@@ w , p@@ genuine and sal@@ tos ) before they land on the feet . &quot;
&quot; it is assessed according to official Olympi@@ ap@@ ro@@ gram after execution , difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; two @-@ thir@@ sty athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio against each other . &quot;
the gener@@ ic ol@@ ymp@@ ic vector is straight .
&quot; hop@@ ed must go ahead in their quest for gold , faster , up and down , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes and back , up and down to the playground . &quot;
&quot; they do not only have the Zi@@ ell@@ in@@ ie or the output wall , but in the television transfer also another image target : the world or the Olympic stadium . &quot;
&quot; the pur@@ pos@@ eful endeav@@ our is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to upgrade even a spect@@ ator to tears . &quot;
but it is also what I feel while looking for this games as a somewhat man@@ age@@ able .
&quot; of this , the trampoline offers a re@@ pri@@ eve . &quot;
the vector of the trampoline is above .
a back@@ wards movement is not the target .
&quot; he or she pr@@ un@@ ted , apparently he@@ el@@ os like a ast@@ ron@@ aut , goes down , then down , then effortlessly back up . &quot;
&quot; there is also a contest , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no h@@ ectic attack on the target , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dreams , elegant removal of time and gravity . &quot;
it can be as Zen as the competition for the Olympic Games only .
&quot; qualification and final women are celebrated on Friday afternoon , in streaming to 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , likewise by 13.00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will shine the ducks as part of a afternoon blocks from 2 days from 14.00 .
&quot; in the midst of Olympia Man@@ ie , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to be over@@ looked in the general tum@@ ult . &quot;
&quot; if the consci@@ ous@@ ing increase can only be achieved by the att@@ age and the rec@@ tification of male athletes , according to The Wall Street Journal recently pre - then Mr Do@@ ol@@ ey awaits us his according to air rin@@ ce , new fan@@ ci@@ ousness . &quot;

violent protest in Ethiopia
prot@@ esters the political changes in Ethiopia calls on violent resistance of the government .
witnesses say that fifty prot@@ ested during the cl@@ ashes with the police were killed in shame .
is Ethiopia just to break up ?
&quot; over the past ten years , it was one of the most stable countries of Africa , a solid association with a fast growing economy . &quot;
&quot; however , in the last few months sh@@ ak@@ eable protests against the government the country and stretches more and more areas . &quot;
last week thousands of people hit the streets and slow@@ ed fundamental political changes .
the response of the government was un@@ mer@@ ci@@ ful by human rights organizations un@@ mer@@ ci@@ ful .
witnesses passed that polic@@ emen were shot in zig un@@ armed prot@@ esters and killed .
&quot; turning the videos about the protests , which are pres@@ um@@ ably seen from the last or beginning of this year , will show how security busin@@ ess@@ men have to beat out , while these were forced to make a hand@@ stand against a wall . &quot;
the Chief of the UN Authority of Human Rights is now demands a closer examination .
&quot; it has always been difficult to keep this country and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project manager of Africa from Africa the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most pop@@ ulous country of Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
&quot; American military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiop@@ ians , to fight counter terrorism over the region , especially in Somalia . only few countries in Africa , if at all , receive so much Western aid . &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian economy expands in a remarkable pace .
his infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new p@@ endant in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
the streets are generally quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even if Ethiopia was anything but an example for democracy - human rights organizations have continuously led the repression of the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted , whereas the presi@@ dents were effective . &quot;
&quot; many were sent into exile or prison , killed or pushed into the desert of the wilderness . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; if you do people supp@@ ress and do not have any other options except to protest , it breaks off , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in Central Ethiop@@ ian . &quot;
the entire youth prot@@ ested .
a generation is prot@@ ested .
there are numerous ail@@ ments that cover everything from the ground floor up to the thro@@ po@@ ise in terms of power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; after a far @-@ reaching election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time the tensions along the border to Erit@@ rea ; a struggle for this z@@ ack@@ ly , contro@@ versi@@ al line called on June hundreds of lives . &quot;
&quot; an@@ alysts are concerned that separ@@ ati@@ sts , like the Oro@@ mo @-@ Liber@@ ation Front or the National Liber@@ ation of the O@@ g@@ aden , which were more or less en@@ forced in recent years , which could benefit turbul@@ ence and re@@ bels . &quot;
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess after years of pre @-@ holes under the surface are now explo@@ ding .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
&quot; only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate with social media , as cheap smartphones have become more frequently and improved the Internet services . &quot;
&quot; even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via internet @-@ pro@@ x@@ ies , which hide , where they are . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians have made that they gathered themselves so much to proteins .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity among the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cs in Ethiopia . &quot;
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; since then , the Am@@ res@@ as made the Am@@ res@@ as , which come from Ä@@ thop@@ ia predomin@@ antly Christian high@@ lands , in politics and economy , while they explo@@ it the Oro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are living and living in flat @-@ regions . &quot;
but also this is changing .
&quot; we are here , under a umbrella to coordinate , said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot;
the biggest protests found in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos , the feeling that Ethiopia domin@@ ates a fair of members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , which are about 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in the military in the intelligence sector , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr Mel@@ es , a former re@@ bel leader , was until his death in a non @-@ nat@@ al disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister . &quot;
&quot; he was seen as a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think of the corners . &quot;
&quot; an@@ alysts are saying that he was especially sealed it was to use early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and special officers , to edit opponents and to make them harmful . &quot;
&quot; the current regime is lacking in this basic skill , &quot; &quot; Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiop@@ ian new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was selected for su@@ aded reasons in order to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; other than Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of North America , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south . &quot;
an@@ alysts are saying that he enjoys not enjoying the confidence of the Tig@@ ray controls .
many fear that the result will be more bloo@@ d@@ shed .
&quot; the last time that Ethiopia was a rebel@@ lion in 2005 , after thousands against elections were prot@@ esters , according to the statements of analy@@ st seemingly from the government and subsequently were st@@ olen . &quot;
&quot; during the following symptoms , many prot@@ esting were killed , even if there were less than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; development experts pra@@ ised Ethiop@@ ian leaders for their vision@@ ary Infra@@ structure planning , such as the new comm@@ iss@@ ors , as well as for their measurable progress in the fight against poverty . &quot;
but obviously this does not have the intensi@@ fication of the internal mis@@ g@@ un@@ st of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and she takes a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; last month of gri@@ ps prot@@ esting in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ an city , by Tig@@ ray @-@ guided shops and the hat@@ red opposite the Tig@@ ray is becoming more and more exercise . &quot;
an@@ alysts are saying that the protests in the USA and other Western allies are based in a peculi@@ ar position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as a base for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over the neighboring Somalia , even though it was recently en@@ ched that it has closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want to merge its allies in a already vol@@ ati@@ le area . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; is a very thin crest . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp explains its statement Obama was founded IS@@ IS &apos; in Sar@@ cas@@ m .
&quot; Donald J. Tru@@ mp tried to dis@@ si@@ ls on Friday the last contro@@ vers@@ y that his campaign began , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would be the &quot; founder &quot; of the terror group of Islamic State , not seriously . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this clari@@ fies new questions about the communication skills of the presidential system of rep@@ ublic@@ ans , whether he will be able to communicate in clear and understandable with the American public . &quot;
&quot; it also brings his compassion that endeav@@ our to take him during a event@@ ful phase in protection , to explain in the peculi@@ ar position , statements that he could not meant at all . &quot;
&quot; after he had made the hint at a campaign event at Mit@@ tw@@ och@@ et , Mr. Tru@@ mp was created with regard to the claim on Thursday and consisted in interviews that he really did not intended to indicate the president and Mrs. Clinton would have made IS@@ IS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday said Mr. Tru@@ mp , he was simply s@@ ark@@ tically . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ we@@ et was the opposition to the previous day , where Mr. Tru@@ mp said in a series of interviews , he said the blame fully seriously . &quot;
&quot; as the conservative Radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator H@@ ugh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tru@@ mp wanted to weak@@ en the statement somewhat weak@@ en that Mr. Obama wants to destroy him , wanted to destroy the Republi@@ can presidential elections . &quot;
the final storm of criticism against Mr. Tru@@ mp down while he tries to direct the focus of his campaign because of falling shift values to the economic situation .
Mr. Tru@@ mp and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Michigan in this week .
on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp tried to return to this topic again .
&quot; on Twitter , he war@@ ned that Mrs. Cl@@ int@@ ons gave proposals to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp has already presented sar@@ cas@@ m to its defence .
&quot; late July he moved strong criticism against himself as he said , the Russians should pack Mrs. Cl@@ int@@ ons E@@ mails , but he later stated &quot; &quot; Nat@@ ür@@ cher , I said the sar@@ cas@@ tically . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tru@@ mp can move the lingu@@ istic boundaries in politics and then push back to demand .
&quot; I think it is one of its methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive , and then if necessary &quot; &quot; depending on how the reaction expi@@ res . &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sh@@ erman , a communication expert , who observed the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I also think he is clever enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough , so that they can be interpreted in a different way . &quot;
&quot; instead of shar@@ pen@@ ed the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tru@@ mp has assumed an even estimated sound since its re@@ fr@@ actu@@ ation continues . &quot;
&quot; a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist who was released on Friday showed a leadership with great lead in the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ on head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tru@@ mp generally tried to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative expression , he frequently acc@@ uses his critics , his statements or fal@@ sely affect his humor . &quot;
&quot; but while being strengthened in the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s Sch@@ er@@ ze have brought his loyal co @-@ workers into the un@@ comfortable situation , to him , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative may also be his statements . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former Mayor of New York and one of Tru@@ mp@@ s prominent inter@@ c@@ essors , gave great effort to defend the candidates today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments &quot; &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani so he was asking for the accuracy of Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s statements , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that Obama IS@@ IS was a almost unknown , small organization , he called it bot@@ her@@ nia , completely false and therefore it happened , because he moved troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most of the ma@@ instream rep@@ ublic@@ ans are trying to ar@@ gue that the government served under Obama , in the Mrs. Clinton as an outer minist@@ erial imag@@ ined , it IS@@ IS allowed to spread out the situation in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; in front of the election campaign in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp continued his attacks on the media and cast them to ride every one of his words and pres@@ et against him . &quot;
&quot; he desp@@ ised the &quot; poor , j@@ un@@ uch &quot; TV experts , who try to understand it and said , &quot; you can &apos;t it ! . &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats mo@@ aning about Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s exc@@ use as only another proof that he is un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
&quot; once more about the price of the market , Café is going back in Green@@ point &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a sh@@ ab@@ big@@ es cafe in William@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi but for 15 years of good coffee . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices from its Bed@@ ford Avenue are pushed to a front . &quot;
&quot; the shop So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , the ver@@ b in the summer of 2014 replaced , s@@ ells so@@ ap in the form of C@@ up@@ cakes . &quot;
indigenous people bet@@ ray it as the last loss in a viable city .
&quot; the artist &quot; Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ ell wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I can still not believe that CB@@ GB dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and ver@@ b now is a so@@ ap . &quot;
&quot; but if New York is change , then it is also new . &quot;
&quot; a reg@@ ain ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similar atmosphere . &quot;
coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing staff of the old cafes , the owner and managing director of the new café . &quot;
he began working in 2001 at Ver@@ b and stayed there until the end .
&quot; when he offered a customer to provide money for a new outdoor place , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , be@@ held a lot . &quot;
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els bought the same es@@ pres@@ so model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old ver@@ b .
&quot; but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he wanted to be experimenting . &quot;
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu is sand@@ wich@@ es with bac@@ on and cheese and there are she@@ ep@@ ages like KA@@ Per@@ n and su@@ mp@@ ed oni@@ ons .
there are natural bow@@ ls .
&quot; the café serves no beer more , but there is fresh juice . &quot;
&quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he noticed a steady flow of old master customers . &quot;
&quot; many old customers were also ur@@ ped by awards from William@@ sburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was a such customer .
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in William@@ sburg and visited the ver@@ b regularly . &quot;
&quot; after she moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way to himself . &quot;
&quot; after the ver@@ b had closed , she gave a while the coffee and she said . &quot;
&quot; I became clear that it was on coffee and on the culture in the ver@@ b , who liked it , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now they drink coffee , even though she introduced a Bl@@ ended C@@ hai Tea at this day instead of their usual oral coff@@ ees , who is another new addition . &quot;
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long @-@ standing company since the beginning of the ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went there before work and ordered in@@ vari@@ ably always the same .
&quot; I came to seven , every day , as a Swiss watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing @-@ Bag@@ el with but@@ ter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said , he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu . &quot;
&quot; nowadays Ros@@ enthal still receives its usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing @-@ Bag@@ el with bac@@ on , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he has no Gro@@ ll about it that the so@@ ap @-@ business had taken the old business room .
&quot; in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie to produce a special so@@ ap for ver@@ b with the cold coffee of the café as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go into their offer , &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional , Polish inhabitants Green@@ points have also accepted the café . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated the menu into the Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he pre@@ ached it soon , so that his new neighbours are welcome . &quot;
the site has also further advantages .
a local Saf@@ t@@ locally wants to fill the col@@ ouring coffee into bottles and sell .
there is a chance that the café is expan@@ dable on a dis@@ advant@@ ageous building .
for many customers there is a new ver@@ b to get their old favourites .
Joseph W@@ itt was stem and said that he was destroyed at the ground as the café closed .
&quot; as the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that they felt like a new coffee and the be@@ ek@@ y of a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; I had to cra@@ w@@ l &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; the primary food of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; an abundant meal &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his rise to the President , Franklin Del@@ ano Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt began his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
as a gour@@ mets did President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt had a Fai@@ ble for refined delicacies of Fifth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water tor@@ tur@@ tle @-@ sauce .
&quot; his menu on this day was something hum@@ den@@ er : filled eggs in Tom@@ at@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , pot@@ ato p@@ ony and as dessert a pl@@ ough . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with the interested people , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans , how they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histor@@ ies .
&quot; last book &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; was of the Chinese food in the US , while Zi@@ egel@@ man told in her book &quot; 97 Orchard &quot; about living in a residential house at the Lower East Side of the Food perspective . &quot;
&quot; their latest cooperation , &quot; A decent meal &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at the Har@@ per Verlag , illustr@@ ates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity , when they meet with a re@@ por@@ ter in the Eisen@@ berg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop to dinner , a small , sn@@ ak@@ y Im@@ bis@@ s at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese with olive piece , while Co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with pot@@ ato p@@ ump@@ y and vegetable @-@ fish . &quot;
&quot; as the re@@ por@@ ter Hack@@ br@@ aten , this found the couple for a discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
there was Erd@@ n@@ uss@@ bro@@ t , liver and B@@ ohn@@ en@@ bro@@ t . &quot;
they were prepared from an ingredient and something Bil@@ li@@ ly prepared for the ingredient .
imagine so many pe@@ anu@@ ts to eat that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ e gr@@ in@@ ste .
&quot; it must have laid in the stomach like B@@ lei , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in recent years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an All @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at @-@ buffet . &quot;
teams of women co@@ aches for male field workers and it was fresh@@ ly baked past@@ ed for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; there were Americans , which sent during the first World War food to star@@ ry Europeans . &quot; &quot; A Square &quot; &quot; stands out the paths that the country was going to be no longer the sm@@ al country . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when eating for Americans was a central , a ten@@ se theme , was buried Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; just as ten@@ se was the new Bud@@ get@@ ing : mysterious foods such as bre@@ ads and bar@@ ser@@ ollen were revi@@ ved as a wonderful way , the cas@@ ser@@ ene as a &quot; wonderful way , me@@ al@@ remains recur@@ ring &quot; , &quot; mer@@ ges Zi@@ egel@@ man , since chefs could hide wei@@ ght@@ ful ingredients under an incre@@ mental sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dr@@ yers .
&quot; meat , which was for years the center of the American cuisine , became a rare luxury . &quot;
&quot; peculi@@ ar mixtures have been tried , since a cal@@ orie and nour@@ ishing satisfaction has priority against taste or even healthy kitchen . &quot;
&quot; during their research for the book , the also recipes includes , prepared goat a dish from that epoch , fried oni@@ ons with pe@@ anu@@ t but@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular supplement on lunch , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ man continues from : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
Erd@@ n@@ uss@@ but@@ ter and fried oni@@ ons do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the household recipes .
&quot; as never before or since then , exagger@@ ated bud@@ dies - including Louise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the eating habits of such people . &quot;
&quot; by offering recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to make &quot; household policy &quot; and the challenge , pamp@@ er like cre@@ m@@ ish sp@@ ag@@ h@@ etti with car@@ r@@ ots into delicious meals to transform . &quot;
&quot; a Square &quot; &quot; is a celebration of historical ti@@ db@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the reports of the response of the government to star@@ ving citizens , like President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cake @-@ attitude . &quot;
&quot; while he is publicly pra@@ ised the simple I@@ owa farmers in the kitchen of his kitchen , he pointed out like the millions of the people of the world to which he has become . &quot;
&quot; he liked continental kitchen as fish with cu@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
he ate in an almost ver@@ plated dining room and carried a smo@@ king .
he was lovely real@@ ign@@ ant .
&quot; President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt could possibly have committed the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had encouraged him to stat@@ u@@ ate his stomach with his stomach . &quot;
&quot; as described in the book , the an@@ alogy of a landlord with no interest in flav@@ ours by Ms. Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt that the White House produced the bo@@ red meal in Washington , but also one of the most delicate . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of Great Depression , to deal with food , was rejected once the country came back on legs . &quot;
&quot; the legacy is on our continued focus on cal@@ ories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as on how science was applied to food . &quot;
the pair gave them better understood in writing the book the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ mans @-@ in @-@ law - for example how to throw foods failed .
&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man rec@@ alled , &quot; &quot; she actually made people sick . &quot;
then there was the wind case .
&quot; after the dish was vac@@ ated at Eisen@@ berg &apos;s , they went and co@@ e made a dessert that they had at home : the pl@@ ough of Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt to noon . &quot;
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une wh@@ ip , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that there was a poor trick , hum@@ ble recipes to send a name . &quot;
&quot; there was no conf@@ isc@@ ated cream , only pl@@ ums , some fl@@ our , sugar , water and c@@ innamon . &quot;
each di@@ pped somewhat rel@@ uc@@ t@@ antly a spo@@ on in the tough , brown gli@@ de . &quot;
surprisingly enough it is not bad .
co@@ e sco@@ red three times a post@@ ure .
&quot; like a can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ zer , he said to his wife , &quot; A few ch@@ opped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
at bom@@ bs attack : he was the hero of Al@@ epp@@ o
he sat down his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed Om@@ ar .
he was the hero of Al@@ epp@@ o : Khal@@ ed Om@@ ar devoted his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old even died with a facade attack of the Assad regime .
&quot; Om@@ ar was a member of the &quot; White Hel@@ mets , &quot; a civilian group , which saved according to Bild @-@ Newspaper for almost 6@@ 0,000 people . &quot;
29@@ 00 Volunte@@ ers put their own lives on the game to educate people from bom@@ bed houses and to make first aid in the war region .
these are the heroes of the war in Syria .
&quot; Om@@ ar was the face of the group : a video of the civil servant , which shows him in a 11 @-@ hour rescue of an aci@@ dity from the ruins of a house , went in 2014 around the world . &quot;
it made the Syri@@ ans for the shining symbol of the Gre@@ ys of the war .
&quot; however his hero has never seen himself , said according to picture : &quot; &quot; for me this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I want to rescue life , I think that God sees me a mart@@ yr . &quot;
&quot; shortly before Om@@ ar himself came to an attack on victim , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b attacks in Syria . &quot;
&quot; hel@@ icopter have raised four façade bom@@ bs over the Alz@@ adia district , one was filled with Ch@@ l@@ org@@ as . &quot;
a woman and two children died ; seven people suffer from breathing .
&quot; we now eliminate the po@@ ison@@ ing remains of the bom@@ b , so that not children are playing them , cited the picture shows his last words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bom@@ b of the Assad had to meet the terrorists .
Gre@@ enland : the oldest sp@@ ends is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
Gre@@ enland @-@ ha@@ y generally occur only in winter to surface finish .
this shar@@ k was allowed to go back to the sea after an examination on board of the S@@ anna &apos;s S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Gre@@ enland get only at 150 years of succession .
&quot; super@@ ficial swi@@ ms the Gre@@ enland at the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour he is on average at 1,@@ 220 feet far . &quot;
&quot; only when it arrives , it speeds up the five meter long animal on s@@ ad 2,@@ 6 km / h - and with this peak speed is half as fast as a robot . &quot;
&quot; this of long lon@@ eliness , however , seems to be a patent for a high age . &quot;
&quot; Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal Science &quot; at least from a Gre@@ enland , the 392 years old . &quot;
&quot; mad@@ ness , commented Alexander Sch@@ eu@@ erl@@ ein from the Max Planck Institute for demo@@ graphic research in Rostock this life span , which means for vert@@ eb@@ row a world appeal . &quot;
&quot; indeed , the evolutionary bi@@ ologist already assumed that Gre@@ enland @-@ ha@@ ie are already seen . &quot;
only lack@@ ed the evidence .
&quot; Gre@@ enland @-@ ha@@ ie are difficult to observe , eventually they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the sk@@ inn@@ ed co@@ asts of Canada , Gre@@ enland , Norway and S@@ val@@ b@@ ard . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees cel@@ sius , they dive at the surface mostly only in winter . &quot;
on the lifestyle of Gre@@ enland researchers know some little .
her Zeit@@ l@@ up@@ emp@@ o Ma@@ issen them when they re@@ plac@@ ements six animals with a transmitter .
&quot; loo@@ t make this shar@@ ks anyway : in the stomach of a beast , researchers found the remains of a Rob@@ be , a different one had swal@@ lowed up a young ic@@ oi@@ ou@@ ling . &quot;
possibly they were sle@@ epy animals or pat@@ ro@@ illi@@ ers at the bottom of the Eis@@ me@@ eres and seek Ka@@ da@@ ver that are from higher water layers down to the tor@@ ches .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues were examined 28 Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Gre@@ enland or S@@ val@@ b@@ ard as a head from the depth of North Atlantic . &quot;
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long while the largest 502 cen@@ timet@@ res .
&quot; to determine the age of the animals , analy@@ zing them with the carbon @-@ 14 method the Lin@@ sen@@ ders of the shar@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the ey@@ eli@@ ds occurs already before the birth of the shar@@ ks , the proteins contained in it will no longer be renewed . &quot;
the two smallest shar@@ ks had a great deal of carbon @-@ 14 in the dun@@ geon .
&quot; your birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s than nuclear weapons , as an atomic carbohydr@@ ate attempt to bring greater quantities of this radio@@ active carbon s into the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in which with 220 cm , the smallest animal contained the Lin@@ sen@@ ders included a small over@@ shot of carbon @-@ 14 from the atomic army , it is likely to have celebrated his 50@@ th birthday in 2012 . &quot;
all major Gr@@ ön@@ land had normal carbon @-@ 14 volumes that arises from cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ watch showed for a 4@@ 93 cen@@ timet@@ res long Gre@@ enland a age of 335 years , while the record @-@ shar@@ k with 502 centimeters may even be 392 years old . &quot;
&quot; that Gre@@ enland @-@ females only then grew , if they are longer than four meters , was known . &quot;
&quot; now , the researchers were able to arrange the length of a age . &quot;
&quot; since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood at the threshold to the sexually mature , and its age was determined with 156 years , Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie with the multip@@ lication apparent at least a half centuries time . &quot;
&quot; also , that is likely to be for wh@@ i@@ als to be world @-@ ch@@ ord . &quot;
&quot; that such meth@@ us@@ ems live above all in cold waters , is no coinci@@ dence . &quot;
&quot; the previous record holder , a 211 years old Gre@@ enland , in whose sp@@ eck of the neck cat@@ ching up a 120 year old Har@@ po@@ en@@ spitze , was captured in Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures often , the organism is also running on as@@ parag@@ us . &quot;
so they mature later - and s@@ add@@ ling s@@ lower .
&quot; in order to warm up in cold water , the animals are also very large . &quot;
&quot; because the volume grows much faster than its surface , by which the animal sho@@ ots heat . &quot;
the heat loss of one gram is therefore much bigger than with an gram elephant .
a further advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives therefore more dangerous and should concentrate on how many descendants have to be seen as early as possible , &quot; explained the evolution of evolution . &quot;
a very large animal on the other hand should invest in a long life on the other hand .
aby@@ ss in the double pack
with themes relating to the building of building the community is focused on the recent session .
&quot; with relief the panel took the message from Mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; finally , the marketing of the most recent @-@ known dormit@@ ories can start . &quot;
&quot; after the fundamental rights , par@@ zel@@ li@@ tigation and event@@ ual questions , the sale of the plots in the residential @-@ areas &quot; &quot; street away &quot; &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( area Bin@@ der@@ straße - Ex@@ tended section 1 ) to prosp@@ ers nothing more in paths . &quot;
the council is convinced that the b@@ lows in rural and quiet residential @-@ community Schön@@ au young families and r@@ üs@@ i@@ ores alike alike .
&quot; as it was , there can be a sign from now on in the City Hall , over the allocation of the plots will likely be advised in its September session . &quot;
&quot; to make requests to the relocation of further commercial firms connected to the creation of jobs , to be decided , decided the council , to change the community plan in part in the spring of this year . &quot;
&quot; thus , in the range of sub @-@ time zones that is already expanded to two plots towards the national road 2@@ 112 . &quot;
Frankfurt profits from Bre@@ x@@ it
&quot; the city at the Main Event also has the best opportunities to attract new jobs and companies in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg . &quot;
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt has benef@@ ited most from the Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the competence field markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is un@@ certain whether money dw@@ ell@@ ings continue to operate from London from financial transactions throughout the EU . &quot;
&quot; so far , for the so @-@ called EU pass , it has so far enough approval in Britain . &quot;
this just use large US @-@ banks .
several banks have already announced jobs to shift jobs .
&quot; the lob@@ b@@ ying , Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; counts with 10000 new jobs on the main road five years . &quot;
&quot; in Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the I@@ W , the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the euro zone , as well as other important authorities as the European insurance company of EI@@ O@@ PA and the risk of the ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) have its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the Not@@ en@@ bank is important for banks , since they can communicate so directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; Luxembourg holds a large fund in Luxembourg , cutting but also like Dublin in the infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the great airport , Frankfurt be much easier to achieve . &quot;
furthermore points the city with slightly available business properties .
&quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; at the Seine , the co @-@ class busin@@ es@@ properties are increased by 50 percent higher than the Main . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life as a competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crimin@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; in a ranking of the consultancy Mer@@ cer , the city is at place seven , Luxembourg on place 19 , Dublin to place 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7. place . &quot;
&quot; even if the quality of life would be a question of preference : &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European Single Market , Frankfurt could also attract further banks and investors . &quot;
&quot; but in spite of Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , I will remain the most important financial centre in Europe , my economic researchers . &quot;
&quot; for this , the forces of forces : in London worked in accordance with numbers of Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba at the end of 2015 around 14@@ 4000 people in the banking sector , in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2500 . &quot;

in a cr@@ ush opposite to this hidden Donald Tru@@ mp hidden behind false speeches and re@@ trac@@ tions in relation to his previous promises to publish its tax @-@ explan@@ ations .
&quot; it is common for U.S. presidential data to release their tax evasion , although they are not obliged to do so by law . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp , a New Yorker &apos;s busin@@ es@@ sman , and his law@@ yers have as reason for its den@@ ial a tax examination by the tax authorities . &quot;
&quot; they are on the train &quot; , &quot; wrote Cl@@ int@@ ons &quot; &quot; Cl@@ int@@ ons &quot; &quot; Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , with regard to the publication of the presidential elections . &quot;

&quot; he ref@@ used to do what every other presidential elections has done in recent decades and publish its tax evasion . &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot;
&quot; police has reported that Tru@@ mp has paid no or very little taxes in the 1990s and an economic value of the New York Times agreed on Friday a series of tax par@@ quet and tax advice , the statements that still may be the case . &quot;
governments have become a subject in the election campaign .
&quot; Clinton supports a regulation that is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and Investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett , who would ensure that people earn more than $ 1 million a tax rate of at least 30 % . &quot;
President Obama also supports the proposal .

Jewish director sh@@ aking Berliner Hotel because Israeli pre @-@ election was removed after &quot; Arabic &quot; call - RT News
&quot; a French director with Jewish roots ent@@ enth@@ used a media record after he had bet@@ ra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli pre @-@ election since it was Arabian guests according to a staff . &quot;
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Hol@@ oc@@ au@@ st@@ documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; &quot; left his hass@@ le at the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by giving an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the country list of the hotels . &quot;
&quot; however , the country was not listed among the countries which can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it in the year 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , is possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ k@@ si Bristol offers a possibility to select Israel over an own call center . &quot;
&quot; after an explanation , the director walked to the hotel &apos;s reception . &quot;
&quot; the answer that he received there , &quot; sho@@ cked him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the Hotel@@ ur@@ asked said that the measure is a &quot; int@@ enti@@ onal decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot;
&quot; the reason , the reason behind it , rede@@ emed in the director even more anger . &quot;
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they asked that the pre @-@ election is deleted , the author of Lanz@@ mann was cited . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli amb@@ assador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ trading n@@ amed this a &quot; great shame &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were horri@@ fied by this event and trou@@ bled .
this is really very sh@@ ame@@ ful .
the fact that this has borne this in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even a still greater shame .
this requires no explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; the right conclusions &quot; , &quot; said the Am@@ t@@ ek . &quot;
the loss proceeds a fairly large reson@@ ance on the internet where people make the whole thing a scan@@ dal .
some signed the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it would have returned to the inn@@ itus of Arab guests .
&quot; ashamed of you , it was mentioned in another post , in which it was pointed out that the hotel is located at the no@@ o@@ ast Kur@@ für@@ sten@@ da@@ mm , close to a synagogue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly became all acc@@ us@@ ations of himself and called the incident an &quot; &quot; bet@@ ray &quot; &quot; and &quot; ap@@ olog@@ ised &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports The mirror . &quot;
&quot; there has never been a direct statement , Israel not to add to the quick@@ y list , quoted the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung a sp@@ okes@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot;
it adds that the country code has been added now .
police sets Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as &amp; Rub@@ ber @-@ fin against prot@@ esters Brazilian students
students participated in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo by police when they gathered themselves to demonstrate against the reforms of the government for the public education system .
the police put Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and Rub@@ ber @-@ fin against the prot@@ esters .
&quot; the difficulties began , as police be@@ am@@ te tried to uph@@ old the students , which led to the police Gum@@ mig@@ esch@@ fin and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as . &quot;
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their beliefs about the plans .
&quot; according to the proposals of the Gover@@ ning Board of the Federal State of Sao Paulo Ger@@ u@@ min , some less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300@@ .000 students will be implemented to save money . &quot;
some of the protest people saw gra@@ ff@@ iti against the preliminary President Michel Tem@@ se on walls .
&quot; the recent protests occurred a few days after demonstr@@ ators in masses on the streets went to support the sus@@ pen@@ ed President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , which had been un@@ vei@@ led by a vote of the Senate on her gradu@@ ation . &quot;
trade between Russia &amp; Iran rises suddenly to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; with the lifting of the sanctions , according to the Russian Ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade fair between Moscow and Teheran in an annual comparison by 7@@ 0,@@ 9 percent . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions imposed on Iran , the interest on Russian enterprises grew strongly in businesses in the country , divided the amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; Russian companies rely on existing connections with Iran , while new companies are willing to gain access to the market . &quot;
&quot; of course , the further merchant is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran &quot; , &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot;
he than@@ ked the trade fair between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 by 7@@ 0.6 percent compared to the same period in 2015 increase and $ 8@@ 56 million .
&quot; in particular , the Russian imports of Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent and bet@@ ra@@ yed $ 697 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the trade @-@ turn was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the amb@@ assador . &quot;
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes out for this year by a record of Iranian tourists in Russia .
&quot; last year the Russian Federation gave rise to around 3@@ 5.000 Vis@@ as , first and foremost by travel ev@@ is@@ as , an Iranian citizen . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Iran reached the top 20 countries that concerns the tourist number in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record @-@ ups will be broken in Russia from the last year , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something that is hop@@ ed by the amb@@ assador that it will change . &quot;
&quot; personally I can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Sh@@ ir@@ az and Y@@ az@@ d recommend the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in a good condition . &quot;
witnesses demanded : beverage
a rob@@ ber@@ y is on Thursday morning at the beverage market from RE@@ WE XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ak@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
&quot; under the maintenance of a sn@@ uss@@ sion demanded three dark dres@@ sed people who had gotten their faces , from the staff of the beverage industry , the issue of cash and fle@@ ed initially at first and then probably with a silver colored VW Golf . &quot;
&quot; how much money was exploited , the police does not share with . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ rators should have been great between 1,60 and mort@@ ality , so relatively small . &quot;
the beverage industry is directly accessible and poor@@ ly visible from the Par@@ deck of the RE@@ WE market .
&quot; the perpet@@ rators must be banned from the over@@ fall towards Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg , and from the opposite of the park @-@ to @-@ house gravel road with the silver @-@ coloured car stops , possibly towards B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) . &quot;
&quot; who made observations on the T@@ atz@@ age ( against 19.@@ 45 p.m. ) observations , which is in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y case , should be in urgent need in the police . &quot;

Sch@@ otte Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ ms home as Br@@ ite Gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ste last night in the male @-@ team Spr@@ int in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to f@@ ame as the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the An@@ chor@@ us , who had made his land@@ sman Sir Chris Ho@@ y . the J@@ umping and made the legend proud when he returned home to win a victory from the favorites New Zealand . &quot;
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory over four years ago while Ho@@ y sco@@ red the fifth of six Olympi@@ ad medals .
&quot; you re@@ peti@@ tive the trick , after being in March at the Rail World Championships in London despite the return Ho@@ ys , only a hum@@ ble sixth place . &quot;
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the employee Jam@@ ie Staff .
they did this in time as a kick @-@ up .
testi@@ s retirement created a gap that K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ ampton tried to close .
&quot; Sk@@ inner was the man , when they remained , when they saw potential in the vill@@ i that has now un@@ folded . &quot;
&quot; Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y triumph@@ ed - and Sk@@ inner continued in the qualification rounds , but in the Stand@@ ing rounds off the New Zealand in the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; Hin@@ gene stood shortly after his turn , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it . &quot;
&quot; a strategy change made a great deal of transformation , when adding to a higher gear to slow it and to hold it Kenn@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to hold the pace . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ y saw from his position as the BBC Expert and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ dus , as those on the po@@ dium . &quot;
the 23 @-@ year Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I am only here to do my best and make me a name .
we have placed a Olympi@@ ad in the middle and defe@@ ats the World Champion .
it was just amazing .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; after the tri@@ umph of 2012 on the side of Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ ge that he fell into the railway after a weak start . &quot;
he returned to this statement later and there was no objection from England Riv@@ alen .
&quot; with such an outstanding victory , this time has no such problem . &quot;
&quot; Hin@@ ge said , &quot; &quot; It feels like the whole GB flags of the tri@@ b@@ une as London . &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
&quot; we have come so badly with so many world @-@ titles , that it was incredible to win back at the Olympi@@ ad . &quot;
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which were seven of 10 titles available in both Beijing and London . &quot;
&quot; if the bar@@ ometer of our advancement in the last five months is , we expect successful five days in the Vel@@ od@@ rom . &quot;
&quot; with the form of passwords , it is in the area of the possible that he has repeated victory of three ol@@ ymp@@ ic gold medals in a contest . &quot;
&quot; this would be born for Kenn@@ y - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was born on 23 March ( a apparently holy date for British sport ; in the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster was born ) - an out@@ flow of six gold medals and a silver medal . &quot;
the cheese of the testi@@ y equal .
Kenn@@ y is next in the Spr@@ int that begins today and will go over three days .
the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels like to gain alone .
&quot; said : &quot; &quot; when he wins two further gold medals , he should be be@@ aten to the k@@ night . &quot;
&quot; it was the only Medal Contest of the day , but there were other good news for England . &quot;
&quot; Sir Br@@ adly Wig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified themselves with the fastest performance in four @-@ four @-@ car races . &quot;
you arrived in 3 : 51,@@ 9@@ 42 at the destination .
&quot; the Wel@@ tre@@ k@@ ord , who won in London in 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1.6@@ 59 . &quot;
&quot; the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) today will be held on the second day of the competition , which Wig@@ gins will be in focus on the second day of the competition . &quot;
he was disp@@ uted yesterday with en@@ voy before the qualification when it cri@@ ed to measure his body size .
&quot; in the proportion@@ ate women &apos;s competition , continued to continue and ended , av@@ anc@@ ed Laura Tr@@ ott , Jo@@ anna Row@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie archive soon of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in World period in 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot;
the GB team leaves itself on his strong rail team to domin@@ ate the middle period of Olympic Games and to pick a sc@@ ary to medals .
after a truly exceptional representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio was down .
&quot; it played Dr@@ amas in the background , so the re@@ sign@@ ation of the technical conductor Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton in April in the midst of Sex@@ is@@ mus@@ - and Mob@@ bing ra@@ iment , as well as retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; however , when one sees itself the first night of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like this would be the legendary reputation GB@@ s who has reached its peak once again . &quot;
the future of the mel@@ ting of Port@@ land due to the removal of the energy contract ques@@ tion@@ able
&quot; the future of the aluminium @-@ mel@@ ts of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ stations of workers - are standing on the game , as the plant operators terminate the energy contract and thus lift all delivery contracts , as the lie@@ remote cable carrier . &quot;
&quot; this step was followed by the government &apos;s decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsi@@ dies to operate the plant . &quot;
one for 20 years of the payout in November is held in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the plant of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are at stake .
no less than 2000 jobs -@@ direct and indirect - could be endangered in a closure .
&quot; in addition , it could come to Domin@@ o@@ effects since the mel@@ ting of approximately 10 per cent of the total electricity generation Vic@@ tori@@ as consum@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Al@@ coa , the Point Henry melt , conducted last year to a closing of the an@@ gler power station . &quot;
the mel@@ ting of al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and ris@@ ky a closing .
&quot; this step follows the years of spec@@ ulations with regard to the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australia dollar and finally due to the current price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which the big aluminum fl@@ ush with his Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley bel@@ ated , shared with that there will be three other owners their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the plant is located primarily in a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company CI@@ TI@@ C and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Corp . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L goes out that the plant in Port@@ land continues to operate , which means an additional physical demand for electricity through the mel@@ ting , divided the company with . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L continues to say that the Tre@@ ats @-@ called &quot; &quot; backup transactions &quot; , &quot; which should have been in force since November 2016 . &quot;
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month period of re@@ vocation period , so that they will end up until 2017 . &quot;
&quot; from this point , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to the revenue , &quot; said the supply supplier . &quot;
all potential impact on the revenue on AG@@ L from G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong termin@@ ations for wholes@@ ale prices .
&quot; AG@@ L told that it has already written the value of the Tre@@ aties in its annual income of $ 187 million in the expect@@ ation of a cancellation . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to choose the contracts , the &quot; capacity of Al@@ co@@ as ... the mel@@ ting to operate or to ensure the power supply to the mel@@ ting &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the U.S. company said that it was completed in 2010 a 20 @-@ year treaty with Lo@@ y Yang , who would have come into force by November this year , even if it is still a statement guilty , why it has come back from the contract . &quot;
an@@ alysts war@@ n due to the bad economic relations of the industry in front of the possible closure of the Port@@ land of Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
&quot; in reference to the statements made by the an@@ alysts at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land consume around 600 meg@@ aw@@ at@@ ts and Tom@@ ago around 900 meg@@ aw@@ at@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; if both plants disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; current market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as a generator manufacturers this would not be good , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; more than just a Car@@ da@@ shi@@ an Reality TV @-@ Star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the sept@@ ember of the Vo@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all J@@ denom@@ in@@ ator , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ ress and mother of the Kar@@ da@@ shi@@ an @-@ J@@ ü@@ s Kr@@ is is on the cover of the cov@@ eted Sept@@ nov@@ ember of the US Vo@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all , the brand amb@@ assador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der is and ran on Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on their inst@@ ag@@ ram account . &quot;
&quot; in a room full of folks that I love , the sight of this coil to the wines , wrote K@@ end@@ all . &quot;
&quot; the un@@ vei@@ ling of the Co@@ vers followed a bizarre ( or just Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ da@@ shi@@ an &apos;s like ? ) , soci@@ alized Reality video , which ends the cover of her sister and ends with a classic turn : you have all planned a surprise party . &quot;
&quot; this presents the clever action nearly every Birth@@ day sep@@ tic in a child@@ r@@ ant back to the set , &quot; you might have forgotten ? &quot; , &quot; with the honest@@ y of a character channel at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is needed to take part in their other girls somehow at this Public@@ ity . &quot;
with a view to the sept@@ ember of the Vo@@ gue with certainty has begun a new era of the Kar@@ da@@ shi@@ an .
&quot; K@@ end@@ alls great sister Kim likes to see what the Vo@@ gue Cover , have been be@@ aten ( she and her husband Kan@@ ye West had been seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the sept@@ ember &apos;s Edition is a League for themselves . &quot;
the sept@@ ember &apos;s Edition is the most sold @-@ selling issue of the year .
&quot; with a circumference , resem@@ bles rather a picture band than a fashion magazine , the output draws a large number of adverti@@ sers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ist@@ a were from the 8@@ 32 pages of the rolling 615 pages advertising ) . &quot;
the un@@ vei@@ ling of his Cover@@ stars is anticipated so longing that in the last two years the magazine are still se@@ ated before the official announcement .
&quot; women who were already on the cover , include Na@@ om@@ i Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ist@@ a and Kate Mos@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; celeb@@ rities , &quot; model@@ ings &quot; as &quot; Models , &quot; the celeb@@ rities &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot;
&quot; Oscar @-@ lau@@ re@@ cip@@ her and Di@@ or brand amb@@ assador J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor . &quot;
&quot; but even at the low chance that Mrs. J@@ denom@@ in@@ ator - that is described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; break @-@ model &quot; &quot; of her generation - among the former category falls , it is in good company . &quot;
&quot; this celeb@@ rities are not related to famous people or Reality Stars or te@@ ens from today , who know how to turn a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if all of it is in common @-@ denom@@ in@@ ator ) . &quot;
they are really talented women who are drawing up in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once published on the last cover had appeared with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of her career .
&quot; of course , J@@ enn@@ ers do not like success for everyone . &quot;
with their Reality TV history J@@ enn@@ ers was always something ten@@ se in the fashion world .
in June cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ ator and her colleague Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d and called it &quot; the Mist@@ ress of the moment . &quot;
these feelings eat up again when the message came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue Cover .
&quot; but on the mis@@ ut , the point seems to be printed on the point . &quot;
K@@ end@@ all J@@ denom@@ in@@ ator is on the cover of the sept@@ ember of the Vo@@ gue .
it is a super model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she works for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer by Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all their sisters sell you pictures of their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
she sold from her done pictures from C@@ indy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to magazine love .
and in their leisure time it is to be seen in the Reality TV . probably just to see their sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
&quot; community centers , every year 16@@ 0.000 people &quot;
&quot; more than 16@@ 0.000 users of the country are ref@@ used annually by the municipal council centres , while the industry accounts for the impact of further up@@ sur@@ ing transactions in the past . &quot;
&quot; in Queens@@ land already three of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , need@@ y people , victims of violence and those who have no means for odd Del@@ o@@ gi@@ vings and similar ones - if you are looking for free legal advice and legal advis@@ es . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the community , which are already overweight and are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; from June next year , this legal centers will lose further 30 percent of their states . &quot;
the director of the municipal base centres of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last collection of the National Association of Community centres revealed that thousands of people are rejected each year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation would be even worse without the abolition of the decision of the Federal Government .
&quot; Queens@@ land coun@@ cils are chron@@ ically under@@ funded what means thousands of people of important services that you need to be ref@@ used , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relationships , people with un@@ man@@ age@@ able and oppressed debts , families that have been dism@@ is@@ sed through divi@@ ding , workers , the un@@ just form of legal nature , and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need . &quot;
&quot; the federal government will be cut by 30 percent in June 2017 , which means thousands of hel@@ pl@@ need@@ y people from Queens@@ land to cope with their legal problems without any assistance . &quot;
&quot; we demand the gener@@ alist attorney and Federal Minister , as well as Sen@@ ators from Queens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to raise these medi@@ ums immediately , so people need help to get them in legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the provincial government met its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance on the national average . &quot;
&quot; it is now at the time to look at the needs of the community centres and their customers , and that the government has invested Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k into this important work . &quot;

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey from countries @-@ elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
&quot; in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , significant losses for the government Party SPD and CD@@ U . &quot;
this is representative @-@ representative of the main research institution IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; Zeitung ( Friday ) . &quot;
&quot; while the red @-@ black government agencies could be ruled in the north shortly afterwards , this is not possible after the re@@ imb@@ urs@@ ement in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both states the SPD would be the strongest party , and thereby had good chances to continue the government . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD fell on 24 percent in five years ago . &quot;
&quot; according to the survey , the party should only be shortly before the CD@@ U , which could come again on 23 percent . &quot;
the third place is disp@@ uted between the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; the left cheese on 19 percent ( previously 18,@@ 4 percent ) , Af@@ D would be present at 19 percent for the first time in the country . &quot;
&quot; the Gre@@ ens , despite easy losses resulting from 6 per cent ( previously 8,@@ 7 percent ) again in the Schwer@@ iner Land@@ tag . &quot;
N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not represent 3 percent in the country each with 3 percent .
&quot; in the case of the Berlin Chamber of Berlin , the SPD members of the pol@@ l are still on 23 percent ( choice 2011 : 28,@@ 3 percent ) . &quot;
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
they saw this even behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) but before the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the or@@ derly house .
&quot; with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pirates would not be missed in contrast to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ mail and internet in time @-@ upe : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator came to the market .
the successor today domin@@ ating the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the unit weigh@@ ed nearly a hal@@ low kil@@ ograms and was more than vi@@ erm@@ al as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was th@@ icker and bigger , it was therefore not good in the hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was rather fl@@ edged . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in memory was initially eight meg@@ aby@@ tes , which today would suff@@ ice for about two sel@@ fish with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gig@@ abyte .
&quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; was just 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , in the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few euros lovers the devices can buy the equipment on the internet , but they come somehow from the number of boarding age . &quot;
but 20 years ago the Communic@@ ator was a sensation .
&quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturers had announced the product a few months previously on the Computer trade fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover as &quot; &quot; office in the West@@ ent@@ asch@@ katze format . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , also by fax was the Communic@@ ator to achieve . &quot;
even access to web pages was possible via HTML @-@ browser if even agon@@ izing slow .
a pocket calcul@@ ators was available to a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
&quot; there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be edited similar to a laptop . &quot;
then a small keyboard and a black @-@ white screen found .
&quot; rather proud , the price : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , thus about 1400 euros . &quot;
the average price of a smartphone in Germany was at 392 euro .
nobody was able to communicate in August 1996 that the Communic@@ ator of the beginning of the smartphone would become an era .
since then everything is different .
&quot; smart phones are a success story , if not for Nokia . &quot;
&quot; the cell division of the fin@@ s lived an un@@ preced@@ ented disaster , was finally sold to Microsoft and handled . &quot;
the market today master providers that came all much later than Nokia .
always and everywhere be online today is for very many people everyday life .
2015 there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
&quot; sold about 1,@@ 4 billion devices , on Samsung and Apple are alone 555 million pieces . &quot;
global sales with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
&quot; to this end , the well @-@ running shops of the pay@@ less App @-@ providers and the telecommunications agency . &quot;
around the smartphone has now developed an entire industry .
&quot; the decisive breakthrough to the mass market was only at the beginning of 2007 , then Apple leader Steve Jobs announced on the Mac @-@ World introducing the i@@ Ph@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; he spoke three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an internet communication , everything via touch screen easy to use . &quot;
&quot; today , the iPhone started by Apple today is the iPhone is the most important product of the Group . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market had seen . &quot;
they finally disappeared to fight Black@@ berry .
the se@@ agen now have Apple and Asian providers such as Samsung .
the smartphone is 20 years after its invention a course of course .
&quot; in the cut , every German now looks 88 times a day on its mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; we must all learn to take the smartphone also away , &quot; said just Jan@@ ina sphere , in the Siemens Board of Directors . &quot;
permanent availability is now valid as a cur@@ se and blessing at the same time .
England must direct and expand the Olympic spirit
you will not only be Heathrow only in our local communities and throughout London but throughout the country renewal and prosperity .
&quot; for me , the biggest attraction of He@@ thro@@ ws dar , just as at that time in 2012 in London , when we take a great effort to ensure that all of our nations and regions benef@@ ited from the games . &quot;
the Olympi@@ ad brought great advantages for Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and we will achieve this again by creating new possibilities for local residents and companies .
&quot; for our local communities , we are alone to create 10,000 new teachers , 40.@@ 000 new jobs and the youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead of London in 2012 , there will be such that the challenge of enlargement He@@ thro@@ ws is too large . &quot;
I told me that England never will be ready for the games and that we will blo@@ ating ourselves on the world stage .
the two @-@ fl@@ aw had 2012 inj@@ ustice and they will also be wrong with Heathrow .
&quot; there are always obstacles to overcoming , but Heathrow answers all the question asked . &quot;
how the Olympic Games is Heathrow for many and not for individual structure project .
extension is a way to create up to 18@@ 0.000 new jobs to create £ 211 billion of wit@@ ting growth and to leave a legacy of skills and jobs both at the airport and in the whole of the UK .
&quot; we have made a great team in Heathrow , which has been implemented a £ 11 billion most expensive net investment program in time and budget , from T5 - the five years in a row of the world &apos;s best airport transfer to T2 , which was built in the middle of two frequencies @-@ testing st@@ rolling around the world . &quot;
now they are ready to deliver a third track record what is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
&quot; the London Games of 2012 were a great success for the UK , and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one . &quot;
&quot; it is time that we will bro@@ aden these ol@@ ymp@@ ic spirit and to bro@@ aden our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment , which can be proud of the England . &quot;

&quot; Ad@@ Block Plus , Facebook in &quot; K@@ atz and mouse game &quot; regarding display recorder
&quot; for companies that make money with Onlin@@ e@@ wer@@ mo Money come according to one of the software developers , adverti@@ sers , a &quot; rubber and mouse game &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that there would be adverti@@ sed on his Des@@ kt@@ op@@ site , published Ad@@ block Plus a b@@ log@@ post in which it allows users to upgrade their filters in the program to block advertising in the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday we shared with that his Des@@ kt@@ op@@ site would change the en@@ coding of his advertisements regarding his advertisements , in order to detect the display of the site , which part of the site advertising is to complain . &quot;
yet Ad@@ block pro@@ claim that it has found a new way to handle the new codes .
&quot; in a log@@ post the speaker was written by Ad@@ block Ben Williams , that &quot; &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ H@@ er struggle between the indicator @-@ temp@@ ting Open Source Community and the conver@@ sions have been underway since the invention of ad temp@@ ting , and that it is possible that Facebook soon comes with a new solution . &quot;
&quot; the fact that the world &apos;s largest company has om@@ itted to the fight for social media has become a strong indicator , as wor@@ rying ad li@@ qu@@ eur for the industry . &quot;
&quot; according to a study conducted from the last year of Pag@@ ef@@ air and Adobe around 200 million people ad lib , almost vi@@ erm@@ al so much 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 26 billion daily active users , who access Facebook about their mobile devices , makes hand@@ y@@ ad 84 per cent of adverti@@ sers Fac@@ ebooks . &quot;
&quot; the company has an adverti@@ sers on desktop PCs aside , since mobile advertising lock do not have effect on Fac@@ ebooks mobile app for the social network and inst@@ ag@@ ram , shared a speaker . &quot;
&quot; advertisement on desktop PCs makes a sufficient amount of revenue , so that Facebook appears to be the investment of such stri@@ de as re@@ warding . &quot;
on Tuesday Facebook shared with that it would be possible to update the &quot; ad em@@ en@@ ep@@ ool &quot; to the people more control over them .
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook , that Ad@@ blocks would be wor@@ rying new filters , because they would also block content on the side who are no advertising . &quot;
&quot; for the users this is not a positive experience , therefore we plan to address the problem , shared a speaker by Facebook in an e @-@ mail message . &quot;
&quot; adverti@@ sers are a bl@@ unt means , which is why we have concentrated on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences , to put more control over the hands of the people . &quot;
woman at susp@@ ected su@@ icide on Swiss motorway
the victim was in the middle of the night on the motorway .
the police gets witnesses to witness after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday at an assumed su@@ icide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the Canton of Wa@@ aud shortly after midnight .
&quot; a woman laid down in the dark , &quot; in an act of desp@@ air , &quot; on the street and were made by several cars , the police in V@@ aud said . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a swe@@ eping at the age of 49 years , which was caused by several vehicles , including a truck , to kill itself . &quot;
it still died on site .
&quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some are still not identified yet , the police , these as well as every witness of the incident to be un@@ resolved . &quot;
&quot; it was opened a negotiation process , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , told G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter the Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gene@@ ve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed . &quot;
was a cl@@ ash avo@@ d@@ able ?
&quot; that is something of the prosec@@ ut@@ or needs to decide , &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the driver will not be held accountable .
in each of the two cases - when a person ran in the Dark On@@ es on the motorway - was decided that motor@@ ists do not need to assume that a pedestrian on the middle of the night runs on the highway as it was in the newspaper .
&quot; last year , a polic@@ eman of the gross@@ est killing has been released , after they had handed over a man and killed that in August 2014 one night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne lay . &quot;
the 22 @-@ year victims had dr@@ unk and has become conscious on the road that took the court .
&quot; the Court introduced that the polic@@ eman -- which had responded to an emergency call -- on an justified manner and that the presence of a man on the road had an &apos; completely unusual and un@@ fores@@ ee@@ able situation &quot; , &quot; said the judge . &quot;
&quot; everyone who has more information on the incident occurring on Thursday near Morges , should be in the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 . &quot;
NASA Kli@@ mam@@ o@@ dell : Venus was once inhabit@@ able
Venus was probably habit@@ able according to the proj@@ ections of a new NASA climate mod@@ ells .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that resem@@ bles both climate research .
&quot; the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could once recorded with their hot , waterproof surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere once er@@ ected . &quot;
scientists have previously pointed out that the slow turn of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have a thin , sublime @-@ like atmosphere and yet slowly turned slowly . &quot;
the model also illumin@@ ate the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet suppos@@ edly dism@@ is@@ sed more dry areas than de earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to live life and even more quickly . &quot;
early Venus benef@@ ited also from a sun that was 30 percent .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow turn of Venus is exp@@ elled their Tag@@ ess@@ ful of the sun almost two months long , &quot; said G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this warm@@ ed the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds , which affects the surface of much of the sun@@ bathing . &quot;
&quot; the result is average @-@ temperatures , which are some degree of cooler than that of the earth today . &quot;
&quot; the model brought forth a history of Venus that resem@@ bles evolution , which was raised by Planet@@ en@@ gene@@ ern . &quot;
&quot; although they were probably inhabit@@ able , Venus -- was exposed in the course of several billion years - much heat and ultr@@ avi@@ olet light . &quot;
their oceans bet@@ ra@@ yed and her water@@ da@@ mp@@ f was bor@@ row@@ ed from the ultr@@ avi@@ olet light .
&quot; when you turned Hydro@@ gen , it only remained a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know them today . &quot;
the researchers divided the results of their new Venus Cli@@ mam@@ od@@ ells at Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .

Ke@@ pler has a rotation rate of stars in the constell@@ ation of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Wel@@ sh teles@@ cope has helped the complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the star @-@ up of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades .
&quot; the new data will help to understand the astronom@@ ers , why stars in constell@@ ation were at different r@@ ams , as well as in which context the rotation periods are standing with the planet . &quot;
&quot; we hope that we read through the compar@@ isons of our results with other constell@@ ation , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Luisa Re@@ ull , a resear@@ cher on the Cal@@ Tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the constell@@ ation of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades lies 445 light @-@ years from the earth .
&quot; many stars were created in this constell@@ ation that emerged about 125 million years ago , now the adult . &quot;
it is now turning at the fastest .
to top @-@ rates run this strip @-@ star large amounts of constell@@ ation .
&quot; since these win@@ ch travel through the magnetic fields of stars , they have a bre@@ d effect on the stars . &quot;
if a star altern@@ ate starts his rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of every star by recogni@@ zing the time between the appearance of a recogni@@ zable star@@ ch@@ equ@@ es -- as sun@@ spots .
the latest catalogue of Rot@@ ation rates points out that there are massive star s@@ lower than less massive stars .
&quot; re@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with greater stars s@@ lower pi@@ rou@@ chains , as smaller . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors will tend to be massi@@ vely against quicker rot@@ ors to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; as the constell@@ ation of Pl@@ ei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare for stell@@ ar qualities as red rates . &quot;
&quot; the constell@@ ation of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rot@@ ation in both directions , younger and older &quot; , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; it is still much ahead of us what we would like to know more about how the How , When and why stars are called down their rotation rates and called &quot; &quot; dance gloves &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Reb@@ ull and their colleagues have reported in three times report in detail about their latest analysis of the rot@@ ational rates of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades , which will soon appear in the Astr@@ onom@@ ical Journal . &quot;
an contro@@ versi@@ al Bas@@ eball @-@ Star starting from

&quot; according to his emotional return announcement , the 41 year old professional will take on 12 August against the Tampa Bay R@@ ays , last time the Tri@@ k@@ ot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &quot; Good@@ bye &quot; , &quot; said the 14 @-@ Mal@@ te All @-@ Star @-@ Game participants of Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez voted for the most valuable player of the League , in 2009 he won the Yan@@ ke@@ es the World Series . &quot;
his signature under a tenth year deal has been rated to him annually 27 million US dollars .
&quot; by the end of contrast on 31 December 2017 , he will be in future as advisor and youth - at full content . &quot;
as a player there are Rodri@@ gu@@ ez long time with performance .

after a legal dispute the sperm was reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; the League could even have done a favor for 2014 , for I have played 20 years without a break , said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez at that time . &quot;
also his far@@ ewell days do not pass in@@ no@@ cent .

Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first place .
&quot; caught : due to a positive di@@ op@@ ing@@ test , wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter may not start the weight of wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter or Poland in Rio . &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 will be over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by the first official d@@ op@@ ing@@ cases .
a s@@ wis@@ er ath@@ l@@ ete could have gained almost a medal .
&quot; prior to the seventh race day , the first official d@@ op@@ ing@@ es became known as the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese swim@@ wear in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter barriers from Bulgaria and Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positive in Brazil and excluded - directly before the beginning of the anyway critical lightweight Ath@@ le@@ tics competitions come through this news . &quot;
&quot; while Ch@@ en has been proven the Di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ d last Sunday , which is used as a mas@@ quer@@ ading means for dop@@ amine substances . &quot;
the International Sport@@ For@@ shof CAS confirmed on Friday afternoon local time for the exclusion of the Olympic Games .
&quot; on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took the fourth place in the finale over 100 m butter@@ fly , just around 0.@@ 09 seconds they missed the bronze . &quot;
on Friday I would have to participate in the fo@@ oth@@ ills over 50 m Fre@@ est@@ l .
Ch@@ en has filed with the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) opening up the B @-@ Test and a hearing .
&quot; the national association should take the matter very seriously and demands from Ch@@ en full cooperation in exam@@ inations , &quot; &quot; X@@ in@@ hua from a statement : &quot; &quot; we will work together with the International Sport@@ Tribunal for the Court and will accept the judgment . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history is no longer responsible for the IO@@ C , but the CAS for the sanctuary of athletes with positive cases . &quot;
also at night of Rio oo@@ ed the message over the positive rehear@@ sal near Dan@@ ek@@ ova by the 33 @-@ year @-@ olds ran into the offensive .
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this was &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; she said the Bulgarian TV channel B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; they be in@@ no@@ cent , &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements &quot; , &quot; explained the ath@@ l@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , it is said that the substance of the EP@@ O can be found in the ver@@ itable substance . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ owa was pro@@ visional suspended , according to B@@ NT should also be enjoyed the B @-@ test already positive . &quot;
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ w immediately agreed with critic@@ isms of the ath@@ l@@ ete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes do not pull the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; we are under observation , so many are already excluded . &quot;
&quot; so , about all weights from the chron@@ ically @-@ consuming nation could not take part in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the case of &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; known as well as 85 kg was tested as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z three days before positive to the an@@ ab@@ ole ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon . &quot;
&quot; both steps are taking , both are not allowed in the class to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; before the start of the ath@@ l@@ ete , Dan@@ ek@@ owa is a further difficult blow to the reputation of the entire sport . &quot;
&quot; the World Association I@@ A@@ AF had the complete Russian team until an exception because of systematic d@@ op@@ ings , the beginning is prohibited , even the L@@ äu@@ er Kenya in Rio has numerous bad news . &quot;
in the swimming sport we also had the earlier clubs in China for fier@@ ce disputes between the athletes .
so handle the Fr@@ ench@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t the Chinese Olympi@@ asi@@ es Sun Yang har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ elt , li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; if I see the po@@ dium over 200 m Fre@@ est@@ l , I will commit myself , &quot; said Lac@@ to@@ t in French Radio . &quot;
sun also stood at the centre of a discussion with the Austr@@ ali@@ er M@@ ack hor@@ ton .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for mental che@@ aters , &quot; said this . &quot;
sun was positive in 2014 at the Chinese master@@ ing positive to the stim@@ ul@@ ant tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but had to sit down only a three @-@ month spar@@ row . &quot;
Dat@@ t@@ au : so per@@ fi@@ de guns h@@ ackers have a ran@@ som
programmers of corruption m@@ alware currently rely on companies and are successful .
&quot; according to a recent survey of m@@ alware experts Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes , among 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany 40 percent of the sur@@ vey@@ ed companies were at least once , partly several times of attack with Er@@ pres@@ ser software . &quot;
in Germany nearly 20 percent of companies already were the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware ext@@ or@@ tion .
40 percent of the victims should be demanded by the perpet@@ rators of the perpet@@ rators of the challenged systems and data in order to use the challenged systems and data .
the perpet@@ rators speci@@ alize their re@@ pres@@ ser software according to the observations of mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes to attack in attacks in the company networks .
&quot; in this case , they are successful , the potentially result of dro@@ pping ran@@ som is clearly higher than with private users . &quot;
&quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying fast evolution of damage , &quot; &quot; Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes &apos;s Chef Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ecz@@ yn@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot; &quot;
in 2008 most mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to send advertising .
then we discovered the perpet@@ r@@ ator software for themselves .
&quot; only then private user had the goal , but the change came to company attacks in the past few months . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware actively work after a simple pattern : once on the computer of an o@@ pf@@ ers , she seeks targeted after un@@ long changed files like Word@@ - , ex@@ cel@@ - or database files as well as to archives of images and videos . &quot;
these files en@@ coding the ran@@ som@@ ware and delet@@ es the origin@@ als .
&quot; subsequently , the software presents the demands of the pres@@ pres@@ ser . &quot;
&quot; to get the end turn@@ key code to the files , the victims need money - mostly in the form of Cryp@@ tow@@ ering Bit@@ coin . &quot;
&quot; however , where private users use the personal photo database on the game , it is with companies about sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production is shut @-@ down . &quot;
accordingly higher the damage falls off when a ran@@ som@@ ware fails .
&quot; 22 percent of the affected German firms affected by Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to under@@ break the operation , in case of a case people were living in life . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , several hospitals were victims of attacks , whose patients can be threatened by loss of sick@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; we say the victims always : pays not , it only promotes the problem , &quot; explained Kl@@ ecz@@ yn@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay , get their data again . &quot;
for managers it is difficult to reject and reject the demands of the perpet@@ rators .
the h@@ acker again know this and try to build a good reputation .
in a recent study the security researchers have been studied from F @-@ secure the utility surfaces and contact with the investig@@ ators and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to establish a kind of customer service to take more money .
&quot; you declare your victims via chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , freely accessible support websites , or de@@ cryp@@ t example files . &quot;
&quot; and they will redeem individuals after payments of few hund@@ red@@ t euros , companies need to negotiate tough and five hundred sums up to get back their data un@@ coded . &quot;
&quot; given the potentially high and relatively risk of profits from the ran@@ som@@ ware ext@@ or@@ tion , the h@@ ackers are becoming more professional and share the work , explains safety exper@@ i@@ ni@@ ewski from Anti@@ virus provider Sophos : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware about within a week . &quot;
prob@@ able it is however that it is about three or four people .
the programmer sell their contam@@ ination then in the form of a software construction to the actual pres@@ ser .
&quot; the previous m@@ alware kits emerged by the m@@ alware itself , consulting and additional tools for a single , firm price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; delivery includes a adaptation tool , so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ewski . &quot;
the presses are then looking for further h@@ ackers to spread the fresh software among the victims .
we are living in a service sector .
&quot; so you are logged in one of the forums in the underground , purchases the set of a criminal , and commissioned a further way to install the software on as many PCs as possible . &quot;
the payment is made per ann@@ ot@@ ized computer .
&quot; usually applied the crimin@@ als then sp@@ amm@@ ers with the distribution , &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ewski . &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that make their data better .
over 50 percent of companies in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes pol@@ l trust in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes pol@@ l rely on boo@@ sting a ran@@ som@@ ware using file back @-@ ups and sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are already pursu@@ ing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if the encryption of data alone does not represent sufficient threat to successful measurement , dro@@ pping the perpet@@ r@@ ator instead with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing &quot; , &quot; explains Mal@@ u@@ eb@@ y@@ tes &apos;s Chef Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ecz@@ yn@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; thus , the damage potential for the type of data is still a lot higher than before . &quot;
&quot; in future , the perpet@@ rators of the future could take completely new goals on the internet of things . &quot;
&quot; on the Hack@@ ard Conference Def@@ con demonstrates security for@@ scher , as they could get a connected thermo@@ stat under their control . &quot;
in the middle of winter the activation of such a mol@@ ded He@@ ating He@@ ast could not be a solvent @-@ eld .
&quot; if the perpet@@ rators , instead of the heating in the future block a whole production line in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a theme in the Industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and powerful .
&quot; in the small HR @-@ V Honda , Honda wants to pack everything : a little s@@ UV , a little cou@@ p@@ é and also the versatility of a mini@@ v@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; it sounds pretty over@@ load , but the HR @-@ V that was constructed on the same new platform like the new Jazz , proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the only 1.60 m high HR @-@ V seems rather small , the passengers have a lot in the first row and in the catch a lot of space , it works in no place close . &quot;
&quot; the materials of the interior are well finished and seem pleasant , only the cock@@ pit @-@ upper side falls somewhat . &quot;
versatile as comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V in the storage box .
&quot; there is not only a trunk area of 453 l at high @-@ placed and 10@@ 26 l when used back @-@ out back , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot;
&quot; this is less magical as it sounds : the sitting areas of the back bank can be heated up like Kin@@ os@@ essel and therefore offer storage space , which is up to a height of 1.9 m high . &quot;
&quot; the trunk can be well loaded , but the charging height with 650 mm is slightly higher than with the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
the tested 1.6 @-@ l diesel with 88 kW / 120 HP speeds up the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges very powerful .
&quot; however , he is likely to judge his work somewhat empty . &quot;
pleas@@ ing is the all @-@ day consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km .
there is still another motor@@ ization : a 1.5 @-@ l petrol gas@@ oline with 96 kW / 130 HP .
a motor drive is not offered .
&quot; driving is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot;
the steering is likely to be a little direct .
the equipment can be opened in the tested top @-@ variant &quot; executive &quot; no wishes .
&quot; to the security systems , the City Not@@ bre@@ ms@@ wiz@@ ard ( works up to Tempo 32 ) , the coll@@ ision system and the trace driver assistance . &quot;
&quot; the coll@@ ision war@@ ns sometimes , because it evalu@@ ates many obstacles as &quot; her@@ edit@@ ary objects &quot; . &quot; &quot;
very reliable works by the remote wiz@@ ard .
and the intelligent Tem@@ po@@ re@@ gler is responding to the road detection and dro@@ w@@ selt when needed the speed .
&quot; but the full connectivity is only for the top @-@ equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , App @-@ Integration and more . &quot;
two US@@ B@@ - and an HDMI socket lie under the arm@@ rest and therefore are some aw@@ k@@ ward to achieve .
the approximately 29@@ 000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped top @-@ diesel are in order .
&quot; who wants to invest not so much will receive the gas@@ oline from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 Euro . &quot;
the engines meet the Euro @-@ 6 @-@ gas standard .
with HR @-@ V offers Honda a versatile and non @-@ day car .
Air@@ line is not liable : overthrow on passengers
an Air@@ line is not liable for the fall of a Pass@@ agi@@ ers on the passenger bridge .
&quot; a liability is conceivable only in danger , which are typical of air transport , arg@@ um@@ ed the Ober@@ land@@ in Court of Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) . &quot;
the r@@ ack@@ et had broken with a knee br@@ ace .
&quot; however , the accident could have happen everywhere - it is a general risk of life , so the court . &quot;
the airline had no damages to the man .
disease : when paid the organis@@ er
&quot; dise@@ ased ho@@ liday@@ makers get back after their journey only then cash back , if the cause of the disease is du@@ cts free in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; however , this is only the case when more than ten percent of guests have proven the same symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in the fall was a family on the second day of her Turkish , hard to diar@@ rhe@@ a and break @-@ breaking . &quot;
it nearly spent the whole vacation in the room .
their disease led the ho@@ liday@@ makers on a def@@ ective br@@ aces that suppos@@ edly had poll@@ uted the sea@@ water .
the family was the view that he had been uns@@ atis@@ fied - and def@@ endants against the organizer .
in court the applic@@ ant had no success .
although the law@@ ns was indeed def@@ ective .
but the organizer came only shortly before leaving the r@@ ack@@ et .
he had to run until then that the sea@@ water was fine .
&quot; so he did not hurt his information , so the judgment . &quot;
especially in the samples of water no contam@@ ination were found .
the condition of several hotel guests - possibly through cont@@ agi@@ ous among themselves - belong to the general nature of life .
from 6@@ 91 guests only 38 erk@@ ill .
&quot; de Ma@@ izi ère said , according to the susp@@ ected violence in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July have had many people of concern for further attacks . &quot;
the state flew and decided to respond to terrorism at the same time .
for sure : our country will not answer the violence of the perpet@@ rators with hate and spl@@ itting .
&quot; these tri@@ umph , we will not give the terrorists . &quot;
&quot; if criminal attor@@ neys would have to leave the country , it increase safety and power as well as the approval of the population for refuge@@ e policy . &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ere wants to achieve a implementation of the proposals until the Bundestag in 2017 .
&quot; he also announced another personalized rein@@ forcement of security forces , and in medium @-@ sized scale order over several years . &quot;
sympath@@ iz@@ ers for terrorism should be under punishment again .
&quot; video surveillance is to be improved , the weapon must be so re@@ defining , that above all the purchase of weapons is created on the internet . &quot;
the last much discussed silence @-@ light for doctors should remain arous@@ ed to de Ma@@ izi@@ ères words .
&quot; however , he wants to search for solutions in dialogue with the sle@@ eves according to solutions , as the threat of the citizens can be reduced , he said with a look at about psychological views . &quot;
&quot; in order to counter@@ act radi@@ alization of refugees , the Minister considers a better social care necessary . &quot;
teachers would have to be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mati@@ sed people .
&quot; to the persecution of crimin@@ als in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , Ma@@ izi@@ ère is planning the use of investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; SPD Chief Gabriel said , &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to the safety . &quot;
it is important that the Minister of Minister clearly has spoken against action .
&quot; this was a ear@@ piece for the hin@@ ge in the CD@@ U / C@@ SU , &quot; Gabriel told the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Medi@@ con@@ group ( Friday ) . &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had rejected Ru@@ ins from the Union to a Bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of double nationality .
a general ban on counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing can be un@@ problematic in constitutional .

better traffic flow on the motorway
at a regular basis there is a picture of the or@@ atory road - here is a picture of November .
&quot; however , this should change : the right to be extended . &quot;
this is good news for all the car &apos;s drivers who stand in the professional traffic on the ambient road every evening in St@@ au when they drive over the motorway from Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
&quot; road construction is extended on the coming Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the hammer road and the exit Wes@@ eler street the right @-@ level track for 700 meters . &quot;
drivers can then move directly from the hammer road to the right .
&quot; the big advantage : the traffic is due to the early stage , thus increasing the overall performance of the federal road 51 on the widely sold section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 . &quot;
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U fac@@ tion in the districts of the representation of Münster @-@ West .
driving on the fe@@ eder transfer on the fe@@ eder the drivers mainly between 5 and 7 PM .
&quot; week@@ days ranges from back to bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her path , and sometimes even beyond . &quot;
reason is the needle watch on the B 51 short before the exit Wes@@ eler street .
from here the traffic is only reduced about the motorway bridge .
the second trace had to be returned to three years ago .
&quot; the reason : static calculations made that the bridge is no longer the required load @-@ force , in order to accommodate above all heavy @-@ duty traffic @-@ bil@@ ing@@ ual . &quot;
&quot; as long as this Eng@@ pass and the connected ste@@ al momentum , the representative office cannot say . &quot;
&quot; however , with years to count : for the bridge has an official rest period up to the year 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the legal capital , the state is aware of the traffic @-@ weak@@ est time in the school holidays , because with disabilities to be reck@@ oned . &quot;
the traffic is passed on Tuesday and on Wednesday at the construction site .
intercultural journey : cultural offerings for schools
the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the theater piece &quot; The In@@ visible House . &quot;
the Club N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theatre are now planning a music project .
&quot; the association N@@ ima &apos;s offers young people with mig@@ rant workers and refuge@@ e background , cultural institutions in Münster , Germany . &quot;
the &quot; class International &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Kinder@@ haus has visited the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; The In@@ visible House &quot; of the Young Theatre Münster . &quot;
in the context of the association N@@ ima &apos;s initiated &quot; Inter@@ cultural journey &quot; we visited 19 students between eleven and 15 years the st@@ aging in the little house .
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association dedicated to the cultural integration of young people with migration and refuge@@ e background , schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster within the framework of this project . &quot;
&quot; most of the youth of the class were born between September 2015 and March 2016 among other things from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Münster , and bore little German . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the cho@@ reography , the scenic images and video animations be it possible to follow the action on nevertheless , so the press release of the young theatre . &quot;
&quot; the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg from Spr@@ int , and the Young Theatre will work in the coming season as part of a musical theatre project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December , young people with and without borders and a migration background of 14 and 20 years have received the opportunity to visit professionally in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music . &quot;
special offers for children and families in the field of theater and the@@ atri@@ cal language study are planning .

rain instead of star@@ ring : hope of we@@ ather@@ ing

&quot; the night was not suitable for clouds and rain , the heavenly spectacle to watch , said the chairman of the observ@@ atory World , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Fri@@ day@@ tomorrow . &quot;
our hope is on the night for Saturday .
&quot; the weather is meant to be good , then we will definitely see many star@@ ters in the sky . &quot;
&quot; these star@@ ches are pers@@ ones who belong to the fastest ast@@ ray with 216@@ 000 kilometers per hour . &quot;
&quot; they have their names , because they seem to come out of the constell@@ ation Per@@ se@@ us , which is in the north @-@ east . &quot;
relaxing night : tips against ins@@ om@@ nia
&quot; in the evening , one is eternal , at night it is un@@ th@@ ink@@ able , in the morning it is far ahead of w@@ eck@@ er@@ ing@@ ing no longer in sleep . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; after all , it is possible with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adult sleeping disorders and more than ten percent emp@@ ow@@ ers their sleep often or permanently as not rest@@ ful . &quot;
how to express sleep problems or ins@@ om@@ nia ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleeping disorders , and there are many causes behind them , stres@@ ses Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eger , Head of the German Society of Applied Research and Medicine . &quot;
&quot; what one understands here , but is the in@@ som@@ nie , therefore an in@@ let and as@@ leep . &quot;
&quot; especially the as@@ leep emp@@ ow@@ sing many people as uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , Head of the German House Association association with practice in Lower Sax@@ on Var@@ el . &quot;
what is behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of sleeping disorders are complex .
&quot; behind , organic , psych@@ ic or conc@@ eptions @-@ related factors , but also medicines are stuck . &quot;
not rarely is the dis@@ rup@@ tible expression of another disease .
&quot; very early aw@@ aking is especially with depression often , &quot; says We@@ eks . &quot;
and it can be that different factors act .
&quot; who has for example has a stre@@ et@@ ching loss , can be bad , w@@ acht every two to three hours , and then bl@@ ur@@ ry , over all @-@ day problems and -@@ care about gr@@ ading , there is an example . &quot;
&quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
when should one deal with sleeping disorders in the doctor ?
&quot; who is not well as@@ leep over a period of one month at least three nights a week and is affected by the day , should go to the doctor . &quot;
&quot; the imp@@ air@@ ment can look completely different : one is ab@@ normal , tired , un@@ re@@ tired , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easily accessible , has voting fluctu@@ ations or bodily complaints such as stomach or he@@ ada@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; to all@@ evi@@ ate the sleeping @-@ compul@@ sive disorder , it is important to find the causes . &quot;
&quot; as a treatment options , among other things , behavi@@ our@@ al changes , a cog@@ nitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or medications - classic dormitory , only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ qu@@ ire . &quot;
&quot; it is hardly any case in Germany , Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , Head of the interdisciplinary dormitory center of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin . &quot;
&quot; that is why you should first turn to sleep problems , at first at the hous@@ ebo@@ arding . &quot;
the can be clari@@ fied with exam@@ inations whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep laboratory and what is happening ?
&quot; for an examination in the sleeping laboratory rates , for example in snor@@ ing with respir@@ atory , in sick@@ ness @-@ fatigue , for sleeping @-@ conver@@ ters , or if one does not find the cause of a sle@@ epy @-@ compul@@ sive disorder , explains Fi@@ etze . &quot;
in the examination you do not have to do .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; only please do not make a lunch , &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
after sales you go to his normal time in bed .
&quot; besides the electro@@ des of the body , one carries a n@@ as@@ al glasses , a chest strap and a smo@@ ker at the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera at the ceiling shows the sleeping area . &quot;
how can I control the problems in the handle ?
there are quite a lot of adjusting screws on which one can bet for better sleep .
&quot; wisdom counts to : regular sleep and asc@@ ending times , not too long in bed , on the day does not sleep , do not watch remote , alcohol , most and night not to watch the watch - then one starts immediately to count , and that &apos;s entirely or not condu@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
what the jungle camp with missing medals in swim
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus D@@ ei@@ bler came to dis@@ ap@@ point out by Facebook for the dis@@ appoint@@ ing of the D@@ SV teams at Olympic is .
in December 2014 he took the first time in Doha at the first time in Doha and presented his first World Council at the same time .
now the former D@@ SV @-@ Ath@@ let Markus D@@ ei@@ bler on Facebook is being put in front of his ex @-@ team members .
&quot; in a country where a Olympi@@ ad 20,000 € award gets and a jungle kö@@ nig € , no one should wonder about missing medals , wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old in the night on Friday on his Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; the conveyor system in a swimming sport be bad , the D@@ op@@ ing@@ controls , however very good . &quot;
&quot; in this way , we cannot compete with countries that promote very much and do not affect the issue of mental or even operate . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t say that here the controls should be adjusted , &quot; he explained further . &quot;
&quot; he wanted to start a com@@ eback , had already had nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ Doping Agency Germany ( N@@ ada ) . &quot;
this is how you should keep it with countries .

airport : Ban@@ de von Bag@@ gage
professional di@@ craft at the airport Düsseldorf
civi@@ liz@@ ations of Düssel@@ dor@@ fer police succeeded in organizing two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years .
the susp@@ ects had been committed as ban@@ de several h@@ ash@@ - and bag @-@ ste@@ els .
&quot; the civil officials of the airport in Düsseldorf are recognized in the area of the airport Düsseldorf , which was known to the polic@@ emen from past theft . &quot;
&quot; the two women and two men had committed several Del@@ ik@@ te since the mid July of this year , and were not very professional . &quot;
&quot; the specialists of the crime Com@@ miss@@ ari@@ ats 34 allows the th@@ iev@@ es , the stand for the desire of criminal off@@ ences to Germany were travelled , four acts . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , they had a total of over 15,000 euros . &quot;
&quot; old buildings , a few Lin@@ den@@ b@@ lows , inter@@ mitt@@ edly , in a rest of the head@@ lines : the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain affects the first glance , but the police counts them to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; the road from east to west along , it is possible to pass at play@@ grounds , a fres@@ hen nur@@ sery and a bi@@ ol@@ ades . &quot;
to the facade of a gray house someone has ugly ! &quot; spra@@ yed .
&quot; opposite from a Li@@ dl which is to be demol@@ ished soon : until 2017 , there is to be a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments . &quot;
&quot; article about this &quot; trendy neighborhood &quot; , &quot; like the responsible estate company Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain , will be preferred in the last weeks by burning cars . &quot;
&quot; the house is occupied with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the inhabitants of the rented rental , on the ground floor are still rooms occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning of the year , the Berlin Interior of Berlin had spoken several times for a hard approach of the police against the project , the area called &quot; no @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonom@@ ous violence . &quot;
&quot; after 22 June the rooms have been vac@@ ated on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , with 300 police officers , the police had three weeks of official statements , with 30 to 40 officials and three teams on @-@ site , bul@@ ky parts of the road and kept visitors from it , the house with number 94 . &quot;
currency buil@@ ders on behalf of the unknown land@@ owners the rooms .
&quot; on 13 July a Berlin Board of Directors , was decided that the clear@@ ing was illegal , and a day later went the police and buil@@ ders under the Ju@@ bel from sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; on this summer morning , the road peaceful : parents take a walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others chat about front . &quot;
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects there are a elementary school and nur@@ sery .
&quot; left violence is not the main square of many resi@@ dences : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lived in 1999 in the Kie@@ z , and Jana * , which took place here three children , especially by the police presented . &quot;
with the inhabitants of the house projects they share the concern of rising mi@@ ties and v@@ entri@@ fication .
it does not sound to a p@@ ie@@ z who wanted to con@@ quer the majority of police forces in front of the Left .
&quot; the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin inter@@ sen@@ ator and the police between home coun@@ cils and their neighbors , does not exist . &quot;
&quot; in the East of Berlin , Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working class , which today turned to the rest of the city a lower aver@@ ag@@ eness and high poverty . &quot;
&quot; also home affairs and the resulting living projects are already long as the p@@ av@@ als : 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer street very close to the Rig@@ a@@ er . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer had been vac@@ ated under large police force , many of the projects have been leg@@ alized , and are still inhabited by the people today , which they occupied 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the district of the past few years has increasingly become the magnet for tourists and elect@@ oral liner from all over the world : with them now share the residents of GDR @-@ times and former land@@ lords . &quot;
&quot; this also makes it noticeable in renting , which has increased by almost 60 percent since 2009 . &quot;
many of the new@@ buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : one can see them mounted on @-@ called sli@@ ces or fresh @-@ coated fac@@ ades , which were rejected with colors . &quot;
&quot; no other street was mentioned so often together with the words &quot; &quot; left @-@ aut@@ on@@ ous violence &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a reason for that , not all the neighbours could be seen as problem , that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes are not necessarily affected as a violation of body statistics , almost exclusively against polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; the most part of criminal off@@ ences make cases of damage , the ten@@ acity rather the new buildings and newly renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rental house next to the contro@@ versi@@ al 94 , there cannot be any talk of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; as for violence , it is compl@@ ain@@ ti@@ fying : people in the 94 are their neighbours , who were certainly not intended . &quot;
even the famous fer@@ vent @-@ burning cars do not give it directly to the Rig@@ a@@ er for longer .
&quot; for the studied architects , their street is not a crime burning point , on the contrary : &quot; &quot; here one helps each other , lives together on the road and get more of each other with , than wo@@ unded . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has been deliber@@ ately drawn into the Rig@@ a@@ er street - and remained .
&quot; for this reason , it was also so important that the residents get back their street : from the police , the politics and the media , which in July all claims the interpretation of the district in July . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to take away : through assured new buildings in former belly , which imp@@ ose the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; these are eventually con@@ dom@@ ini@@ ums , which are not interesting here - here are more people who are not so well toler@@ ated , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction can I have absolutely not gu@@ ardi@@ zing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but what should you do , if someone does not listen to someone ? &quot;
&quot; there is fru@@ stration at all sides fru@@ stration , even with the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; for aggreg@@ ates who like colour bom@@ bs , Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the house @-@ projects and the left scene belon@@ ged to the p@@ av@@ el . &quot;
&quot; who draws , should be aware - just like someone who can complain in a pub that can complain about noise there . &quot;
&quot; all of them only asked with names of names mentioned , do not be called to be named with their right name . &quot;
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is new refugees
Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in terms of integration and organizer .
&quot; in addition , she is a social worker on site . &quot;
&quot; since July , Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is the refuge@@ e for Ur@@ bach . &quot;
the pe@@ dagog@@ ical pe@@ dagog@@ y in support the team of management around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; she sees itself as a contact partner for all players : refugees , working group of refuge@@ e assistance , administr@@ ations , authorities and who else . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine customer of the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than thankful that D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the ei@@ ght@@ leg@@ ged Woll@@ mil@@ ch@@ sau , which above all has an issue . &quot;
&quot; so some - less spot@@ ting than rather on the variety of desired fields , targeted , meant when managing the position wanted to write . &quot;
&quot; we were looking for a administrative consultant with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ term experience in the field of social work , even a sc@@ er@@ ected Woll@@ mil@@ ch@@ sau . &quot;
&quot; administrative labor is not its central area , suppose Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; above all , it is about organization , work with local people on site and also behind the scenes as well as network value . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been here for about six weeks .
it has a 50 @-@ percent job on three years of extension .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer , that Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le ehr@@ an and full @-@ war actors support . &quot;
&quot; there are large and small problems , organisational , human and per@@ tin@@ ent problems . &quot;
soon there are new containers in the det@@ er@@ way
&quot; a serious problem has been to be found for some time , apartments for the refugees who have been acknowledged . &quot;
the municipalities are responsible for the connection .
they must accommodate refugees in their own or reserved residential rooms .
&quot; the costs for the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities themselves . &quot;
the responsibility changes from the shore office to the Commun@@ e and J@@ ob@@ center .
&quot; problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment . &quot;
the search has been designed for some time than very difficult .
de facto the administration has no private apartments .
&quot; it does not work until now , be dependent on private apartments , so D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the common apartments must be clear@@ ed as it is so beautiful . &quot;
so soon new containers are placed in the det@@ er@@ way .
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; perspective is the key@@ word , are Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot;
&quot; besides a fixed b@@ lei@@ gh , there are practic@@ able training , training courses , A @-@ euro @-@ jobs and contribut@@ ors for refugees and migrants who have to be consolidated or set up . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reported Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
&quot; many work in the Bau@@ hof or help jan@@ itors , do profit @-@ profit work - and this motiv@@ ates and very tidy , as Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le reports . &quot;
hopes that the work for the communities leads to a positive effect .
&quot; this is &quot; &quot; no employment therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
activity does not mean only work .
&quot; the day need a fixed structure , say D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and customer . &quot;
people need to develop an belonging .
&quot; so there are offers such as sports , contacts with n@@ atives and above all Spanish courses . &quot;
professional courses are r@@ ary .
so also here administration and volunte@@ ered .
&quot; it is central that the refugees get the feeling , they are welcome in Germany and welcome . &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; they must explain the refugees that it takes , and it can make the time useful for instance , for example , with language courses . &quot;
&quot; who sometime developing the feeling , he could not help in Ur@@ bach anyone who don &apos;t work and be unn@@ ütz , who will never be integrated . &quot;
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; but problems are also , says customer honestly , &quot; people , where nothing goes . &quot; the work of D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and customer is always to motiv@@ ate others to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
all this is already a &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task . &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : have the two after the recent ent@@ ails fear of radic@@ alization , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer quite clearly , &quot; what man@@ cher may call na@@ ï@@ ve . a rest might be able and would not want to exclude them . &quot;
&quot; to raise awareness , the hel@@ pers were already . &quot;
these inci@@ dents are also subject to refugees .
they had the fear that the attacks put them completely in re@@ vocation .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with this , &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; so , main - and Honor@@ ary event must keep on site and in the region following activities . &quot;
they always have in the background that soon a new store of refugees and migrants would come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a upper limit ?
&quot; clearly , this question is clear to answer . &quot;
&quot; actually , it is unfair to place it on site . &quot;
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we have not yet arrived , where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
no new refugees who would be able to relax .
&quot; Reg@@ ine customer also makes clear that the Ur@@ bacher also proved to be successful , the existing ones are reasonable . &quot;
&quot; currently , this is about 100 people , mainly young men . &quot;
&quot; but if people are in need of afflic@@ tion , both women are united . &quot;
&quot; the political situation is so complex , there are no simple answers . &quot;
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : sought @-@ down with hel@@ icopter
the police hel@@ icopter flew around an hour of different areas - un@@ successful .
two unknown men are for@@ getting rolled in an apartment in a apartment house in Lin@@ den@@ weg .
the inhabitants escap@@ ed the two and sm@@ ote the oun@@ ce into the escape .
&quot; the two men were about 1,@@ 65 to 2000 metres large , probably mas@@ hed , both Blue@@ je@@ ans and black Cap@@ u@@ zen@@ pul@@ lis . &quot;
you fle@@ e in the direction of downtown .
the police put several strikes and had a police hel@@ icopter .
the fasting ran without success .
perhaps the unknown before the apartment or her flight fell upon .
