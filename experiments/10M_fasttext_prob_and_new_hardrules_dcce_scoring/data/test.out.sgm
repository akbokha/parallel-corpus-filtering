<seg id="1">Clintons and Trumps economic policies compared: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and prevent trade agreements TTP - they want both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"however, the two US presidential elections are reflected in the tax and energy policy, as well as in a critical query."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the differences in the economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a basic, rather philosophical difference."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the, on the role of the state."</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep in doubt rather small and warned of how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to gaze the economy to death and regulate in death he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">"he himself would be quite different, maintains Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will be massively withered, and he is committed to far-reaching tax reform with lower control movements - for individuals and for companies."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton on the contrary, says: the state has specific tasks to open, he has given disadvantage opportunities and needs money."</seg>
<seg id="11">"therefore, the taxes would increase in the rich, says it."</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in the mses to be invested, Trump and Clinton are almost advertised."</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic rating will be the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in the infrastructure are classical democratic policy and are strictly rejected by the state-critical Teaparty-wing of the Republican.</seg>
<seg id="16">On Trump could therefore be part of internal discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">Clearly are the differences in energy and climate policies.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump aims to build coal-power plants and drive the coal production in the US again.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production should also be possible in so far-protected areas that he wants to announce the Paris climate protection agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in contrast, Clinton wants to expand the Renewable Energy Investment Programme and calls for:" "a country will create the superpower of clean energies and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"but not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far away from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the drank-fish trade agreement, both do not want to sign."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, both, however, do not want to isolate the USA from international trade, but just to protect American jobs better."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the should then also be paid better, calling for Clinton."</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a hungry.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it on 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage has to be, then he says, he does not likely to be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the coming months is likely to be likely to develop the tax policy of both camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on one side stands Trump, who wants to boost the economy and the citizens to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">"his critics stop him, so that the household deficit would just be even bigger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand Clinton, who want to ask at least from the rich that they pay more taxes, and their critics: more taxes are not the solution."</seg>

<seg id="2">"sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone, almost to everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="3">"when they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized."</seg>
<seg id="4">A house provides refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a large kitchen sitting four women.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each has a baby at most one year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has laid her little son in her arms.</seg>
<seg id="8">He gued with great eyes curious to the room.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother died on the table.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until they notice that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles short and kissing the little.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene works normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">To speak with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it is the curator of Condrobs, a carrier for social assistance offers in Bavaria, and deals with the topic of women on the run."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are refugees.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in Münchner North in one of the few decentralised accommodations for all women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January Condrobs established the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Münchner's Assistant.</seg>
<seg id="18">"unfortunately, it was officially opened."</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">Men are not there - also not as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guard to the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who arrives here has done on her flight experiences with sexual violence," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee because of wars, because they are politically prosecuted because they threaten torture or death or because their families send her as a hope for a glimpse of Europe."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in women weigh other reasons for the escape," many steal is secretly, because they do not see any other way. "</seg>
<seg id="25">"in their home they have experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, volunteering, slavery, or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">This continues it away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run it goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"that tugs for example for a bottle of water demand a sexual act is not rarity," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"and the women are alone, they are not protected by their families."</seg>
<seg id="30">"who believe that the end once they anchor in Germany, irre, tells Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="31">"even here, women were often considered to be underestimated and worse women were abused in refugees and worse."</seg>
<seg id="32">"this leads to that about 90 percent of women who live in the house in Münchner North, traumatized."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not written voluntarily."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so special that they say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they don't want to speak openly about the experience, because the shame is too big."</seg>
<seg id="36">"since they are often not able to help, find it more accommodations just for them, requires Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="37">In Bavaria the seven District registers for the accommodation of refugees is responsible.</seg>
<seg id="38">"the question whether they live from a similar project such as in Munich in its jurisdiction range, answers a few with no."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in the Oberpfalz region and Oberfranken, there is such a thing in shelters of governments."</seg>
<seg id="40">"even in Schwaben alone, women are not separated alone, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, Pressesprecher of the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Upper Bavaria, Lower and mid-sized people there are some common floors, or own houses only for all women and their children."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Lower Bavaria, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">Also the Committee "Rights of Women and Gender Equality" in the European Parliament calls for women need to be accommodated from men.</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study that was released for the Committee, it is said:" it is very important that men and women are separate. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"lack of privacy or being accommodated men and women, there may be - continuous - violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"especially the washing rooms should be separated and for women be easily accessible, is available in the study."</seg>
<seg id="47">"how much the women can feel this protective needs, one can proceed to the crush, which there is in the house in Munich."</seg>
<seg id="48">"ever since have spoken, that there is us, we have a long queue," "says Bahr."</seg>

<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>

<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterplayer in the gold-plated Hall of St. Petersburger Palastes in reception, I can not deny myself to the inscripture that Ankara wants to take this reconciliation."</seg>

<seg id="7">"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in contrast, spoke of his" dear friend "" - according to a report all five times. "</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also spoke that relations with Russia would return not only to its old level before the crisis, but even better to improve."</seg>

<seg id="11">Me seemed to be my enthusiasm rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin-radiant, sustainable cooling showed that the head of Russia had nothing forgotten."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory lecture: the shot of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey."</seg>

<seg id="16">"the failure was even bigger, since it was committed by a supposed friend."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the cousing to rebuild it becomes difficult, if not even impossible."</seg>
<seg id="18">The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months, the nationally controlled media led a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at once, it seemed as would the Turks apply to all the blame."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in the most sought the allegations of leading officials, that Erdogan has benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria, which might be controlled by the so-called Islamic state."</seg>
<seg id="22">He has denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">"after all, this meeting took place only because Putin received from the President Erdogan the excuse he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could win a sort of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara the benefits of a cease-fire is clear on the hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan needs first and all friends who he can get after spending last month at a failed state-rich almost his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repetitive terrorist attacks to Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motifs.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Russian sanctions have hit Turkey - especially the prohibition of charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year."</seg>

<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry in the West as it is his reaction to the tried of power over a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"to this end, the continued Groll about the Snail of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pipike on it is to move from the cool mood and to reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in Ankara, the Russian state of State won a bonus for sure that he called for the elected government authorities for the elected government organs."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is well-made for Moscow, a matter of course, that has changed a deep fear of rain."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit in this shiny palace was made by the sea in Russia and Turkey, one as it once formed a analyst" "Alliance of aliens" ": two countries which can emerge from the West and have been troubled themselves."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two still."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently been the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be apprehend that after nearly three hours of initial talk, both presidents on the press conference said that they had not even gestures the subject."</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey was apparent to answer a question about their differences while Putin decided to stress this.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>

<seg id="7">"Vaino, 44, is former diplomat."</seg>
<seg id="8">"1972 born 1972 in the Estonian capital of Tallinn, he made his conclusion at the renowned State Institute for International Relations (MGIMO), and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo."</seg>

<seg id="20">This is no one at all times.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official statement - that a man who once was once more pronounced as a potential president to once forward the Russian environmental policy - came across a great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in his remarks on Putin, who are quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - I could almost say - complaining about four years."</seg>
<seg id="23">"as it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential management for four years and eight months."</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin's former member of the State Security Council of KGB.</seg>

<seg id="2">The SPD and Green believe: investors should be much stronger in the future.</seg>
<seg id="3">How does one react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments in the coming years?</seg>
<seg id="4">The SPD strikes a "act concept in the next council meeting."</seg>
<seg id="5">But controversy is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost about the question: who is supposed to build the cheap apartments actually?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing.</seg>
<seg id="8">"SPD Group president Christoph Bratmann means:" "we are holding us with the Greens: who wants to build on urban areas will have to point 20 percent of all the apartments as a social housing."</seg>
<seg id="9">"however, the favorable apartments may also be drawn in the continuance."</seg>
<seg id="10">"but the great dispute point in the city hall is, however, as Bratmann:" how do you want to build investors who want to build on private areas? "</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want investors to build on such areas at least 10 percent, but as possible 20 per cent of the apartments as a social housing."</seg>
<seg id="12">"a new municipal house-building program, which will cost millions of cost and must be financed, must provide incentives for incentives."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the problem, so violmann:" there is currently no agreement between the groups. "</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make investors as few as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants to be hardness as well as for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">"regardless of this, so violmann, baits is a sharpening of the situation on the residential market."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the action concept is implemented, which will ensure additional tasks in the management administration."</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we get the experts.</seg>
<seg id="20">"still the program is not entirely: because the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway."</seg>
<seg id="21">"how does one comparing the loss of further around 1300 cheap apartments, which will run over the next few years?"</seg>
<seg id="22">"until the year 2020, there will be 500 apartments."</seg>
<seg id="23">"to prevent this, as the planatory spokesperson Nicole Palm, should now be sold out of the city."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in addition, it would have to be asked to return apartments back into the pricing."</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the west town.</seg>
<seg id="26">On one fell swoop the problem solve.</seg>
<seg id="27">Because at the west town the beginning of the year are already running.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments you could get there back into the pricing for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only: they do not want the owners, the housing societies not."</seg>
<seg id="30">"because the number of social housing in the west town is increased dramatically, one is removed from the target of the so-called mix-mix."</seg>
<seg id="31">There should no longer be a concentration of social weak in just a few city districts.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens expect that there will be even movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Group Leader Holger Herlitschke means:" for a vast majority, the CDU must take the boat. "</seg>

<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed by massive demand that overload the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon Go had more users than ink and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>

<seg id="22">"thus, three pillars of health covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people join the hunt even new friendships.</seg>
<seg id="24">"as always there is also mürcher game, which must always complain about something."</seg>

<seg id="25">And with some points - in the unequal treatment of Gedildered for example - is the question: what does this actually have to do with safety and terror?</seg>

<seg id="3">"before you made the commentment, to overtake him under the pseudonym non-terrestrial man's age with rust insults, this statement leads to current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov is the most frequent reformation of sound panels not to see a boom in millennials, who want to welcome the realism of physical objects but to Midlife-nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently bought a record are all foresight according to the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact the age group of 18-24 is the most likely buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">"it is also not a hordes through hobby collectors" - it has an emotional meaning: older plate, retain their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it to spend their own time (69% vs. 66%). "</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog would be a news report on TV, I would follow the camera while in the midst of a busy road in Soho, a humble flowerage and wild stud, before I steal my hands and tell something about it," so, let us take a closer look at it. "</seg>
<seg id="10">So let us take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">"even though the heart of Sohos slowly turns out to his charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent seller have been based, there is still a handful of fantastic turntables."</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the camera to turn the camera to the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to assess their age and mixtures through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I was aged by Sister Ray (Dates: two young women, three men aged men) into the Reckless Records (data number: eight men aged men, a woman, presumably about the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the business to fill the few hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector that I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I already value", "he says."</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 boards."</seg>
<seg id="17">"this sound panels, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I am not followed by him), clothing the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles, the result of his available income: he is now able to buy boards, which he could not afford to buy them, when he was released, when he was young and rich."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things that I buy, are from the late sixties, early 70ies, which was released, when I was 11 or 12. things, when I was probably something too young to buy them," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"it is true that those who buy boards, rather introverted and likes to spend their own time, and adds:" I don't smoke and I dare not very much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my Laster.</seg>
<seg id="22">"WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, believes that many customers who meets the YouGov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, he has also noticed a new wave of people who have heard about the medenhpe, people who heard about the comeback, and rely on to buy their old records."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from the talks, which I have led, people usually have collected about 1998 or in 1999 of their collection."</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of trailers of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the innate emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a shop such as phonica to detect that restores a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to WEZ, some of the older customers participated in the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">Some turnaround-fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to go back to the stability of familiar sound controllers, of objects, the happenings impaired. "</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think, sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possessions of material possessions as a kind of comfort," says WEZ. "</seg>
<seg id="32">This is as a collector for me and I think that it is so many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to employ intellectually.</seg>

<seg id="35">"a survey of the ICM in April unveiled that almost 50% of the people have bought a record for the last month, they have not been heard."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey was also out that 41% have a record player that they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record, no record player."</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report I would probably look very concerned while I was leaved through a stack at Bossa Nova compilations.</seg>

<seg id="46">"even though the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the front-standing shops - Wild Beasts New Testament - and sextuous pop instead of experimental jazz from the loudspeakers - it is good to see such a diversity among customers."</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks onderously lonely but nagging psychic traumas are hard to detectable if you stand for someone over 30 seconds.</seg>

<seg id="50">"it does not deserve much, therefore the collecting of plates does not require real option, says it."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it is easy to hear music from one computer or another way, but the beauty of plates is..." she drives with a loving sigh. "</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it really is unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">"my last stop is a business, which is said that a new generation of turntables are meant to be inspired: urban Outfitters."</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I give the candidates, the Jeans-Hotpants to patterns, watch out a group of young teenager, grouped for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter superior to buy a crosley record player."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left there is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"nobody sees it - maybe because they are only purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to grasp them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "sheet art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that any attraction for these items mean more money for the industry and to send some customers into the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain."</seg>
<seg id="60">"there is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, also the one that is most for some of the new units like records."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even though my afterforgeries agree that the results of Yougv vote, let them, at least in record business in Soho, the large number of female collectors and turntables that exist in reality, record business and in Onlineforen exist."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>

<seg id="6">And then there is also Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women's warm with dimples, could possibly have been sent under this known name to be sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and welfare TV advertising when he would be a swimmer, turner, or even a real."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fighting in olympic trampolines around Gold."</seg>
<seg id="9">The olympic flame illuminated not every event.</seg>

<seg id="11">We will always have the breast swimming and let it reign for a long time.</seg>

<seg id="7">"however, in the last few months shakeable protests against the government the country and stretches more and more areas."</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people hit the streets and slowed fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The response of the government was unmerciful by human rights organizations unmerciful.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses passed that policemen were shot in zig unarmed protesters and killed.</seg>
<seg id="11">"turning the videos about the protests, which are presumably seen from the last or beginning of this year, will show how security businessmen have to beat out, while these were forced to make a handstand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The Chief of the UN Authority of Human Rights is now demands a closer examination.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to keep this country and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project manager of Africa from Africa the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country of Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiopians, to fight counter terrorism over the region, especially in Somalia. only few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much Western aid."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopian economy expands in a remarkable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">His infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new pendant in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The streets are generally quiet, safe and clean. "</seg>
<seg id="19">"even if Ethiopia was anything but an example for democracy - human rights organizations have continuously led the repression of the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted, whereas the presidents were effective."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent into exile or prison, killed or pushed into the desert of the wilderness."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you do people suppress and do not have any other options except to protest, it breaks off," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopian. "</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation is protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous ailments that cover everything from the ground floor up to the thropoise in terms of power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after a far-reaching election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time the tensions along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this zackly, controversial line called on June hundreds of lives."</seg>
<seg id="28">"analysts are concerned that separatists, like the Oromo-Liberation Front or the National Liberation of the Ogaden, which were more or less enforced in recent years, which could benefit turbulence and rebels."</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of pre-holes under the surface are now exploding.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only in recent years, many Ethiopians were able to communicate with social media, as cheap smartphones have become more frequently and improved the Internet services."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via internet-proxies, which hide, where they are."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians have made that they gathered themselves so much to proteins.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity among the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnics in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"since then, the Amresas made the Amresas, which come from Äthopia predominantly Christian highlands, in politics and economy, while they exploit the Oromos, of which many Muslims are living and living in flat-regions."</seg>
<seg id="37">But also this is changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are here, under a umbrella to coordinate, said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos."</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests found in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos, the feeling that Ethiopia dominates a fair of members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which are about 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in the military in the intelligence sector, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr Meles, a former rebel leader, was until his death in a non-natal disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiopia's prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think of the corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">"analysts are saying that he was especially sealed it was to use early signs of dissatisfaction and special officers, to edit opponents and to make them harmful."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime is lacking in this basic skill," "Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst."</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopian new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected for suaded reasons in order to take the position of Mr. Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"other than Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of North America, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts are saying that he enjoys not enjoying the confidence of the Tigray controls.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time that Ethiopia was a rebellion in 2005, after thousands against elections were protesters, according to the statements of analyst seemingly from the government and subsequently were stolen."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the following symptoms, many protesting were killed, even if there were less than in the last months and this time of unrest went relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"development experts praised Ethiopian leaders for their visionary Infrastructure planning, such as the new commissors, as well as for their measurable progress in the fight against poverty."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this does not have the intensification of the internal misgunst of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And she takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month of grips protesting in Gondar, an amharan city, by Tigray-guided shops and the hatred opposite the Tigray is becoming more and more exercise."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts are saying that the protests in the USA and other Western allies are based in a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as a base for Dronenflights over the neighboring Somalia, even though it was recently enched that it has closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want to merge its allies in a already volatile area."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," "said Mr Abdi," is a very thin crest. "</seg>

<seg id="2">Programmers of corruption malware currently rely on companies and are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">"according to a recent survey of malware experts Malwarebytes, among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany 40 percent of the surveyed companies were at least once, partly several times of attack with Erpresser software."</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany nearly 20 percent of companies already were the target of a ransomware extortion.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims should be demanded by the perpetrators of the perpetrators of the challenged systems and data in order to use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their represser software according to the observations of malwarebytes to attack in attacks in the company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in this case, they are successful, the potentially result of dropping ransom is clearly higher than with private users."</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a terrifying fast evolution of damage," "Malwarebytes's Chef Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the" world. ""</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008 most malwareprograms were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then we discovered the perpetrator software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">"only then private user had the goal, but the change came to company attacks in the past few months."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Ransomware actively work after a simple pattern: once on the computer of an opfers, she seeks targeted after unlong changed files like Word-, excel- or database files as well as to archives of images and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encoding the ransomware and deletes the originals.</seg>
<seg id="14">"subsequently, the software presents the demands of the prespresser."</seg>
<seg id="15">"to get the end turnkey code to the files, the victims need money - mostly in the form of Cryptowering Bitcoin."</seg>
<seg id="16">"however, where private users use the personal photo database on the game, it is with companies about sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production is shut-down."</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly higher the damage falls off when a ransomware fails.</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 percent of the affected German firms affected by Ransomware, 13 percent even had to underbreak the operation, in case of a case people were living in life."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Germany, several hospitals were victims of attacks, whose patients can be threatened by loss of sickness."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we say the victims always: pays not, it only promotes the problem," explained Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"80 to 90 percent of companies that pay, get their data again."</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult to reject and reject the demands of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hacker again know this and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study the security researchers have been studied from F-secure the utility surfaces and contact with the investigators and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to establish a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">"you declare your victims via chat, as they can pay by Bitcoin, freely accessible support websites, or decrypt example files."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and they will redeem individuals after payments of few hundredt euros, companies need to negotiate tough and five hundred sums up to get back their data uncoded."</seg>
<seg id="27">"given the potentially high and relatively risk of profits from the ransomware extortion, the hackers are becoming more professional and share the work, explains safety experiniewski from Antivirus provider Sophos:" a single person can write a ransomware about within a week. "</seg>
<seg id="28">Probable it is however that it is about three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmer sell their contamination then in the form of a software construction to the actual presser.</seg>

<seg id="8">"so some - less spotting than rather on the variety of desired fields, targeted, meant when managing the position wanted to write."</seg>
<seg id="9">"we were looking for a administrative consultant with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-term experience in the field of social work, even a scerected Wollmilchsau."</seg>
<seg id="10">"administrative labor is not its central area, suppose Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="11">"above all, it is about organization, work with local people on site and also behind the scenes as well as network value."</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been here for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50-percent job on three years of extension.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine customer, that Annika Deuschle ehran and full-war actors support. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"there are large and small problems, organisational, human and pertinent problems."</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon there are new containers in the deterway</seg>
<seg id="17">"a serious problem has been to be found for some time, apartments for the refugees who have been acknowledged."</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must accommodate refugees in their own or reserved residential rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the costs for the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities themselves."</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the shore office to the Commune and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">"problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment."</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been designed for some time than very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto the administration has no private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">"it does not work until now, be dependent on private apartments, so Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, the common apartments must be cleared as it is so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers are placed in the deterway.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">"perspective is the keyword, are Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree."</seg>
<seg id="30">"besides a fixed bleigh, there are practicable training, training courses, A-euro-jobs and contributors for refugees and migrants who have to be consolidated or set up."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reported Regine customer. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the Bauhof or help janitors, do profit-profit work - and this motivates and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports."</seg>
<seg id="33">Hopes that the work for the communities leads to a positive effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this is" "no employment therapy." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">Activity does not mean only work.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day need a fixed structure, say Deuschle and customer."</seg>
<seg id="37">People need to develop an belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so there are offers such as sports, contacts with natives and above all Spanish courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rary.</seg>
<seg id="40">So also here administration and volunteered.</seg>
<seg id="41">"it is central that the refugees get the feeling, they are welcome in Germany and welcome."</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"they must explain the refugees that it takes, and it can make the time useful for instance, for example, with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"who sometime developing the feeling, he could not help in Urbach anyone who don't work and be unnütz, who will never be integrated."</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"but problems are also, says customer honestly," people, where nothing goes. "the work of Deuschle and customer is always to motivate others to motivate others."</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: have the two after the recent entails fear of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," "says Regine customer quite clearly," what mancher may call naïve. a rest might be able and would not want to exclude them. "</seg>
<seg id="50">"to raise awareness, the helpers were already."</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They had the fear that the attacks put them completely in revocation.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with this," "says Regine customer."</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">"so, main - and Honorary event must keep on site and in the region following activities."</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that soon a new store of refugees and migrants would come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">"clearly, this question is clear to answer."</seg>
<seg id="59">"actually, it is unfair to place it on site."</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we have not yet arrived, where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle. "</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees who would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">"Regine customer also makes clear that the Urbacher also proved to be successful, the existing ones are reasonable."</seg>
<seg id="63">"currently, this is about 100 people, mainly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but if people are in need of affliction, both women are united."</seg>
<seg id="65">"the political situation is so complex, there are no simple answers."</seg>
