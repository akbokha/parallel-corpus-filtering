&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it should also deal with the conflict with the Palestinians and discussed two @-@ state solution . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for many years .
Washington critic@@ ises the permanent sett@@ ling of Israel and thro@@ ws a lack of faith in peace process in Net@@ any@@ ahu .
&quot; by the death of Obama to the Iranian nuclear programme , the relationship between the two continues to deteri@@ or@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu had held an invitation to the invitation of the Republi@@ can speech before the US Congress , which was viewed as an aff@@ ront against Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not spoken by Obama , a meeting had rejected this with reference to the dates of the election in Israel . &quot;

he said that he had made the for@@ ce@@ ful not@@ ing at some point then .
&quot; until the end of the day , there was another death : lam@@ b took the life , when the police took him at . &quot;
&quot; a day after shooting at the university , students and lect@@ ur@@ ers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what he &apos;s motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details published by the investig@@ ators in both of the state of the state , as well as what students and staff who knew him , were helped with an image of a talented , but maybe difficult teachers to draw . &quot;
&quot; students , they said that they were pleas@@ ures in his lessons . &quot;

&quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said , he did not know anything about a conflict between he &apos;s and Schmidt , but of course , there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs concept . &quot;
these are questions which can no longer be answered here .
&quot; after the flight from the campus , the police took place in Lam@@ bs when he returned to the Mississippi of Ark@@ ans@@ as import . &quot;
&quot; before it could be arrested , he &apos;s self @-@ made with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house around a mile south of its parent house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , said Washington County Cor@@ ion meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;

&quot; it was not immediately clear why lam@@ b went to this house , but Johnson said that he knew that he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
he grew up in the area .
&quot; he &apos;s represented in 2009 his work at the University , the 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12.@@ 000 inhabitants and has established geography and pe@@ dagog@@ y . &quot;

&quot; they see all the girls that he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson suburbs of Brand@@ on residents . &quot;
he &apos;s represented and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; he said in this call , &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate of a marriage . &quot;

&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , he had never met him , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that he was interested in music and blues playing . &quot;
he &apos;s represented Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail appeared both in front of three years ago both in the summer of the year .
&quot; later , they played together in one way or another . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , his daughter writes and s@@ ings its own music . &quot;

8 De@@ fl@@ ages which show that Donald Tru@@ mp is serious about taking .
some have tried to brand it as a flop .
others have taken him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tru@@ mp from the upper ranks of the surveys , it has ( still ) does not work . &quot;
ten of the last eleven national surveys revealed Donald Tru@@ mp in the two @-@ digit range and some start to seriously wonder@@ ing what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of the property type .
of course it is too soon in the election period .
no claims that Tru@@ mp will likely win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts emphas@@ ise that at that time in 2011 R@@ ick Per@@ r@@ ys was submitted to the Asc@@ ent Herman C@@ ain , of which none of them became only a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a common choice .
but outside @-@ groups such as J@@ eb Bus@@ hs Super P@@ AC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth are now recogni@@ zing Tru@@ mp@@ s through stamina and start their dollar to jump around .
here are some current to@@ kens to suggest that the real estate is not just a temporary phase :
Tru@@ mp@@ s popularity have been fil@@ med by 180 degrees .
&quot; just before Donald Tru@@ mp announced his candi@@ da@@ cy in mid @-@ June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans saw the estate of Mo@@ gu@@ l . &quot;
to the middle of July it was 40 percent .
in the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now six out of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tru@@ mp .
&quot; approximately three of ten say that they have a negative opinion . &quot;
and these figures remain in the early States .
a qu@@ im@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa has established last week that 60 percent of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good idea of Tru@@ mp .
two thirds of the GO@@ P voters GO@@ P would be happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
&quot; in a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week 67 percent of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans , they would be either &quot; &quot; enthusiastic &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; satisfied &quot; , &quot; if Tru@@ mp would be short@@ listed . &quot;
&quot; only two of 10 can say , they would be &quot; angry &quot; &quot; if he would be the candidate . &quot;
&quot; Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm like Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent ) , they would be &apos; thrilled &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same about Tru@@ mp ) . &quot;
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of the Republi@@ can voters say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; angry &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , the Candi@@ date . &quot;
a majority of the Republi@@ can sees Tru@@ mp@@ s temper@@ ament not as problem .
&quot; while Donald Tru@@ mp is cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed on his bom@@ bas@@ tic and offensive statements , believe 52 percent of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans of Irish voters believe that the real temper@@ ament was the right temper@@ ament for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is valid in the first prec@@ arious state of the nation , the State of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a comm@@ ander @-@ inf@@ alli@@ ble , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless 44 percent consider that he will not have the personality to effectively perform his ministry , and almost six of 10 inde@@ pen@@ dents said that his temper@@ ament is not in the White House , so ABC / Post . &quot;
rep@@ ublic@@ ans voters get used to the idea .
if they bew@@ are their money @-@ cloth@@ s , rep@@ ublic@@ an voters Tru@@ mp are for real . &quot;
&quot; if they are asked who is winning the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , according to a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C from the past week four out of ten that Tru@@ mp are the best bet . &quot;
&quot; this has been a change since the time , when four out of ten at the end of July you made their money to J@@ eb Bush . &quot;
complete disclosure : GO@@ P voters had not the most exact crystal ball in the past .
at this time in the last cycle we thought four out of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans that R@@ ick Perry the nom@@ ination would win over only 28 % for the final candidates Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
&quot; nevertheless , it shows that a large number of GO@@ P @-@ voters Tru@@ mp@@ s campaign is seen as pl@@ au@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; even if the rep@@ ublic@@ ans gathered around another candidates , Tru@@ mp proposes almost everybody . &quot;
some experts suggest that the spl@@ itting field probably contribute to Tru@@ mp@@ s guidance while the anti @-@ Tru@@ mp support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidate .
&quot; but a survey of the Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head race between Tru@@ mp and most other rep@@ ublic@@ s candidates , Tru@@ mp &quot;
&quot; he has before Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points ahead , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ himself and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it is a head @-@ in @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who suggests him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ in @-@ head .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald &apos;s Tru@@ mp @-@ fans tells that they have formed their minds .
&quot; a new survey of CB@@ S / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters provide the Tru@@ mp , saying that they have fixed their voices . &quot;
&quot; of course , a lot of things can happen to change this , and no one can truly say to change the opinion . &quot;
&quot; 46 percent said that they can leave the door open , in order to switch to other candidates . &quot;
&quot; nonetheless , Tru@@ mp@@ s strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ ch@@ ir@@ urg Ben Car@@ son , but voters say they have formed their minds are twice as often for Tru@@ mp . &quot;
six out of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they are with Tru@@ mp in the issue of immigration .
&quot; since Donald Tru@@ mp in his elect@@ oral campaigns of two months of immigrants from Mexico &quot; &quot; r@@ ust &quot; , &quot; was the immigration and fishing in public discour@@ se to 2016 . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ bas@@ tic expression of Tru@@ mp are far @-@ known H@@ isp@@ ano @-@ Americans from the Republi@@ can party and damage the re @-@ oriented efforts .
&quot; however , according to the new ABC / Post @-@ survey of Monday , six out of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , that they are with Tru@@ mp in questions of immigration . &quot;
&quot; as long as the immigration in the li@@ mel@@ ight remains , Donald Tru@@ mp will apparently do . &quot;
the fru@@ stration of the government climb over to new high@@ s .
&quot; by now , Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son fell by now roughly half of support by rep@@ ublic@@ ans voters . &quot;
&quot; six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans are speaking of ABC / post , they rather want a political out@@ si@@ der than have someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are fur@@ ious at Washington .
&quot; a survey of D@@ es Mo@@ ines register / Bloom@@ berg in I@@ owa 14 weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa Rep@@ ublic@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co. : the five most exclusive residence in Germany
here is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the Nord@@ se@@ ew@@ att .

a new study reveals that special lungs have one square meter most costs .
&quot; of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little . &quot;
in contrast to Germany &apos;s Top @-@ residential buildings comes from the price however as Pe@@ anu@@ ts .

Champions League : Bavaria Dre@@ ams thanks to Müller and Gö@@ tz@@ e
two @-@ fold scor@@ er in Piraeus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one running .
a happ@@ ier place by Thomas Müller eb@@ b the FC Bayern opens the way to a earned 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ak@@ os Piraeus - then ran .
a sovereig@@ n pre@@ lu@@ de of the Champions League @-@ season .
&quot; the World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario Gö@@ tz@@ e have made a dream start to the &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the team of Trainer PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won their appearance in the Champions League at the Greek record Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to gar@@ bage dump ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and id@@ ol@@ es hit ( 8@@ 9th ) deserves with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ fth team of success is to be the first step towards the finale of May 28 , 2016 in Italy where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola will finally take up the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t after Munich . &quot;
Müller was at his 28th place in the Champions League for Bayern @-@ guidance of assistance from Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto which allowed one as fl@@ ank the thought of the world &apos;s master@@ y .
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; had Bavaria captain &quot; &quot; had promised Bavaria l@@ ah@@ m before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is @-@ stadium in front of 31.@@ 688 , and the Mün@@ ch@@ ner kept word . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated perception without too sh@@ ines .
&quot; Piraeus had won his recent six hom@@ est@@ ay in the realm class , including against well @-@ known clubs such as Manchester United , at@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
2011 stum@@ bled here also Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
&quot; but Bavaria , in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up @-@ du@@ els with Greek teams un@@ defe@@ ated , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they went cour@@ ageous , but by their off@@ ensi@@ zing efforts , but often too un@@ all@@ evi@@ d@@ ently to work . &quot;
the attacks have often sei@@ zed on le@@ ak@@ ing Douglas Costa Rica by the former Braunschweig Om@@ ar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i against the former Braunschweig Om@@ ar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had on the right hand more luck than his fl@@ ank taken from the right half of the left in the left upper case .
in the 63@@ th minute the world champion the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half of one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first at first as the Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown proposed the head@@ ball of Poland by the line ( 26 ) .
&quot; then by direct , the go@@ alie Roberto with his kne@@ es par@@ d ( 3@@ 5. ) . &quot;
&quot; although Bavaria re@@ used to domin@@ ate the domin@@ ating game , Pi@@ re@@ ed@@ ra@@ che could put Piraeus . &quot;
on Tor@@ hü@@ ter Manuel Neu@@ er was but reli@@ ance on .
&quot; about , as he has a shot of ide@@ ye on the Lat@@ te l@@ enk@@ te ( 5@@ 6. ) . &quot;
&quot; recently , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola left a quad@@ rup@@ ed with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , which made it well . &quot;
&quot; Mario Gö@@ tz@@ e , after mus@@ cular problems back in the Ka@@ der , sat at first outside . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup hero gave only after the final training , gave sports fore@@ front Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; who wants to make something else from it , this is already mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; even at the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought with King@@ sle@@ y Com@@ an for the ov@@ ens ov@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ tz@@ e came late for Art@@ uro Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and did 13 minutes later everything clear , by El@@ f@@ meter was still a dr@@ one . &quot;
in front of the game it was come in stadium to tie .
&quot; after a smaller group of fe@@ eders Bayern @-@ fans in their spect@@ ator block , the trailer of hosts spoke about words and gest@@ ures had prov@@ oked , attacked the security forces and went with head@@ lines up against the Mün@@ ch@@ ner followers . &quot;
at least an Bayern @-@ Fan was viol@@ ated from the stadium .
&quot; who smo@@ ked , has a higher risk to lose teeth . &quot;
&quot; who smo@@ kes , sh@@ end@@ eth not only the lungs , but also the teeth - that makes a Potsdam @-@ long @-@ term study . &quot;
good news : in case of ren@@ unci@@ ation the risk is fast .
&quot; smo@@ kers have a significantly higher risk , losing their teeth . &quot;
&quot; this goes out of the long @-@ term study of international research teams , including several employees of the German Institute for Nutri@@ tional Research ( DI@@ F@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to non @-@ smo@@ kers , in smoking the risk to lose their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely to lose the 2,5@@ - up to 3,@@ 6 @-@ fold higher . &quot;
the scientists had been observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
&quot; prot@@ agonist of tooth decay , car@@ ies and infl@@ amm@@ ation of the gin@@ gi@@ va , stres@@ ses the DI@@ F@@ E . &quot;
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis is a risk factor that empha@@ size the authors .
the connection between smoking and damage is therefore taking place on frequent fl@@ esh@@ y infl@@ amm@@ ation in rob@@ ber@@ y .
not clari@@ fied whether smoking is also risk for car@@ ies .
&quot; people who began dying with smoking , may reduce their risk within a short time , write the researchers in the &apos; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
&quot; however , it could take over ten years until the endangering again dro@@ pping back to the level of non @-@ smoking , the former author Thomas Diet@@ rich from the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; man must convince people of it , non @-@ smo@@ kers , said studying H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoke , shor@@ tens the lifetime . &quot;
not to smoke is good for lungs and vessels and leads to our knowledge also to a good dental health to the high age .
over 20 percent of people aged 65 to 74 years have been affected by dent@@ al@@ ment divided the DI@@ F@@ E .
previous investigations have already pointed out that smoking is the risk of early tooth decay .
the new long @-@ term student empha@@ sizes the fun@@ nel .

&quot; to the shar@@ pen@@ ing of the dispute over the planned Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade Agreement ( TTIP ) , the EU Commission has proposed a large reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot;
&quot; the contro@@ versi@@ al private arbit@@ ration organisations for disputes between companies and countries should therefore be clear@@ ed by a transparent system , which significantly corresponds significantly more traditional dishes . &quot;
&quot; we want to set up a system that close the citizens , &quot; &quot; said the EU @-@ Commissioner Cecilia Malm@@ ström at the presentation . &quot;
the sister has to put the proposal as a European negoti@@ ating position in the free @-@ trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
&quot; through TTIP , the largest free trade zone of the world is to develop with 800 million people . &quot;
&quot; the plans to reform the current arbit@@ ration proceedings are specifically facing , that the EU states and the US are together independent judges for a new investment Court . &quot;
they are intended to come from the EU and third countries .
for the first time this is also a second instance .
it would allow it to rise up against jud@@ g@@ ments .
&quot; so far , the trial took up among each other on Ar@@ bit@@ er , an ins@@ uring against their jud@@ g@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; in the discussion of the past months , the citizens of the old IS@@ DS system in terms of fairness and justice will not trust , commented Malm@@ ström . &quot;
in the long run she wants to go to an international investment course in the long term .
there may be either a disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries .
the investor @-@ state requested @-@ arbit@@ ration ( IS@@ DS ) are considered one of the main reasons for the major resistance in Europe against TTIP .
&quot; the traditional Ar@@ bit@@ ration are critic@@ ised by critics as a type of Parall@@ el@@ ran@@ z , refl@@ ecting the companies tax@@ pay@@ ers , national laws , or reduce consumer standards and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in first opinion , anti @-@ TTIP @-@ organizations like Camp@@ act established the EU Commission &apos;s proposals as insufficient . &quot;
cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed that they are not intended to apply for the free trade agreement ( CE@@ TA ) with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) .
the German Political State Secretary for Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) spoke the plans as a great progress .
&quot; the Commission considered significant differences in the reform essential points , the federal states of Sig@@ mar Gabriel in the spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ral tribun@@ als be of the table .
the French government welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European Association of B@@ US@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE re@@ war@@ ned of limit the economy of the economy by too many new rules .
especially small and middle companies could be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
when the talks about the TTIP TTIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded on Wednesday continued .
the negotiations have been underway since the middle of 2013 .
&quot; however , the issue of investor protection has not been discussed with the US until now . &quot;
&quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot;
this date is no longer available .
Del@@ ik@@ ater Folk by Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is sitting on the stage at the Köl@@ ner Prime Club ( now : Lux@@ or ) .
&quot; beside him , a fli@@ p@@ chart , to which the shy po@@ vers recorded the picturesque U.S. state of Michigan with fel@@ t@@ pen . &quot;
&quot; the entire audience , about 40 persons , is nearly taken by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s presentation . &quot;

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s Deb@@ ug@@ t at the Question of the Prime Minister
&quot; since his election , Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s debut at the issue of the Prime Minister , with tension expected &quot;
&quot; the new Labour chairman of Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n shall give his debut at the Prime Minister of the Prime @-@ Minister , and will rely on David Cameron for the first time . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to address the first of its six specified questions shortly after lunch , taking his performance from the media probably and the Labour Members will probably be nearby . &quot;
he requested &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could ski@@ p some sessions to leave it to colleagues .
&quot; this meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s guidance , as she comes to his appointment as a member of the shadow of the shadow and his speech on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the decision of the Labour president has prov@@ oked during a memorial celebration at the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , cri@@ tique from a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs , and is at the center of several front pages stories in newspapers . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s decision not to sing the national hy@@ mn has attention to itself
&quot; a coordin@@ ator of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said , he would have been &apos; respect@@ ful of silence &quot; &quot; and he accepted the &quot; Hel@@ dent@@ um of the Royal Air Force in the air sl@@ um of England . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told in the BBC Two News@@ night @-@ Program , he obtained the Labour Party , who ought to sing the Labour Party , regardless of his faith that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shadow mini@@ stries have consec@@ rated to serve in Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s leading team , and they are called upon differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a six @-@ sto@@ el of the parliamentary party originally supported as guide . &quot;
&quot; the Political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also st@@ acking within the Labour Market and also by Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s statements to the European Union , and the limit of violence . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour Party lie in order to remove the whole idea of a limitation altogether .
&quot; hours later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ work and pensions ministers , that the Party is &quot; &quot; very clear &quot; &quot; that it is only against the government plans to reduce the limit of 26@@ 000 £ to 23@@ ,000 £ . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour chairman , that David Cameron has since been released , since last decade is over the D@@ isp@@ atch Box in the parliament . &quot;
&quot; the Labour chairman , promised a different policy sentence , says that he has given &quot; Cro@@ w@@ d @-@ s@@ our@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr. Cameron and gave him more than 30.000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; Is@@ lington North MP has said that he is ques@@ tion@@ able to con@@ front the issue of the Prime Minister and confron@@ ting it with &quot; &quot; impact strength &quot; &quot; and the dispute with resistance movement and instead it can focus on serious issues like poverty , inequality and the challenges facing young people . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle is represented by the shadow of economics , if he is not participating - for example if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad . &quot;
&quot; he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally grab the Word , and that he said John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the sub@@ house , addressed to the issue . &quot;
&quot; when he became leaders in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he wants to remove politicians in the style of a &quot; Kaz@@ per@@ le @-@ Theatre , who often is linked to the Prime Minister of the Prime Minister . but a few years later he kept that he failed . &quot;
&quot; since she was sent in television first in 1990 , the questionn@@ aire was regarded as the most important bar@@ ometer of the Ur@@ du of a leader , and his leadership in the House of Commons , and his position in the House of his parliament , although critics have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and must @-@ suff@@ iciency of the reforms . &quot;

Met@@ cash does not start working campaign to fight ag@@ di@@ z dis@@ inf@@ est@@ ation .
&quot; Met@@ om tries to protect the Ig@@ A @-@ branch in front of a Al@@ di @-@ Char@@ ge in South Australia and Western Australia . &quot;
foods wholes@@ al@@ ers Met@@ cash have launched an Ground Operating campaign to defend the market share of Ig@@ A @-@ ret@@ ailer in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; during Al@@ di , the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia will prepare their relationships with local food suppliers and build up the brand Ig@@ A through ma@@ instream Media and marketing on the Social Media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de show . &quot;
Ig@@ A @-@ traders and suppliers jump on board with brands such as Eis@@ maker S@@ immo from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough that distributed in Ig@@ A @-@ shops and shop@@ ke@@ e@@ pers who sell the association for the South Australian soccer division to loyal customers .
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ cash will be publishing further details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ al@@ ers for food , alcohol and devices leads to its annual investors strategy . &quot;
there is much at stake because South Australia and Western Australia almost 30 percent of Met@@ cas@@ hs Ig@@ A @-@ shop@@ pers are exhibiting and higher profits as Met@@ cas@@ hs Ig@@ A @-@ Network in the East @-@ states .
&quot; purchases in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ep@@ ic provincial and Ig@@ A @-@ ret@@ ailer holds a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia in comparison with about 14 per cent in East states . &quot;
&quot; however , Analy@@ st like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di twelve months after opening its first markets around five percent of the food market in these two states will grab away and all available players , but mainly independent retailers . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published in this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath by Morgan Stan@@ ley that Ig@@ A @-@ ret@@ ailer 360 $ million turnover per year and Met@@ cash $ 250 million to the end of 2016 could lose . &quot;
that progn@@ osis is based on the assumption that Al@@ di has opened 25 branch offices in SA and 30 in WA and achieve a turnover of 500 million $ and 600 million $ in each market .
the loss in foodstuffs and grocery and in amounts on Met@@ cas@@ hs high fixed costs may cost approximately 13 million dollars of profit before interest and taxes ; said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath .
&quot; at the same time a met@@ ric market shares in eastern states , mainly due to Al@@ di and CO@@ LES , although a recent survey of Roy Morgan found that Ig@@ A @-@ purch@@ as@@ ers were the faithful . &quot;
Morgan Stan@@ ley takes that Met@@ cas@@ hs turnover in the food and grocery store by 3.8 percent in 2016 to 4.8 percent in 2018 and to reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.5 percent by 2020 .
&quot; last week , the leading fonts of Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , at a business dinner in Melbourne , that Met@@ cash will likely van@@ ish within a decade . &quot;
met@@ ric ref@@ used to respond publicly to the comments by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash should contact Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
&quot; IG@@ As market share has been consolidated since 2010 by 18 percent to 14 percent , and income from Met@@ cas@@ hs dietary and food stores , which is approximately 1.@@ 200 Ig@@ A @-@ ret@@ ailer , has been supplied by 43 percent , which reflects the operating debt of simultaneous pressure on sales and mar@@ gins . &quot;
the wholes@@ al@@ ers re@@ es itself and is investing more than 150 million people to attract retail prices with CO@@ LES and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths at hundreds of products every week to improve their stores by fast growing fresh food and to deliver a better choice of private label food products .
Met@@ cas@@ hs &apos;s main business leader Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price custom@@ ization and charging programs to be made to vig@@ or and hopes that the wholes@@ aler in 2017 for the first time in four years will return to a profit growth .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the president of the Australian tennis club Steve Heal@@ y
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves more praise than critic@@ isms for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ater@@ als &quot; in the shortest storm around his friend Nick K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os and deserves to view the president of the Australian tennis association Steve Heal@@ y rather praise for his own behaviour .
&quot; Kok@@ te@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , which is always referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; gr@@ ated by the in@@ famous examination of K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os with St@@ an W@@ aw@@ r@@ inka in the Montreal Masters in the spot@@ light . &quot;
&quot; in a fier@@ y qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after that Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison twice are separated by the refer@@ ee while Har@@ rison had to beat K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os , and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; while it was last seen as he sm@@ elled a tennis r@@ ack@@ et , after a var@@ ic@@ f struck out a potential US Open @-@ victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by Heal@@ y . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in competition with Sam Gr@@ oth on the second place in the single table behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup finals . &quot;
&quot; one thing that I &apos;m pretty sc@@ ei@@ ve , the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi is raised a little in the dispute . &quot; &quot; Heal@@ y said . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a r@@ ack@@ et , when he moved to the US Open in the US Open , but it is not the first player who has broken a r@@ ack@@ et from Fr@@ ust , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he has become extremely well in the US Open , even under the pretty pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison , and so on and I think he deserves a lot of recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him and I think he was treated a little too strict . &quot;
&quot; he is a very thr@@ ust 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he doesn &apos;t work in the team and so on , he is well trained in the locker room , he is well trained in form , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged by his own mer@@ it . &quot;
&quot; Heal@@ y also assisted the decision to consider K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os on the important pre @-@ decision , which begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return to return to a long @-@ term solid element into the team . &quot;
&quot; first , we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not on all the contro@@ vers@@ y around &#91; K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; &quot; Heal@@ y . &quot;
&quot; and I believe that Nick was made very quick the climb , what he has been pointed out in the eyes of the public , and he has made some sh@@ lim@@ me mistakes and deserves all the cri@@ tique of doing so . some time outside the li@@ mel@@ ight , in which he can only think about it , and it &apos;s best for the crew and it &apos;s the best for him . &quot;
&quot; Europe refuge@@ e crisis : Hungary declared Emer@@ gency , close the border , keeps refugees return &quot;
&quot; Hungary explains the emergency , and ri@@ fu@@ elled the south @-@ border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all that were tried to come illeg@@ ally into the country . everything with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants . &quot;
chaos followed at the border as hundreds of migrants gathered together in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and Serbian authorities with rebel@@ lion .
&quot; the people who fled from violence , sur@@ ges for a unknown period in a land strip on the road between the two control points of the countries qualified and built tents , and settled down there . &quot;
but fru@@ str@@ ations of .
&quot; when a police hel@@ icopter above them ho@@ vering about them , the migrants &apos; fle@@ es the border ! &quot; &quot; and sm@@ iled ins@@ ults against the Hungarian polic@@ eman . &quot;
some were returned from protest foods and water .
&quot; Serbia &apos;s foreign ministers declared it &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; that migrants would be ref@@ used from Hungary , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece . &quot;
( Serbia ) does not want to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ater@@ al harm .
&quot; in the coming days we have to take place in discussions with Brussels and other countries , &quot; I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence in the hung@@ arian @-@ Serbian border came one day after the 28 @-@ nations @-@ block in a str@@ ative meeting in Brussels no common immigration policy .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 4@@ 0,000 people who were in the predomin@@ ate Italy and Greece . they expressed their hopes that finally - next month or until the end of the year - an agreement would bring that the EU @-@ states further 120@@ .000 refugees , including some of Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria demanded a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; Hungary , however , did not put its hopes on an Baltic promotion in Brussels or from its neighbors . &quot;
&quot; the report on Tuesday studied in two southern regions , authorities giving more powers to get out of the crisis , so they could accelerate roads and asylum @-@ ways . &quot;
&quot; the Hungarian Secretary of Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ j@@ ar@@ to said that his country will lead to the construction of a bar@@ bed @-@ drama , in order to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - having finished a fence at the Ser@@ b border . &quot;
&quot; CB@@ S News @-@ correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even j@@ aw @-@ ups were reported in the race , the bar@@ bed @-@ wire @-@ fence , set between Hungary and Serbia . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a considerable rap@@ port from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East to a significant Eng@@ age and entering into the European Union . &quot;
&quot; Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban was insi@@ sted that most milit@@ ari@@ sts are looking for better life , and not war escap@@ ed , who are entitled to protection - a view that is strong contrary to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws that occurred at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or damage to the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high Za@@ us that put the government along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also put higher adhesi@@ on for ver@@ tically man@@ tr@@ ader . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation created by mass immigration , the Hungarian government explains the emergency , &quot; said President Z@@ OL@@ TA@@ N Kov@@ acs por@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eged . &quot;
we say it very clearly : illeg@@ ally border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must support process technical nor the use of the military , which is expected for next week , but re@@ por@@ ter from Associ@@ ated Press had already seen the border with heavy armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ org@@ y Bak@@ on@@ di , country security consultant for Or@@ ban , said that authorities should cross 45 people when attemp@@ ting to cross the border , 15 other were already deeper into the country . &quot;
&quot; they come across , damaged by the fence , they are now in police officers , and become acc@@ used of criminal off@@ ences according to the new laws . &quot;
authorities are fast to repair the fence quickly .
&quot; Hungarian official closed on Tuesday morning also two of the seven border out@@ ings with Serbia , after a train carri@@ ages with bar@@ bed wire , to close the borders . &quot;
&quot; chaos prev@@ ailed the most important border out@@ flow near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hungary opened a small office in a metal container , to process the data of people and oppressed a crowd , to push themselves up there . &quot;
&quot; about 20 succeeded however to take it , but thousands remained outside . &quot;
&quot; another group of migrants blocked the most important highway connection from Serbia and Hungary , and said that food and water would refuse to travel to Hungary . &quot;
elections 2016 : Hill@@ ary Cl@@ int@@ ons domin@@ als before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in the national survey
&quot; the former US Secretary of Hill@@ ary Clinton continue to hold a two @-@ digit advantage in the democratic race for nom@@ ination on a national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders gains its opposite on the ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton now has support for 47 percent of democratic voters for pre @-@ elections ( 58 per cent before ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; Vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet been proclaimed if he is for the Russian Federation , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the elections . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the beginning of the elections , say most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion stands or what candidates them will support . &quot;
but Cl@@ int@@ ons supports them in their choice as those of the other candidates .
&quot; since the CB@@ S @-@ News survey , Clinton had lost in a number of demo@@ graphic groups , while others achieved some profits . &quot;
&quot; Clinton holds a great lead in women and temper@@ ate , but these proj@@ ections have reduced . &quot;
&quot; your support in the men is considerably dropped , and S@@ anders is here only with 5 points . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ int@@ ons benefits for democratic voters under 50 years of age has fle@@ eting , and they are now in equal measure . &quot;
Clinton had a big lead in the older voters .
&quot; in the past month , Clinton had been with double @-@ digit lead in the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot;
&quot; about half of the democratic voters of the pre @-@ elections , say they would like to support Clinton , if they were nominated by the Party . &quot;
a quarter would support her with some occurr@@ ences and another 15 percent would only support them because she is the cand@@ y .
six percent would they not support .
&quot; maybe not surprising that Cl@@ int@@ ons current supporters , especially from you are thrilled . &quot;
the views are more mixed at those who currently Clinton does not support - just about a quarter would strongly support it .
&quot; while 48 percent of the democratic voters of the presidential elections say that they Clinton compete with enthusiasm , say less rep@@ ublic@@ ation voters this over their go@@ enk@@ andi@@ daten Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; when Cl@@ int@@ ons are asked in an open question why they want , that she has the right experience that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidates for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
Cl@@ int@@ ons Supports also mentioned their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to the handling of problems and the paraly@@ sis are also being quoted .
&quot; since the vice @-@ president calls for a potential for the Russian Federation to see the scales , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes it should not do it . &quot;
&quot; when democratic voters are asked for the elections , who would be the second choice for the party is bi@@ den at the top . &quot;
&quot; of Cl@@ int@@ ons followers more than half that Bi@@ king would say far ahead of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t decide to channel not for the nom@@ ination of the Democratic Party , the Hill@@ ary Cl@@ int@@ ons pushed ahead of S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ den in the race on 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; five @-@ five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a nomin@@ ee with the best opportunities to win the elections , however , that number of 78 percent in the last month . &quot;
&quot; bi@@ den is by far the second in this measurement , but the percentage of those who sees it as the &quot; vis@@ ually , &quot; has risen . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , on the question of what is more important to a candidate , the Democratic voters ask questions about the paraly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; just like in the last month , no single democr@@ acies candidate or potential candidate for these elect@@ or@@ sel@@ ections of the elections are unacceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidate or potential candidates bring good results in some important characteristics with constitu@@ ents of the election @-@ elections of their party .
&quot; Clinton shall consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; biblical cuts among the three candidates best with honest@@ y , while Cl@@ int@@ ons &apos;s strength is the leadership . &quot;
&quot; thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trusted , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not have any opinion of him . &quot;
&quot; democratic voters of the pre @-@ elections also see Clinton , S@@ anders and bi@@ den ide@@ ological in accordance with their views . &quot;
with all these measurements about a quarter of democratic voters has no opinion of S@@ anders .
&quot; for questions about Hill@@ ary Cl@@ int@@ ons continue to use a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term as an external sponsor , most of the Democratic Party of the Pre @-@ elections are pleased with their statement of the matter and say that their opinions are not found in total . &quot;
but it is a different story in the American public .
&quot; half of the Americans now are dis@@ satisfied with their declaration , while only about one third is pleased . &quot;
&quot; the public opinion was in March , shortly after the problem of light came , split . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the e @-@ mail contro@@ vers@@ y had no impact on her general opinion of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion of her still wor@@ sen@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; there are mainly Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more than six of 10 that said their views of Clinton became worse . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is seen as honest and trust@@ worthy , this is still a problem for them under registered constitu@@ ents : only 32 percent see it as honest and trusted , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 percent of those entitled to vote do not hold it for an honest and trusted person .
at the same time 55 percent of the entitled rant land @-@ far also Tru@@ mp is considered not honest and not trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tru@@ mp are receiving good music with lead .
&quot; cut out from the six tested candidates Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best with honest@@ y . &quot;
&quot; a majority regards S@@ anders more than honest , but as at Car@@ son many do not have any opinion of him . &quot;
the bug@@ rate for the sample of the 351 Democratic voters of the pre @-@ elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son approaches with nationwide survey close to Donald Tru@@ mp on
Ben Car@@ son is located with the latest survey of CB@@ S News / New York Times shut behind Donald Tru@@ mp
&quot; in the meantime , half of the voters gave birth to the new survey , and others will lose dramatically . &quot;
&quot; Republi@@ can voters support nationwide Tru@@ mp in large numbers . the support grows by 23 % in the last CB@@ S survey , which was conducted before Fox News debate last month , by 27 % in the survey conducted by Tuesday . &quot;
but Car@@ son f@@ oss in the same period from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey was also revealed that car@@ son strikes well in demo@@ graphic groups well and exc@@ uses by rep@@ ublic@@ ans with university education .
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio govern@@ or John Ka@@ un@@ es , who has fallen on the deep@@ est with Wis@@ con@@ dom@@ govern@@ or Scott Walker , who is in the deep@@ est part of 10 % in the last month . &quot;
the former Florida @-@ Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush . the former Gover@@ nor of Ark@@ ans@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida @-@ Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio are located at 6 % on the third place .
the mis@@ min@@ ar@@ ge in the sampling of 3@@ 76 people of Rep@@ ublic@@ s in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was carried out in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey conducted last week , shows that car@@ son rising in the surveys - he strikes at 19 % support in the rep@@ ublic@@ ans , behind the Tru@@ mp + 32 % . &quot;
the recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed tr@@ mp significantly before Car@@ son .
&quot; with a view to one of the last week of rising Car@@ son , Tru@@ mp found some side si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ sur@@ geon , even after Car@@ son would ap@@ ologi@@ ze for this , tr@@ ash faith in question . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp on last Saturday during a campaign in I@@ owa . &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean sea is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; even if top values are measured only in the distance , enough for bathing ur@@ ry already a trip to the Mediterranean to find even hot water . &quot;
a bath in North or Baltic Sea may likely be a rather short pleasure in a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; there is no more to the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees the water in the northern and Baltic Sea in this week , shares the German weather service ( DW@@ D ) . &quot;
&quot; in the east , they continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east there is even up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic , there are 25 degrees in the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Br@@ otherhood charged with the death of a bar@@ k College no@@ d@@ der
&quot; almost two years , after a student during a schi@@ p ritual , as a student service in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , Mor@@ dan@@ complain about five people . &quot;
&quot; members of the New Yor@@ ks College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ Delta @-@ PS@@ I @-@ Br@@ otherhood &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introductory ritual in September 2013 and consumed his transport to the hospital , leading to his death divided the police . &quot;
&quot; officials said , he had been loaded with sand loaded with a 30 @-@ pound back@@ pack of sand , and sw@@ elled , while trying to pass over a frozen field to a goal . &quot;
Mr. Den@@ g def@@ ends his he@@ ada@@ ches and then he fell unconscious .
&quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ PS@@ I @-@ Br@@ otherhood does not call the emergency number 911 , after th@@ g was f@@ ain@@ ted and wa@@ ited an hour before they brought him to a hospital so the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to switch D@@ eng@@ off clothes , his symptoms of goo@@ dies and Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Br@@ otherhood , to seek advice , said Poli@@ den@@ ef Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point the members , utensils began to hide and put the welfare of the Br@@ otherhood a principle over that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ signat@@ ef Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died in the next morning to his or her injuries . &quot;
&quot; after an op@@ yst@@ o@@ gue , Den@@ g were repeated with m@@ ute power injuries at head , trunk and th@@ igh@@ s . &quot;
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the Br@@ otherhood of the Br@@ otherhood . at least a student dies since 1970 every year to the ch@@ ic@@ anen , said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ ths family , in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; Bru@@ der@@ ships and their members must be held accountable , and this step by public authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury by Mon@@ roe signed an indic@@ t@@ ment for the first five members .
&quot; two thirty @-@ thirty members of the Br@@ otherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also indic@@ ted because of hi@@ jack@@ ed attacks and the formation of a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to make the people responsible , but if there is an organization that - officially or in@@ form@@ ally , so we will also hold it to account &quot; , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the Bar@@ uch College has forbidden the Br@@ otherhood , and the national Br@@ otherhood has re@@ vo@@ ke its affili@@ ation to the local group . &quot;
that will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; an inser@@ tion is coming , and the house will get into the wo@@ unded , return for bonds will rise , and the economy will gli@@ de in a recession . &quot;
this is what we know .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will last and how long it will last .
&quot; in particular , the history for the economy is just a small guide to the process . &quot;
a recession came within just 11 months after the first interest rate and lasted 86 months .
&quot; the aggression of the Federal Reserve on raising the interest rates is often , even if not always , a factor is how the economy and the financial systems are responding . &quot;
&quot; in fact , representatives of the US Central Bank have so inten@@ sely empha@@ sized that investors should not focus on when it starts to increase interest rates , but rather the period that is needed for norm@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; in the end , market participants could determine that the whole excitement because of an increase could possibly be exagger@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is inev@@ it@@ ably interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of the &quot; budget money &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Ch@@ ef@@ ö@@ ph@@ ol@@ ome at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of the U.S. interest to normal heights , but still up to a lower level to get to the se@@ is@@ mic shock , which seem to fear many . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no effect . &quot;
here is one of the historical trends of based look on how some areas of the economy could react ?
&quot; as the market has seen in the last month , the cap@@ tions of c@@ itation may make things for a while vol@@ ati@@ l . &quot;
&quot; once the increase comes , the influence is not so dramatically . &quot;
&quot; there seem to be a tendency that wealth claims for 12 to 24 months after the initial increase will be weigh@@ ed , which perhaps once again refl@@ ecting the delay in monetary policy , said Deutsche Bank Analy@@ st in a newer study on what happens after inser@@ tion threats of the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; more exact , the market has been in the past 35 years mostly in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to Z@@ inser@@ tion ( average gain of 2.7 percent ) , then back to normal yield of about 500 days , according to a recent analysis , the Bob D@@ oll , Chief system strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , by Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on shares ten@@ der@@ ships will occur later in the increases @-@ cycle , and returns the return to decrease . &quot;
&quot; rec@@ essions are a fact of economic activity , but interest rates do often encourage them . &quot;
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is faced with some conditions that previously did not have there and could accelerate a recession . &quot;
&quot; remarkable is here , that the gross domestic product is close to its lowest point in a cement of the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; according to the Deutsche Bank , the 118 C@@ ensu@@ s took place since 1950 only twice the nominal value of GDP less than 4.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was at 3,@@ 6 percent , only few that this will open and expect the third quarter following statements of Atlanta F@@ ed only 1.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; interest rates in such a fragile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and throw the question on whether it is different this time , &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; market participants have defined the F@@ ed for the whole year , and all eyes were directed at the Federal Open Market Committee in this week which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many roads and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could have an increase in this meeting , the Futur@@ ES trade shows only a lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study , all the increase of increases in 1950 to now in a super @-@ cycle with increasing momentum when GDP had taken place and on pre @-@ review very quickly after the beginning of recovery in the shadow &quot; , &quot; thus the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly long rest of what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
the current cycle is by far the longest that wa@@ ited the F@@ ed since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months ; and this is up to 74 months .
&quot; the firm income was also vol@@ ati@@ l , since the market occupies an inser@@ tion plans , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market . &quot;
the main difference is that the effect with bonds will be faster than with shares when change their strategic track .
&quot; in bonds the return appear to change the return , once the first increase / lowering is done in the cycle . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the increase @-@ cycle the shares shall fall immediately , the Deutsche Bank said . &quot;
Str@@ at@@ egen of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the rise in the interest rates will result in a closer connection between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a de@@ br@@ aking of the curve .
&quot; high @-@ rate bonds in such a climate change better y@@ ields , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher y@@ ields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed In@@ come Analy@@ ses in pigs . &quot;
&quot; interesting , says Jones that the markets already have adapted to F@@ ed Strategy . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decrease in inflation maintenance , there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest have risen , the yield , l@@ ending , l@@ ending have increased and the vol@@ ati@@ lity has risen - all the characteristics of the market if the F@@ ed has intensified its strategy . &quot;
&quot; in large and whole , companies that benefit most of their operations in the U.S. , benefit from interest rate , if interest rates change and local products become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; multinational companies with high debts will be worse , as an increasing dollar will make their products more expensive on the global market and also financing their debts . &quot;
&quot; the story shows that &quot; quality &quot; &quot; shares tend to respond very positively , three months after an initial meeting place , said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analy@@ st in a report for the customers . &quot;
&quot; companies with strong balance sheet have exceeded the average record according to each of the quot@@ ations in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 on average by 5 percentage points . &quot;
company with high capital investment and lower vol@@ ati@@ lity with their shares also extended their counter@@ parts with low quality at the average 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts will be a big issue .
&quot; with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose most , gold said . &quot;
&quot; outside the pure share games , consumers will also benefit from rising dollars . &quot;
&quot; saving could see profits through higher y@@ ields , even if experts are of different opinion , how quickly this will take place . &quot;
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM as well as a member of Andrew B@@ ingham
the Conserv@@ atives of the Parliament has critic@@ ised the transmitter due to his &quot; dou@@ bling &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is not distingu@@ ish@@ able from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also worked on the BBC Music Awards and said that she was merely the Br@@ its im@@ i@@ xed
Parliament &apos;s colleague Dam@@ ien Collin@@ s picked The Voice and said that this is not very original .
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; conver@@ ts &quot; to Classic FM , maintains a leading parliamentary member and raise new pressure on the stations , to prove that he does something that the private stations do not do . &quot;
&quot; the Conserv@@ atives Andrew B@@ ingham also said to the BBC @-@ bos@@ ses , that the publicly @-@ legal radio station &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; could no longer be distinguished by its commercial competitors . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 appears - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; - but it seems to be Classic FM &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot;
he also went to the BBC Music Awards held last December .
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , which started last year seem to be The Br@@ its only under a different name . &quot;
&quot; so if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples , where you actually only have the im@@ itate , which is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham . &quot;
&quot; BBC @-@ Director @-@ Director dism@@ is@@ sed the alleg@@ ations and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 far ahead of its commercial competitors , when it comes to live music and clarification of the public . &quot;
&quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , I will learn about classical music anywhere else . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly un@@ matched .
&quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 , to find new music and to order new works in order , I think also really is important , &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey made that harder to work hard to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 was not the only element of BBC @-@ production , which during the hearing in the Committee for the selection of culture , media and sport , made up of fire , the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Collin@@ s takes The Voice to - the musical talent show of the BBC , which has been bought by the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for estimated costs of 22 million £ . &quot;
&quot; see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and is not especially striking ? &quot;
Lord Hall consisted of the BBC 1 @-@ Show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - &quot; on special BBC way . &quot;
&quot; he added , he wanted to find that the company &quot; a hit from our house in our house , &quot; if it died the next time a entertainment series . &quot;
&quot; however , it ref@@ used to exclude the order from other rows of The Voice in the future or to equi@@ p money of the pay@@ ers for other sub @-@ behavior formats . &quot;
Internet Um@@ bre@@ eder in August at the slow@@ est and Black Friday can be responsible for it
in the first three months of 2015 there were seven percent increase in online sales .
in the last month there was the lowest result since the beginning of the record in 2000
online @-@ sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones to shop
experts believe that the Black Friday stopped in November the issue stopped in November
&quot; for over a decade , the virtual shopping coach has turned the virtual shopping streets and many of the main shopping streets of Great Britain have turned in Spirit &apos;s cities . &quot;
&quot; however , experts say that there are now signs of the online transformation , after new numbers only showed seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot;
the total expenditure on August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that there are signs that online @-@ sales will be stagn@@ ating after new numbers only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the years and go back to 2000 , this has always been developed in the course of time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ RG sales recei@@ vers of the Guardian . &quot;
&quot; stated that the online sales deal has increased three years ago , as a purchaser , using their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now , this is turning , and we may possibly experience that growth decreases . &quot;
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon that was imported from America is cited as a reason for the subsequent revolutions .
experts believe that buyers have their purchases before this event that takes place on the last Friday in November .
last year twenty times the average number of buyers for their computers to make their bar@@ gain and some ret@@ ailer falls off .
&quot; experts believe that black Friday , in whom the buyer would cl@@ ap for bar@@ gain , buyers of it could stop shopping . &quot;
a study of the British Retail Con@@ sortium finds out that of 5 £ issues a little more than 1 £ online was issued .
&quot; for some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one third of the purchases are now carried out via Web @-@ shops . &quot;
at the same time more than one quarter of the people buy clothes and shoes online instead of the Mo@@ ed@@ its in the cities .

Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the start of the annual p@@ addle in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; Saudi officials have already said that H@@ add@@ sch moved to Mec@@ ca with thousands , which will continue to come to the city . &quot;
&quot; today King Sal@@ man , the Bin @-@ Laden @-@ group would not have to ste@@ ered the arm of the sick , when he was not used . &quot;
&quot; an Arabic version of the Dec@@ gs , published by the State Saudi Press Agency , said that the bin Laden @-@ Laden @-@ group was responsible for the collapse . &quot;

the Bin @-@ Laden @-@ group has published no statements about the collapse of the Crane and its representative were not available for a comment .
the Royal Decree also cri@@ ed the group because of non @-@ current security measures and because they do not co @-@ operate with met@@ e@@ or@@ ologists .

B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is about
&quot; British employ increasingly craftsmen , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry &quot;
the number of skilled craftsmen in Eastern Europe has rise behind
&quot; this results in which 200 more screens supported by craftsmen , will be opened . &quot;
at the same time King@@ fis@@ her 60 B &amp; Q outlets are close enough
&quot; by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chef @-@ correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail &quot;
&quot; it is maintained that British will carry out their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified East European craftsmen who carry out works in their homes , &quot;
&quot; when you sk@@ ill@@ fully capture with a hammer or a brush to get rid of walls , you belong to a minority nowadays . &quot;

toolbar of A@@ I / D@@ ob due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on the national court of Kl@@ agen@@ furt will have to be responsible for the Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball vice @-@ I / D@@ ob for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and des@@ ist education .
the acc@@ used are not guilty .
one of them was tried for re @-@ consuming because of some of them .
&quot; from this acc@@ us@@ ation , he has been fully released in May in force . &quot;
the present process was postpon@@ ed .
&quot; according to Ober@@ sta@@ ats@@ an@@ walt Robert Ri@@ ffel ( acc@@ used ) , that the def@@ endants were used in the years 2006 to 2011 mon@@ ies of club members , about which they used in their functions disp@@ ens@@ ed for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; the damage caused by some 400@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the ath@@ work are also indic@@ ted for financial intermedi@@ aries .
&quot; this fact was the chairman of the Sch@@ op@@ en@@ sen@@ at , Rich@@ ard@@ Micha@@ ela San@@ in , &quot;
it should be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; to the acc@@ us@@ ation of the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence form the association at no time was created an asset . &quot;
&quot; the sports functional , only administration charges calculated and the sports club , for whom they had been operating from 1982 to 2011 , and in whom they invested a lot of time and money from debt by around 600@@ .000 ch@@ illing ( about 44@@ ,000 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at that time we stood before the situation : do we continue the club on or lock it , &quot; &quot; told , one of the acc@@ used , in the Br@@ ot@@ ap@@ f of the Financial Officer of the Financial Officer . &quot;
with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants he decided to take this task .
with all the risks .
&quot; we have paid money to make our life insurance as security at the bank , &quot; he said in the redemption . &quot;
&quot; agreed to the association : you can manage the money freely , there may only be no debts . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the financial success of the administration of the administration of the administration was postpon@@ ed until 1991 . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one portion of the administration of the administration has only been compens@@ ated for years later , since 2003 , as a plus in the account has been paid . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there are also l@@ ump and non @-@ details bookings , on , explained the former Chairman of the former Chairman . &quot;
&quot; accounts and austerity , the two acc@@ used together , said the second acc@@ used . &quot;
&quot; why the pay@@ outs made of the club have not been detailed in detail , the jud@@ gement asked . &quot;
&quot; in detail the association has not been interested in financial behavi@@ ors , if only the school &apos;s freedom has been , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; as in 2011 against the conc@@ ession of Am@@ t@@ sm@@ iss@@ row , an amount of 120@@ .000 Euro was transferred to the club account . &quot;
&quot; These have been appropri@@ ations , they explained the def@@ endants . &quot;
&quot; this value account was on the name of the second acc@@ used , and was not known according to the statement by the association . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; wanted to know the jud@@ g@@ ard . &quot;
after that the respon@@ dent had no answer for a long time .
&quot; then he said finally , he believed that this is the best for the club . &quot;
&quot; if something had happened to him if nobody knew anything of this money , the prosec@@ ut@@ or put into the room . &quot;
&quot; the co @-@ def@@ endant was informed , comm@@ ute itself to the function@@ alities . &quot;
this bank has been formulated as &quot; st@@ in@@ dem@@ nity . &quot;
why do in@@ dem@@ nity ? , wanted to know the prosec@@ ution and the prosec@@ ut@@ or . &quot;
&quot; to that , the first def@@ endants , he did not agree with this wording , because the association was never written a damage . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do if the attorney says , &quot; with whom you are all out of the hook . &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; , &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; furthermore the function@@ aries said , he has never taken a cent sal@@ ary , he merely expects vi@@ ability and di@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; at di@@ ets in charge of di@@ ets , he added the association 1,000 Euros per month , the actual effort was much higher , he added . &quot;
the exact documents for the early years could not proceed .
&quot; these are after an operating test , in which everything had been judged correctly , no longer maintained , explained them . &quot;
Kilom@@ eters also had the second acc@@ used .
&quot; all Beh@@ eb@@ ies shall be eff@@ ected in cash , for this he had to ride from his place of gen@@ ocide to bank after B@@ lei@@ burg , he explained in his statement . &quot;
the main proceedings will continue on September 23 with the survey of witnesses .

time of decision on interest rates for the U.S. Not@@ en@@ bank
&quot; the world has been observed if the US staves bank is coming to two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to meet the important decision whether for the first time nearly a decade or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey under 80 economies which were ques@@ tioned by Reu@@ ters , found that a little more than half , the last week of view was that the F@@ ed will do this , now think that the F@@ ed is still a little longer and will keep interest rates on the current state of 0 - .@@ 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; it is a historic event , because it &apos;s been seven years since the F@@ ed interest is applied to NU@@ LL . &quot;
&quot; for the first time we approach a situation in which a large central bank aband@@ on@@ est the null area and starts a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bi@@ de , director at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. economy is on a relatively good performance level , tr@@ illion dollars to record the balance sheet and generate just a small inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less critical view of global circumstances . &quot;
&quot; it war@@ ns the markets to adapt to an increase , but the signs indicate that chances against such a step are good . &quot;
the decision should be announced at 20.00 h ME@@ Z on Thursday
death : at the Delta State University leaving dism@@ iss@@ ful writing
&quot; after the shooting and killing of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning , and before he later drew his colleagues on Monday morning and he wrote Sh@@ ann@@ on &apos;s a note to say that there was &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; with the first murder and wished , &quot; &quot; he could make it happen &quot; , &quot; gave authorities on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , Mississippi , said that he &apos;s lecturer in geography and socio @-@ scientific education at the Delta State University , calling the emergency number to 10 : 00 am Monday morning . &quot;
&quot; and said , he was shot and killed on someone . &quot;
he represented the staff of the emergency pl@@ edge that the police would send police officers at his home .
&quot; he said , &quot; I enjoyed my wife yesterday evening &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; addi@@ ction dog &quot; &quot; in the house unless &quot; &quot; will not distur@@ b &quot; , &quot; but probably excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the c@@ aller after his name , but he did not give it . &quot;
he had no explanation for his shots .
&quot; police the scene bet@@ ray@@ al they found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note of he , 45 , who said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted it , I could be und@@ one . &quot;
&quot; I loved Amy , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
&quot; according to the letter of the note , 300 miles to Delta State University , where he taught E@@ AT@@ Schmidt , a professor of history , before he eventually took his own life on Monday night when polic@@ emen traveled him . &quot;
&quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said , he did not know anything about a conflict between he &apos;s and Schmidt , but of course , there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs concept . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , he &apos;s suppos@@ edly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , said authorities on Tuesday , there will be no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was conceived by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said it was about seven years married as a &quot; good person . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were viewed 15 years ago , but were friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were having a daughter who is 19 , and she was destroyed on the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss were her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to testimony of L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , which was identified by Sun Her@@ ald than a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who had a dog called Light@@ ning , had met with him for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she wanted to help other people , &quot; Know@@ les &quot;
&quot; he said , he &apos;s related to a certain point in the Monday to say to them , &quot; he did not go to prison . &quot;
&quot; when polic@@ emen it took him at the Highway 1 near Green@@ ville , later in this night , he went to the site , fled to the forest and sle@@ w himself with a shot . &quot;
he &apos;s represented in the spring of 2015 by the Delta State University a v@@ ein in which he gave to his studies on the website of the university .

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can not play monthly fr@@ ak@@ age for dou@@ bling
Luke Sha@@ w suffered in the Champions League &apos;s defeat of Manchester at the PS@@ V Eind@@ hoven in his right leg .
&quot; while this was brought to the left the def@@ enders of wines and exclude him for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w again in this season can play . &quot;
the injury was caused by a rel@@ ent@@ less attack by Hé@@ c@@ tor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20 years old Sha@@ w was in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated at the pitch nine minutes to the pitch and needed oxygen before he was transferred to the hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and lies in the hospital . &quot;
he will have moved tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operate in Manchester .
&quot; it is horri@@ ble - a boy , who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it has been very difficult and then it is fantastic , and then happens . &quot;
in the locker room he had an oxygen @-@ mask on .
he we@@ pt .
&quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double vision , then it takes six months , and it will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope he will play this season again .
Moreno seemed happy to be a red map and the im@@ position of a El@@ f@@ meter .
Nicola Riz@@ z@@ oli , the arbit@@ rators , has not been pen@@ alized the Mex@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
van Ga@@ al susp@@ ected that the Italian refer@@ ee was mist@@ aken .
&quot; you can judge for yourself , when I say that a El@@ f@@ meter and a red map were payable . &quot;
it was a very worse attack with both legs .
&quot; a T@@ we@@ et on Sha@@ ws Account sent : &quot; I thank you all for your news . words can not describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I am coming back more again . &quot;
&quot; here , Manchester United captured the loss of Luke Sha@@ w with the defeat at PS@@ V &quot;
the England def@@ ender has an added incentive to recover from the European Championship in France to recover until the coming June .
&quot; Philli@@ p C@@ oc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said , &quot; It is a very lim@@ lim@@ me injury . &quot;
&quot; if a player leaves this type of injury to the place , all are very sad . &quot;
it is never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate an opponent .
Moreno learned a leg of near as Mexico against Van Ga@@ al Holland company at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; he is very difficult , because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you then hear that it is a worst injury , that is not good , &quot; said C@@ oc@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball , who was in a different direction , so it looked , as if he had touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with S@@ B@@ S6 said Moreno : &quot; I know how it feels like , I know how difficult he can be . &quot;
I feel very bad here . I am sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Guar@@ da@@ do was also brought into hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ der by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it is one thing that all parents soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not last long until you know it nearly . &quot;
&quot; unless you are , you are perhaps David Cameron . &quot;
&quot; as he asked by a provider of child care systems , his favorite child &apos;s book has been asked , chose the prime minister of The Lor@@ ax , the 1971 created by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , writing Cameron in a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative , and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children because it seems always a picture or message that we have so far missed . &quot;
&quot; everything nice and well , except that the subsequent paragraph , in which Cameron alleg@@ edly describes the plot of the book , instead returns a summar@@ ies of the movie version of 2012 , add new characters and details to add the rather short original text . &quot;
&quot; among the rub@@ ber@@ ized city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , is hoping to see a boy named Au@@ dre@@ y to see the girl of Au@@ dre@@ y to see the girl of Au@@ dre@@ y , whose name The@@ odor Se@@ uss ho@@ stage was lau@@ gh and died in 1991 , but completely unknown . &quot;
&quot; as if this was not sus@@ pic@@ i@@ ously enough : the article presented by Cameron is presented sometimes like the summary of the Lor@@ ax film , which is artificial on the web site of Internet Movie Database and even the air is a commodity , hopes a boy named Ted , the girl of Au@@ dre@@ y to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he gives rise to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely to be familiar with the action of the book so little . here , an un@@ spo@@ ilt boy , how the local environment is said due to the cas@@ h@@ ous , Tre@@ ax , a ho@@ sters , sn@@ ak@@ y beings , &quot; that says in the name of the trees &quot; , &quot; wo@@ unded . &quot;
&quot; possibly such a relatively low PR @-@ task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per , who did not read the Lor@@ ax for a maximum of 20 times in a child . &quot;
&quot; a down@@ ing @-@ Street @-@ speaker , said that the text probably came from Camer@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Camer@@ ons employees , but has no further immediate comments . &quot;
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threat@@ ening to the exclusion from England &apos;s team but it &apos;s still difficult
&quot; to encounter Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , a difficult task , but when you chose the Ka@@ der , the England for the tour , is a re@@ petition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series not on my map . &quot;
I would not exclude a down@@ wards .
&quot; Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks page may perhaps be less experienced than three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the Batt@@ ing @-@ up , and the community spirit is strong ; they will no sc@@ ars of 2012 carry , just a cent @-@ positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; the ball is developing Mo@@ een Ali as a spin @-@ Bow@@ l and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if it represents an un@@ familiar size in the test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
herein is referred to as Adam Ly@@ th separ@@ ating from the England Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex Hal@@ es .
&quot; the decision to allow Adam Ly@@ th , is of course to be hard for me as its ch@@ op trainer in Yor@@ k@@ shire . &quot;
&quot; in his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that critics are oriented towards results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and this led to nom@@ ination , since - and I said this - player their own best selection . &quot;
&quot; a long time ago I had prolonged the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own destiny . &quot;
if he hopefully turns out further sales to Yor@@ k@@ shire comes another chance .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss pra@@ ised his attitude even if he did not get so good accompl@@ ishment and that aston@@ ishes me ; he is above all a team @-@ man .
&quot; the question , how much time a test @-@ stroke will get to put his mark , is difficult . &quot;
Ly@@ th got seven rewards - such as Sam Rob@@ son in front of him - at Nick Comp@@ ton nine .
just Comp@@ ton got the chance to do @-@ it @-@ do @-@ stop @-@ playing and down@@ wards .
&quot; the only acc@@ us@@ ation that one can rise , was that England was first appointed to Jonathan Tr@@ ott in the Caribbean - but this lost opportunity is now in the past . &quot;
&quot; Alex Hal@@ es is in , and he is a stroke which I cher@@ ish highly . &quot;
&quot; it is a X @-@ factor Cri@@ cket@@ player , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season , when he sco@@ red 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much . &quot;
&quot; he must receive at least the same chances as those before him , but of course this depends on the team position of the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to let Mo@@ een next to C@@ ook , let go out what an extra @-@ spin @-@ Bow@@ l would bring and four p@@ icks off , and I have nothing against it . &quot;
I don &apos;t see why a stroke will not beat there and this link @-@ handed has already shown that he is a hot @-@ shot of cri@@ cket players .
&quot; Mo@@ een may not have a job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but is it a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my former team coll@@ eg@@ ars Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first drop before he joined in 2001 as a Open@@ er .
he immediately got away a hundred R@@ uns and didn &apos;t look back .
&quot; Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes to the cad@@ re as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited deal of dealing with it he was very impressed as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may see their statistics - an average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ k , but there is no big number of backup r@@ ots who raise their hands and the trainers have decided for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team England made a few smart supplements at the coach .
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ t , the Bat@@ sman from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the trial , could be a master coup . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nicest guys of the game that becomes a wealth of experience , since he played amongst all the conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes to the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and powerful use into the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he is created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and as Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh air to the locker room , even if the messages are in accordance with the previous mess@@ ag@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; Coll@@ ys Team coll@@ ars near Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , will not be employed at the One @-@ Day@@ er , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I for my part have no problem whatsoever . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but co@@ aches and team @-@ ups do not determine the schedule . &quot;
and you must remember that in terms of players will hin@@ ge their jobs from the results .
such decisions are not made of light heart .
the Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ Camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = Set@@ ting Great Britain from the EU ) could lead to Zul@@ u when the economy up to 2017
&quot; David Cameron &apos;s un@@ balanced new strategy to hold Great Britain in the EU , will burst into difficulties with every day , even without the choice of geni@@ ous Jerem@@ y &quot; &quot; Is Yes or no ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which was severe in Europe on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; foreigners have also made their Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s , and Nig@@ el Far@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; a European diplom@@ at and told curious , that some member states , so deeply im@@ part@@ ed into various crises as the EU is now and not always from their own debt , Great Britain &apos;s agenda with stressed @-@ conc@@ essions and dis@@ closing agreement , which they usually do not want , s@@ lick . &quot;
&quot; in Brigh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided on her annual meeting that it may not like , if they thre@@ aten the social protection . &quot;
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and Finance Ministers climb on the summit meeting or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of yourself from a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say they can gain allies for reforms . &quot;
it is always about me .
&quot; my European friend who wish to look for the right great Britain inside the EU tent - &quot; &quot; Let us not stand alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and let us see that more and more short @-@ sigh@@ ted ministers and officials came up to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter if we remain or going . &quot;
&quot; Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious Chancellor Angela Merkel is a allies , but it has been in power for 10 years before it looks bad for them , as it is bad for them , like Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
French President François Hollande can look back to his re @-@ election or its replacement in 2017 .
he is also a bl@@ ending force .
&quot; Poland may soon have a nation@@ alistic right government , Spain a left @-@ wing . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to imagine that they will get a leg to help the sel@@ f@@ ie British to prevent their energy better , Scotland &apos;s Australia out of the UK - something that they do not want , because most similar types of vi@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot;
&quot; therefore , some such ministers do not even show any hel@@ per ann@@ ot@@ ations , quite in SN@@ P @-@ style , while Britain &apos;s refer@@ en@@ dum@@ b 2017 to accelerate the Bre@@ x@@ it process , susp@@ ected my friend . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a great &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Great Britain has won nothing of its value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how r@@ ally the Fle@@ et Street can be off its costs and what EU sc@@ ep@@ tic the oligar@@ chy of the sp@@ eb@@ ar@@ one is as they were inspired by Tony Ben@@ n inspir@@ ational refer@@ en@@ du@@ ms in 1975 but were not supported by our entrance in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; they can remind themselves weak to Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Opport@@ unity , who made a name as a &quot; EU Ger@@ ade &quot; ban@@ anas in Brussels in the early 90 @-@ s . &quot;
&quot; in all its bl@@ ity , Ed Mili@@ band , who were his enemies . &quot;
&quot; this includes the med@@ ley from the tax @-@ fear@@ ing ch@@ ur@@ ken , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ end @-@ foreigners and the pseu@@ do @-@ @-@ countries , that have most of our major newspapers . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Bl@@ air imag@@ ined for Tony Bl@@ air , but pointed out that when you sit with a hot Gor@@ illa in a box you get better ban@@ anas to distr@@ act him instead of having lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more bl@@ ot@@ ri@@ ans than Bl@@ air himself , when he resi@@ sted himself from Camer@@ ons , for Bl@@ air was rejected the principle of the not adopted Constitution of the EU which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 they opened a back@@ doors . &quot;
the press has never tried it out .
&quot; but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly smile on the back in Westminster - I told him that he is no longer time for me to desp@@ air - seems in danger , N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ nevertheless strategy of the 80 @-@ he years to repeat , a bug then and today . &quot;
&quot; it may take , but he must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa has left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s official position to Europe is - I kind of stress - in the development .
he says that we should stay in a reform@@ ist EU .
&quot; well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional bl@@ an@@ ide trend and the wild ge@@ o @-@ fil@@ med by Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can probably be said yes . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no B@@ enn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on Radio and on TV this week , not admit that Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s appointment of provo@@ king John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell was a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it rem@@ inded me of the 70 @-@ er years , when his old father expressed itself in television to be loyal to his Labour cabinet , without going too far and to lose his cabinet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ dy &apos;s fight was more attractive .
&quot; but to fight to &quot; &quot; under all circumstances &quot; &quot; - B@@ enn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell was said , nor what J@@ C said his fellow cl@@ as@@ ites and members , according to all reports on their appearance on Sunday evening . &quot;
&quot; whatever the tou@@ ching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - news @-@ discipline stays in the age of TV around the clock and above all things in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding of par@@ ano@@ ia and bet@@ ray@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it is true to give Cameron not a free admission ticket for Europe who allow him to hold laboratories support in the refer@@ en@@ dum@@ b for a su@@ bl@@ ity , as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly think so .
&quot; but , Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ity - in line with their B@@ enn@@ ite Bel@@ ager@@ ess economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is not just a question of es@@ oter@@ ic discussion among the left dis@@ si@@ dents , which is a central principle of dog@@ matic dispute . &quot;
&quot; as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities , N@@ ato - Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C will not start campaign for leaving - will be committed to finding foreign diplom@@ ats to find in all a sense of their super@@ visor . &quot;
&quot; why should Paris or Berlin do political capital , they have also sus@@ pic@@ ious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British if this can be anything meaning@@ less ? &quot;
&quot; the United States are already rather disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq , in Libya and Syria , even with a decreased cost of the T@@ ory Government in power , what I was rem@@ inded at the start on Monday which were the British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum . &quot;
experts cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ ze report of Public Health England via e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; alleg@@ ations of a state @-@ financed agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking was created from a meeting of 12 persons , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , told researchers . &quot;
experts who write to the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined in the British Medical Journal ( p@@ hic ) in their report about e @-@ cigar@@ ettes cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed .
&quot; phe published the &quot; &quot; Manifest@@ o &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have ques@@ tioned the lo@@ adability of the data and transferred to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
&quot; a editorial article in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month takes the &quot; &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ ated basis &quot; , &quot; on the p@@ hic his most important conclusion . &quot;
two more researchers write to BM@@ J and asked if the claims are up on stone or sand .
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tro@@ pical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ ewell , said Professor of Clinical epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the proof of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; they said that the public is expected that the statement of p@@ hic that &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes will be around 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; on a detailed revision of reference and mod@@ elling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 persons who were called to develop a model for multi @-@ criteria decision @-@ decision @-@ analysis ( multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria decision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to bring their opinions about the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ hal@@ ted products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ized in a research report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ ewell said that a sponsor of the meeting , a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , the managing director at British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BA@@ T ) will have received for an independent study . &quot;
&quot; he also wrote the references of BA@@ T to the public health in a Sustainability Report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants in the meeting stated to get funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but do not have financing that he received after reports before the Tab@@ ak@@ company Philip Morris International . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for selecting the members of the bodies are not delivered , but these include several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champ@@ ions , some of whom also provide industry financing in the paper . &quot;
some other participants in this session are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the session also took part in the tobacco management of p@@ hic .
&quot; the research work of the group &quot; stands indic@@ ative &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damages of most products at most criteria &quot; , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ ewell . &quot;
&quot; however , no such connections or limitations will be discussed in the p@@ hic report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ ewell said that the alleg@@ ations of p@@ hic that &quot; there has so far no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes serve as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers . &quot;
&quot; prof Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and Well Being at phe , said that the claims by BM@@ J was already responded to in advance . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies on his addi@@ ction .
&quot; all evidence is placed near the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes compared to that , but we continue to study the long @-@ term impact . &quot;
&quot; p@@ hic has the unique obligation to inform the public about what the evidence demonstrates and what is not , especially when there are so much public confusion about relative danger compared to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; nearly 8@@ 0,000 people die each year a disease with reference to smoking , and smoking will cost the national health system two b@@ n £ per year . &quot;
&quot; due to the clear provision of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes does not risk risk , but only a fraction of damage caused by smoking , we fulfil our national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; BBC was to give up East@@ po@@ ders , says former head of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former president of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has told the BBC should stop giving programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice &apos; . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give her right arm &quot; &quot; for hit @-@ shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the Rund@@ funk@@ tive fee should only be used to make the type of programs that will not be broadcast by other UK channels .
&quot; he cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed the BBC that they will be seen publicly against legal programs that probably be seen from a smaller audience , to place in hard um@@ contro@@ versi@@ al time window against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and sen@@ ders as BB@@ C4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC @-@ General Director , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he has tried six years in his time on Channel 4 without success . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs would display or sends , which were also clearly shown from un@@ conventional ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Upper communications Committee under his investigation into the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the Rund@@ funk@@ tions , what I mean - or in the long run does not stop for a good idea , it should not be making production at least for programs that others do not do or commissioned . &quot;
you send The Voice in a first @-@ grade window because they want to achieve the best possible support for their future .
&quot; the idea that none else would show this is a joke , it is ridic@@ ulous , it is natural non@@ sense . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said : &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive financial programs financed , which could also be financed without the subsi@@ dies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions . &quot;
&quot; honestly speaking , other channels would give your right arm to it . &quot;
I paint myself to see how this is supposed to be public @-@ right TV .
I don &apos;t believe that this would dimin@@ ish the BBC ever .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 led , said that the BBC cul@@ d on the hunt for reviews be &quot; because of the ambitions of the people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC give this again , what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his mac@@ th session in Edinburgh in 2003 proposed that the BBC shows how East@@ po@@ ders should sell . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal con@@ ical programmes were to go to BB@@ C4 , but they perform rather the audience , and they can ar@@ gue on their seem@@ ing missions to def@@ use 4 billion £ broad@@ casting fees , &quot; &quot; Well , of course , we have seen all these ob@@ sc@@ ary programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one wanted to ever see .
&quot; for the broad@@ cast@@ ers , Johnson said to the Committee : &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can obtain the best value . &quot;
&quot; of course you think all , we think that for 150 £ per year here is a great value , but for people who is a lot of money for the 150 £ a lot of money , ask myself whether this is true , because they consume not much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 @-@ Chief David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to review their Rei@@ th@@ ian Mission , to form and enter@@ tain . &quot;
&quot; he said , only little from the BBC production would now officially be classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % in radio and it should take part in the publicly @-@ legal television programs in Australia and Canada , and we should inform you of &quot; &quot; inform &quot; , &quot; enligh@@ tened and enter@@ tain . &quot;
&quot; the question of the partnerships said El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like that of the pro@@ ms , from which he said , that only a handful of television was shown , and with the commercial Senate alli@@ ances in order to make everything online . &quot;
&apos;@@ son@@ ogen@@ etics &apos; can control brain cells through sound wave

&quot; the tiny Nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment where they had with sound impul@@ ses that have heard for the human heard of high frequencies in order to be heard , se@@ ven@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the impul@@ ses are working through switching off of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells , which are modified gene@@ tically modified to wear the membrane channels , which respond to ultr@@ as@@ o@@ und . &quot;
further on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said the wor@@ ms shown the power of a new procedure , called Son@@ ogen@@ etics , where ultr@@ as@@ o@@ und can be used to activate a number of brain , cardi@@ ology and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researchers at Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depths of a day , an invasive procedure that gives electrical stim@@ uli into the brain of people in the treatment of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease disease . &quot;
&quot; thread @-@ wor@@ ms usually do not respond to ultr@@ as@@ o@@ und , but Chal@@ as@@ ani reported that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; the b@@ low@@ job , he found out to intensi@@ fy the ultr@@ as@@ o@@ und , which then penet@@ rate into the wor@@ ms . &quot;
the increased ultr@@ as@@ o@@ und operate on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and be found in the membran@@ es of some of the wor@@ ms cells .
&quot; the trans@@ former effect the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells , which they are assigned to such a report Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; to create ultr@@ as@@ o@@ und @-@ controlled n@@ emat@@ ography , changed Chal@@ as@@ ani genetic sp@@ anning the wor@@ ms so that some of their Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on@@ eur@@ on@@ channels carry the TR@@ P @-@ 4 channels . &quot;
&quot; when he uses ultr@@ as@@ o@@ und to the changed creatures , the trans@@ duc@@ tor will be strengthened by the micro@@ bes and transferred into the wor@@ ms , where they turn the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on@@ os . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has several simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ genetic , a ground @-@ breaking tool that enables the scientists to convert neur@@ ons with impul@@ ses of light and turn off . &quot;
but Hal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ ogen@@ etics might have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , which has to be disp@@ at@@ ched on a optical fiber to the desired location in the brain , low y@@ iel@@ ding ultr@@ as@@ o@@ und tissue can occur hur@@ ry and can thus be sent in the brain from above on the sk@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with G@@ enth@@ er@@ ap@@ y and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make temporary human neur@@ ons temporarily sus@@ cep@@ tible to the ultr@@ as@@ o@@ und signal in a clinical attitude for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said this@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and ins@@ ulin gene cells , he added . &quot;

eight golden rules for living in student Residen@@ ces
&quot; eleven years ago I moved as self @-@ forget@@ er 19 @-@ year @-@ old in a student dormitory , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile , which I angry - and to the numerous , long @-@ part complaints about others . &quot;
most of what I learned can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
the default in student Residen@@ ces is from simple nerve r@@ acking up to absolutely fri@@ gh@@ tening .
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to shor@@ ts : people tell where you come about whether and where you &apos;re given Sab@@ bat@@ ching , and why you &apos;re talking to Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in the Ernst , guys , it is just a He@@ fe@@ extr@@ akt h@@ ah@@ aha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - please ask questions and give interest .
&quot; it acts the conversation and helps you to find the people you like in contrast to those with which you would not speak , even if your eyelashes on fire gr@@ ated and these fire extingu@@ ishers . &quot;
let humans become .
&quot; the rooms of people often turn into beverage recipes , film @-@ night venues and communal areas , but they are also the places where people are taking place and under@@ wear their under@@ wear . &quot;
&quot; here@@ after , you do not remember who join with a relationship with a relationship &quot;
reaching a cru@@ de treatment at the university .
&quot; your room should be a refu@@ ge yet many students are a room @-@ to @-@ room @-@ B@@ um@@ mel @-@ culture , which can lead to a friendly and socially and too long friendship . &quot;
&quot; this can be hell @-@ hell for someone who tries to recover . &quot;
&quot; nothing in the culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want , that our friendship continues now , but you must go away to get the energy back I used for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a composite is exhausted from con@@ vivi@@ ality - and send it an SMS instead of kno@@ ck .
speaking pro@@ pos : do it .
a guy in my student inhabitants had the idea that a was not a closed door an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by b@@ aking .
&quot; since you start the Uni at the peak of the Back Man@@ ie , the clo@@ aca &apos;s doors to the doors of people to get less strange than the welcome of 1950 &apos;s years &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I did something to smile . so , and now please smile , if I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
&quot; offer delicious goo@@ dies , is a good way to make friends . &quot;
your ro@@ omm@@ ates are committed to enter@@ tain yourself and will be associated to the end perhaps your face with a delicious surprise .
naturally it depends on whether you are a decent bakery .
&quot; bad mis@@ ery made of fl@@ our , sugar and fat lead to people as@@ leep again when you anchor . &quot;
food to ste@@ al is an ongoing crime of student Residen@@ ces .
&quot; of course , the cl@@ ut@@ ches of chicken is theft , but is it the taking a drop of milk for your tea also ? &quot;
review this with the milk @-@ owner .
&quot; the chances are good that they say to themselves , even when bo@@ il in the internal . &quot;
&quot; when someone takes your stuff , is the anno@@ ying , and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it as my ro@@ ommate , that added their milk a so@@ ap to pun@@ ish di@@ abe@@ es . &quot;
she is now in prison .
they should not make noise from the people from sleep or from working .
&quot; it is not just about being a decent person , but that you are in the tru@@ est sense of the mind to man who are sitting in the glass house . &quot;
&quot; a girl in my corri@@ dor asked her neighbors , whether there is something to ask them , Drum &amp; Bass a little qui@@ eter , for there are 3 o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
they re@@ acted upon it with even more older music .
&quot; when they finally heard at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed two hours to sleep before they pl@@ edges their own music and left their door and ended up to her tri@@ parti@@ tions . &quot;
would it not be romantic if your future spouse would random@@ ly draw to the same student dormitory ?
&quot; conver@@ sely , it would not be so deeply embar@@ ass@@ ing if you need a ro@@ ommate for your future couple of course , to separate them again and then experience it every day and perhaps experience how to pull together all common friends ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart is going to its own paths - but if a hot ro@@ ommate is definitely not your future couple of spouse , try to talk a little reason at least . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment , in which you notice that someone has his key in his not closed room , the boundary between a Ul@@ k and har@@ ass@@ ing is , as it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good meal is funny , but it only takes a moment until he gets to the bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
let us share a valuable and am@@ using lesson through safety - but if you never cr@@ ush somebody &apos;s room with to@@ oth@@ paste and sh@@ amp@@ oo .
&quot; connect your door , and place your key in a glass of water , which you put in free@@ zer - but tick their pos@@ sessions on the ceiling no more than twice a day . &quot;

&quot; thus , for refugees , but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need housing space , but also the only educ@@ ating mother and righteous . &quot;
&quot; I show you how to buy even cheap and well today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the market market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus G@@ ild@@ ner believes to know how fast cheaper living space can be created : it builds in a project terr@@ aced houses for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr G@@ ild@@ ner , many refugees will push for the market market . &quot;
which solution offer you ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : private accommodation in containers or athletes has no sustainability .
for people remain a great part here .
&quot; given the refuge@@ e stro@@ ms , we also need enough space in the next decades . &quot;
a very ban@@ tic , three @-@ stroke maturity is the solution . &quot;
G@@ ild@@ ner : a wh@@ ouses simply needs the least place .
it makes it easier to integrate .
that is different when you inter@@ play the people living in the living area .
&quot; each of the six houses built especially in the pilot project , consists of three dw@@ ell@@ ings each with four asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it may be that many refugees will say , it is back peace , I go back . &quot;
then the houses can be modified easily according to the corresponding needs .
how much is the cost ?
&quot; G@@ ild@@ ner : the price for 160 square meter living space per house , rises to 184 000 Euro , no property . &quot;
this is over@@ man@@ age@@ able .
six months the building took place .
this is appropriate .
do the rules for their plans have complicated ?
&quot; G@@ ild@@ ner : &quot; &quot; right , I have moved my project correctly . &quot;
especially complicated makes it always the dro@@ pping Dam@@ o@@ cle@@ ave special structure and the plac@@ ements of the plac@@ ements .
cre@@ epy .
&quot; it is still set up , who creates in a town@@ house three apartments , needs at least three places . &quot;
only in the cities is missing for this purpose .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their Ro@@ wh@@ ouses project ?
&quot; G@@ ild@@ ner : there were which , which have acc@@ used to me to create lux@@ uries for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
what is definitely not right .
but do you not have exac@@ erb@@ ated the competitors for paid apartments ?
&quot; G@@ ild@@ ner : true , however , we have had a construction boom during the last five years , but built in luxury apartments , which can &apos;t afford to any more . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , also the normal people need housing . &quot;
&quot; not only refugees , but also the only educ@@ ating mother or sc@@ ing@@ e@@ dies . &quot;
I &apos;ll show how to make even cheap and good today .
this is what it is about .

iOS 9 : how to receive the new iPhone OS if Apple @-@ Update is released
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by selecting the adjustment app , on &quot; &quot; cl@@ ever@@ ly &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; software update . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install . &quot;
&quot; some are pushed forward after installing problems , since they received an error message that the &quot; &quot; software update &quot; &quot; was fail@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; to deal with the problem , users will be advised to either wait until the crow@@ ds back or try to update over iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
&quot; this may mean the deletion of apps to create space - but Apple has done this through the sl@@ ing of the updates un@@ prob@@ able . likewise , it will be simpler to do this when you install a special tool , and then install them re @-@ install as soon as the process is completed . &quot;
&quot; it is worth to ensure that your mobile phone is rechar@@ ged during the update or is located close to a charge device , so that the battery is loaded . &quot;
&quot; if the charge is too low , Apple does not let the update continued , as the phone might be switched to half way and that could lead to a breaking @-@ up of the update . &quot;

Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice rims and investing 3@@ 10000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ lowship .
&quot; moreover , a joint action run by Bernd Bor@@ mann , econom@@ ists in Uta Gro@@ m @-@ Sch@@ wart@@ z and As@@ endor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried cab@@ bert . &quot;
in many places in the country there are physicians - As@@ endorf on the other hand took luck : there Dr. Frank Müller on the 1st of October the practice of Fel@@ lowship .
&quot; when Ur@@ sel Fel@@ isti@@ ble goes down to retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich continues his successor in the coming months still at half a place . &quot;
after a construction phase Müller opened the practice on 12 October until then it will invest 3@@ 10000 Euro into the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
&quot; it was sympathy for the first look , when the field got acquainted with Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ y@@ oll who currently graduated with professional education in the Ver@@ den@@ er Hospital and wants to put into practice in practice . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the gar@@ bage could fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ isti@@ ausen and laugh@@ s . &quot;
&quot; when it was , I just got it called . &quot;
the couple of Müller came the idea of operating his own practice in the future in As@@ endorf .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive for us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot;
&quot; we would like to get to know and accompany the families through the years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as a advantage , he can see , soon his own boss . &quot;
and so we got to agree that the gar@@ bage bought the house with practice .
live will still be living in el@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ s@@ sen .
&quot; the two @-@ fold family grandfather Frank Müller also grew up , his medical studies in Hannover , followed them in several medical practi@@ ses as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , N@@ ien@@ burg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; right now he is engaged as a specialist in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed leading emergency physician in the district of Di@@ ep@@ holz and is committed himself to the DR@@ K @-@ willingness of frag@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ s@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; from September 19 , the practice for the new boss will be prepared . &quot;
&quot; during the sur@@ geon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ isti@@ ausen , as a home@@ physician , has specialized his Gat@@ tin Ur@@ sel ( boarding ) on gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; gar@@ bage dump , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle down as home@@ work . &quot;
&quot; end@@ os@@ copy therefore comes out , says the 38 @-@ year of Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll . &quot;
after re@@ modeling the rooms are modern look like .
we will offer more ultr@@ as@@ o@@ und exam@@ inations as well as long @-@ term and endurance @-@ EK@@ GS and need a Interphone more .
furthermore the ED@@ V completely renewed .
&quot; a grant from a total of 5@@ 0,000 euros get the gar@@ bage under a funding program from the county of ( 12@@ ,000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and glad we are , that the practice continues to be guided , empha@@ sizes sperm deb@@ et@@ aker Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; approximately 2000 patients comes according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll each quarter into practice , in the North @-@ German A@@ verage practice , there are about 500 . &quot;
in As@@ endorf there is another house that has been practic@@ able .
a positive tri@@ effect of the practical taking by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ isti@@ ausen in As@@ endorf .
&quot; if no successor was found , it would have also gone . &quot;
&quot; who attended &apos;s gar@@ bage takes , however , look at all in familiar faces : covers the seven medical specialist and the cleaning service from the field of rock . &quot;
&quot; with their departure ends in As@@ endorf a era , after all the medi@@ cs 30 years have practic@@ ed there . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning we only had two rooms , re@@ members Ur@@ sel Fel@@ isti@@ ausen mel@@ ting . &quot;
a little melan@@ chol@@ y they feel after the long time already .
&quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will certainly see many patients for sure , &quot; &quot; says the dormitory . &quot;
her husband is complem@@ ented : &quot; we have a 6000 @-@ square plot .
&quot; so far I have always pressed ahead of gardening , now that could be different . &quot;
in addition the pair has two grand@@ sons and travelled .
Croatia : &quot; we are leaving the refugees through &quot;
&quot; now the border controls are also highly driven to our south @-@ border , &quot; said Interior of Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls at the Hungarian border remain in parallel to this .
&quot; still be clear that everyone who wants to ask for a asylum , this could be &quot; of course &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the supply and safety of people stand in the fore@@ ground .
&quot; clearly , however , that it needs clear signals &quot; , &quot; the minister said . &quot;
&quot; people need to know that we don &apos;t accept limit@@ less migrants , nor of the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia El@@ ves &quot; Cor@@ ri@@ dor &quot; - Slovenia denied
Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wants to continue to travel in Austria and Germany and under certain circumstances Kor@@ ri@@ d@@ ore are er@@ ect for refugees .
&quot; all this , the Interior of Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach but not . &quot;
&quot; Kor@@ ri@@ d@@ ors &apos; idea is &apos; absolutely inakzeptabel , Slovenia , rather , will become the supervision of the border - above all in Hungary - intensi@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the border with Croatia is seen strongly as the outer border of the Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; as the minister stressed , he wants to prove his borders for refugees but not . &quot;
&quot; every EU member must fill its commitments , otherwise the system does not work , &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; like the Croatian government , the first refugees had already been trying to travel in the evening hours to Tuesday , in Eastern Croatian at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d to re @-@ escape to the registration . &quot;
the Croatian police could attack them in the nearby ma@@ is@@ fields .
&quot; according to local media , since then in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik reg@@ ain the police vehicle with new refugees . &quot;
&quot; it is about Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children . &quot;
also lif@@ ebo@@ ats and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; in the coming days , his country with around 4000 refugees , said Interior R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; besides the buses from Pres@@ evo at the Maced@@ onian Serbian border , which has gone through migrants to the Hungarian border , in the direction of Croatia , told Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; however , the government is pun@@ ished in Belgrade &quot; however , that it is whether people can refer to certain routes : &quot; &quot; neither can we do it , nor do we want it , &quot;
&quot; according to the media report , in any case , in the morning , a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Ser@@ b border town of Si@@ d , in the course of the day , further buses would be expected . &quot;
&quot; Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
the in@@ m@@ ates were on the way the whole night from the approximately 500 kilometres to the distant Maced@@ onian border through Serbia .
&quot; we have heard that Hungary has made , so the police have said that we should come here , &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel to Germany by Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
&quot; so now , it could actually make a postpon@@ ed shift of the former Balkan @-@ route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia into a slightly further west @-@ west route . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot;
&quot; Croati@@ a.eu O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had formerly empha@@ sized that his country for the fall of a strong flow of refugees appropriate plans for possible decorations . &quot;
&quot; he did not leave it , but it pointed out that Croatia as non @-@ Schengen member &quot; &quot; have extensive opportunities for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we run strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia is part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have since conquered a good testimony as to the standard of the border controls since 2007 . &quot;
&quot; after the Hungarian border , there are still some 300 refugees firmly behind the Hungarian border fence . &quot;
&quot; according to the media report they could have spent the past night at the border crossing of H@@ org@@ os , who runs after R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
according to the Hungarian authorities the two border cross@@ ings will remain completely locked in h@@ org@@ os and Back@@ i Bre@@ g .
whether the remaining refugees would now wish to travel to Croatian border is still un@@ clear .
&quot; the Serbian inner Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stefan ano@@ vic tried to calm ac@@ tw@@ ins at a local level in H@@ org@@ os , he kept the debates about alternative routes of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed . &quot;
it is currently not about to act very high refuge@@ e camps .
&quot; they could not say whether they would continue their journey over Hungary , Croatia or other country . &quot;
volunteers of migrants at - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refuge@@ e shel@@ ters have already begun to distribute the refugees maps on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border gap between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless : in parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian war , still not vac@@ ated min@@ e@@ fields . &quot;
on Mit@@ tw@@ och@@ re the Croatian police announced that a team of min@@ e@@ fields was sent in the border region .

&quot; Fed@@ Ex results mixed , Fin@@ anz @-@ prospects for 2016 &quot;
&quot; Fed@@ Ex reports the results for the last quarter , and the Li@@ ef@@ er Gig@@ ant stressed its profit from a whole year because of the weak@@ est demand for freight services and higher costs in his land transport service . &quot;
&quot; the company also said that she is planning to establish about 5@@ 5.000 of the season for the holiday today . &quot;
&quot; at this time last year , Fed@@ Ex on that the company wants to adjust the 5@@ 0,000 employees for vacation time . &quot;
the share fell over 2.5 percent in the market trade market 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; Fed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a gain between 10,@@ 40 $ and 10,@@ 90 $ in the financial year that ends in the next May , 20 cent less than in previous forecasts . &quot;
analysis of an@@ alysts expected according to a survey of Fac@@ t@@ set 10,@@ 84 € . &quot;
&quot; the lower outlook comes despite the price increases , an average of 4.8 per cent and on 4 January are effective , and despite higher supplements for soil transpor@@ ts of heavy and big packages that will be charged from November . &quot;
&quot; the company said that however , I expect the result from the previous year due to cost reduction , higher profits and because of growth in online trading . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company brings &quot; solid revenue , if one sees the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade , into consideration . &quot;
&quot; plans for the holiday study were announced a day later than that of the Rival UPS , which plans to adjust 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5.000 extra workers , for example the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter that ended on 31 August , Fed@@ Ex 6@@ 92 million $ , 6 percent more than last year . &quot;
&quot; the earnings per share amoun@@ ted to 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of the acks investment research asked an@@ alysts . &quot;
sales rose by 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of the acks asked an@@ alysts expected to $ 23 billion $ .
&quot; Fed@@ Ex has decreased in recent years a decline in international pri@@ ori@@ ental shipment , which carried the turnover in its unit express @-@ shipping to stagn@@ ation . &quot;
but the boom in the online @-@ shopping has increased the results at Fed@@ Ex ground .
&quot; in the last quarter sales increased by 29 percent in the last quarter , but the operating result was mostly flat due to higher cost of larger packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
&quot; the express @-@ unit compar@@ es higher revenue due to higher prices , while the result is higher because of higher labour costs in the freight business . &quot;
&quot; market trade , approximately an hour before opening , s@@ ank the Fed@@ Ex shares by 3.7 million , or 2,5 percent , on 15@@ 0.15 $ &quot;
they closed on Tuesday with 11 percent loss for year and 17 percent under a record high on 11 June .
&quot; at their most anticipated conference in the year Federal Reserve Str@@ at@@ ements spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot @-@ in @-@ ma@@ ho@@ g@@ any table to decide whether it is time to up@@ lift the first time since almost a decade . &quot;
&quot; dro@@ pping over them at the end of the given , two @-@ store@@ yed Se@@ als , there is a wall picture of the United States . &quot;
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed @-@ chair Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ats and their colleagues to set the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a double order from the congress : maxim@@ izing the US employment and prices here .
&quot; but since the big recession , the F@@ ed leaders have recognised that there is an un@@ postpon@@ ed third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
&quot; and this third mandate might be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too tight to pre@@ di@@ ct it . it will be announced on Thursday , whether the US economy is getting ready by the un@@ preced@@ ented interest rate through the close to zero @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most of the data of the economy show that it is solid , the recent tur@@ mo@@ il in the global financial markets are already fri@@ gh@@ tened to increase these vol@@ ati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal government - and be it also only to one quarter percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the labor market and inflation in first place will be the most important thing you observe , &quot; Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , Ch@@ ef@@ anie , in the Mak@@ ler company Sti@@ ll Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase interest rate , the increased uncertainty around the global market enough justi@@ fication , continues to wait &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed is doing what sec@@ ures themselves to yourself the financial market .
&quot; about half of the economy , which recently inter@@ viewed from Bloom@@ berg have predicted that week &apos;s presentation were predicted . &quot;
&quot; however , the financial markets wait a wait of the F@@ ed , with a key indi@@ an , which indicates only a 30 % chance of increasing . &quot;
&quot; this points to a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless the str@@ apping cut down the blow by offering the promise that a further increase is far away . &quot;
on Tuesday sp@@ rang the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average score about 2@@ 28,@@ 89 points or about 1.1 % at 16.@@ 5@@ 99@@ ,@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; this action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed @-@ policy considers the set in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Ch@@ ef@@ ö@@ ph@@ ol@@ ome at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise , if the F@@ ed would raise the propositions stand at that point , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if it does so , it would have to go very far in their statement to put the financial markets , so that they did not fall into panic . &quot;
&quot; other experts ar@@ gues that would pri@@ c@@ rank the financial markets , because they would insec@@ ure uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act . &quot;
&quot; a month ago the F@@ ed appeared on good ways to increase the set to 0,25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of mon@@ ary conditions which would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ats had said in spring and early summer , in spite of the complaints from liber@@ als , that more economic advance would be required , an increase of the sentence . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of jobs in August slow , the improvement in the labour market in this year was solid . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate rose to 5.4 % last month , the lowest for over seven years and near the level that sees the F@@ ed as full employment . &quot;
pay@@ rolls have shown signs of a recovery .
&quot; and even though inflation was constantly passed under the annual goal of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed Repres@@ ent@@ atives said that the main reason had a temporary impact of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can face higher interest rates and needs it because of tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , Ch@@ ef@@ ö@@ ph@@ ol@@ ome by Pan@@ theon Macro@@ mark@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; but the financial markets around the world reached the end of last month , after China had been valued its currency . &quot;
&quot; the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average fell in May at more than 16 % among its peak , as investors fear@@ ed that a slow@@ down of Chinese economy would become a global growth . &quot;
&quot; this month the market has a little rec@@ u@@ perate , whereby the D@@ ow is now nearly 10 % below the H@@ och from May . &quot;
for the F@@ ed Repres@@ ent@@ atives affect the market uph@@ e@@ av@@ al the complex calculation and when to increase interest .
&quot; if the events would have not occurred on the financial markets and the news on the weaknesses of the Chinese economy in the past few weeks , Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low on U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the U.S. Not@@ en@@ bank . &quot;
&quot; now he pre@@ di@@ ct that she will wait at least a month to better get the effects better . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the U.S. economy , and there is almost no reliable data that describe developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the global economy of the global economy is none of the major concerns , so it should not be involved in decision @-@ making . &quot;
but in the end it has become the F@@ ed Monetary Purchase of the world .
the influence of the central bank in recent years was enormous .
&quot; the mere note of the then leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 that the F@@ ed out its mon@@ et@@ ary expansion &quot; &quot; narrow &quot; &quot; prov@@ oked tur@@ ni@@ tions around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly stra@@ ined , can super@@ v@@ ise the F@@ ed Repres@@ ent@@ atives as well as other central banks and experts to get a better understanding of global economy . &quot;
&quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art as science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary car@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the global strategy for assets of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted that month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over @-@ actions on financial market movements , which with apparently not linked with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
&quot; L@@ acker , hi@@ bit@@ able member of the Federal Open Market Committee , to address a sign , aimed decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia carried the F@@ ed to reduced its benchmark results in three sessions , despite limited recogni@@ zable effects on growth in the U.S. &quot; , &quot; said L@@ acker . &quot;
a year later the F@@ ed Repres@@ ent@@ aries made these cuts .
&quot; the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability only during a difficult crisis as the market in 2008 , as Adam S. Poznań , former member of the Committee on the interest rate of the Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; the recent tur@@ mo@@ il do not come near this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; she certainly don &apos;t want to get into the situation where they &apos;re afraid of an inser@@ tion , because the markets began to rain , &quot; said Poznań , president of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until this is changed , I do not believe that it should be hur@@ ry . &quot;

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ sh@@ ilfe for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany this day .
to prepare you a warm welcome is not without the commitment of inn@@ umer@@ ated volunteers .
&quot; in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da , there are a whole series of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city . &quot;
they belong to them Petra and Klaus Heine .
Petra Heine is with body and soul teacher .
even with their 74 conferences they are still happy to receive .
every Thursday she is doing it in the asylum seek@@ ers at the D@@ ill@@ inger street .

of course the whole of other classes is considered to be at the right school .
Brazilian Pe@@ at@@ ric Association Rio Grande supports nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
Brazilian Association SP@@ RS tries to war@@ n women in sho@@ cking way women about how important good nutrition is during the l@@ ac@@ tation period . it does this with the presentation of images of babies which are around Brü@@ sten suction cups who are painted with portr@@ ay@@ als of un@@ healthy food .
&quot; mother &apos;s milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , the babies provide all nutrients that they need to establish a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are rising to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake around 500 cal@@ ories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research results suggest that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only di@@ ete@@ tic adaptation to be the mothers . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ ine College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet pregnant women can actually protect the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours . &quot;
unfortunately a un@@ healthy diet of the child can have a negative impact .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Spor@@ thalle
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the building contract for the 2.@@ 3 million euros expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof must become fl@@ atter for solar system .
the planning for the long awa@@ ited turn@@ around at the Bern@@ rie@@ der Ruhr area are step by step ahead : in the recent general council meeting the construction carried out was measured without major discussions .
&quot; in other things , the governing body had still decided on a growing legal basis for a &quot; legal &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion from the valid development plan . &quot;
with the &quot; exception &quot; it was the permission for a special form regarding the bad@@ ger .
&quot; accordingly , a &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ p@@ inn@@ ed first and bad@@ ger will be er@@ ected &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; background of the planning is the intended use of the roof surface for solar installations : &quot; &quot; we get a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; said Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; went in turn around the roof incl@@ ination resulting from energetic reasons - other than in the Beb@@ bi plan - below ten degrees . &quot;
the volume of the hall is thus significantly reduced .
&quot; no exemp@@ tion &quot; was therefore necessary , because the development plan on the roof pitch is no &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; - with the Bern@@ rie@@ der council in the rule with fre@@ eing products more restric@@ tive . &quot;
&quot; however , at the turn@@ around construction , it is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; we do not create preced@@ ence , &quot; &quot; St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sports tower at the Sports Center is a community project of the municipality and the SV Bern@@ ried .
around 2.8 million Euros have been calculated .
grants are expected from school and gr@@ ass@@ ing promotion .
&quot; during the next proc@@ ed@@ ural steps , the building contract for the 18 x 36 meters large hall is now presented to the land office . &quot;
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg will be closed before as planned - namely 2016 .
Dr Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) new physician at the hospital Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the station and the majority of employees draw from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this is seeing the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the land which confirmed the coun@@ cils of Andrea Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ White .
&quot; however , a decision on the changes to the super@@ visory boards , and the following Wednesday , 23 September . &quot;
&quot; should the plans are implemented , all those of the 50 employees in the hospital would continue to take part in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg . &quot;
the vast majority of sol@@ les are moving with fishermen and the continued inside station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are present .
&quot; the employees , who can not be offered with Sch@@ ong@@ au , should in Wei@@ l@@ heim an workplace , so Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ White . &quot;
the employees must be informed of the plans .
&quot; triggered the change from Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been Director of Sch@@ ong@@ au Clinic since the beginning of the course of the Sch@@ ong@@ au Clinic and is now moving to a private office in an immediate vicinity of the hospital . &quot;
&quot; the question who is to join the succession , came according to Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; into play , who stated himself to take up the management from 1 October and to change his team after Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au de@@ ac@@ ute this in any case a &quot; &quot; valuation &quot; &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the offer in the field of &quot; internal medicine &quot; , &quot; so Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ white . &quot;
fishermen is a specialist for cardi@@ macher and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized on the inner station on gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ologic diseases .
&quot; in prefer@@ ably for the next two years Fischer with his team , when the Supervisory Board will agree that they will meet both houses , until then next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ y , which has still has 35 beds , in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg , after almost 140 years . &quot;
so far the county seat planned this for 2018 when the currently running rest@@ au@@ ration at the hospital was completed .
&quot; coun@@ cils Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ White , who is also appointed chairman of the Supervisory Board joined Ger@@ ow@@ en , that the house , which is owned by the Federal Council , in the future as an accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; that I close myself . as it continues with the real estate , Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ White could not say , there are several considerations . &quot;
currently there are a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a Tag@@ esp@@ chemical industry .
&quot; what improvement could not happen to us , such an opportunity will not come back , &quot; &quot; Fischer about the Qu@@ asi Moving to the Le@@ ch , who was taken by the staff &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house where fishermen has been working for over 30 years as a boss , I have not given . &quot;
he had been asked by Sch@@ ong@@ au colleagues to assume the position of the director &apos;s director .
&quot; the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was threatened with closure , det@@ ach@@ ments were closed , for example the surgery and the Obst@@ et@@ rics . &quot;

one since Saturday missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palatinate is a non @-@ violent break to the victim .

&quot; as a fr@@ active , one also holds a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , who was indeed the indication of it , and the investig@@ ators leading to find the place of bodies . &quot;
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was missing in the Sunday morning after a visit of a autumn festival in rock@@ enh@@ ausen not how agreed at home after a visit of a autumn morning .
in the pursuit of the young woman received the investig@@ ator initially based on personal objects of the victim .

refugees need accommodations : study war@@ ns in front of housing
the location on the German residential market is ten@@ se .
also more refugees are looking for a paid b@@ ump .
the pressure on the housing markets is growing .
the social housing is faced with a challenge .
the campaign campaigns on the German residential market have long since begun .
&quot; with the incoming refugees and the seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing on a market , which is now over@@ bur@@ dened in many big cities . &quot;
you compete with income @-@ weak citizens about the last paid apartments .
&quot; in order to cover the demand for paid dw@@ ell@@ ings , would have to be built up to 400@@ ,000 new units by 2020 every year . &quot;
this outcome comes a study on behalf of the joint debate &quot; Social housing . &quot;
&quot; for comparison , this year in Germany 26@@ 0,000 units are finished . &quot;
&quot; thus , 14@@ 0.000 apartments . &quot;
&quot; in the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as an asylum seek@@ ers in an original week . &quot;
&quot; many come across the market , and ranks itself in the long sn@@ akes in front of the lease . &quot;
&quot; according to Statisti@@ cians , in the last year , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers grew to rent . &quot;
&quot; however , the negative development of the living market lies not only to the rising refuge@@ e camps . &quot;
the study also makes significant short@@ coming in the housing policy of recent years .
&quot; it puts a hos@@ tility against it , which gets bigger from one year to the year . &quot;
&quot; currently missing in the metro@@ politan areas has already been around 77@@ 0,000 units , indic@@ ted Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot;
many Profession@@ als therefore stayed in major cities in major cities .
&quot; young adults stayed due to the built @-@ in in the market offering un@@ inten@@ tionally longer in &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot; &quot;
in the large cities the number of square metres per cap@@ ita has fallen back in the past years .
to resolve the problem suggests the Alliance &quot; social housing &quot; a rest@@ art .
this is intended to boost new incentives for social housing .
that &apos;s how to disp@@ ens@@ ed the Gre@@ eting Tax Code and the basic tax for funded homes are not exposed .
&quot; additionally , the alliance &apos;s attractive sk@@ ating @-@ setting is necessary . &quot;
the programme for refuge@@ e information of the state bank K@@ f@@ W comes along with towns and municipalities already well .
&quot; a good week after the start was generated by 184 million euros on the eve of 184 million euros , more than half of the available approximately 300 million euros . &quot;
&quot; now , the project could even be bu@@ zz@@ led . &quot;
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia address Cor@@ ri@@ dor
&quot; Hungary is virtually no longer going through , since then enter more refugees from the road over Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb pre@@ aches to provide transit through Slovenia to the North without the bureaucr@@ atic hur@@ d@@ les .
&quot; dangerous is the route , however . &quot;
Croatia wants to engage in the neighbouring Slovenia via the establishment of a corri@@ dor for refugees .
&quot; I talked to the Sloven@@ ian interior courtyard and if it is necessary we will organize a corri@@ dor , &quot; said the Croatian Federal Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria , and is already one of the Schengen area . &quot;
the EU @-@ Country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
&quot; after the withdrawal of the Ser@@ b@@ ish @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to arrive from there to Western Europe . &quot;
&quot; 500 people have come across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports of Croatian television stations R@@ TL . &quot;
Hungary opened its border on the day of refugees .
&quot; new laws that emerged on the same day into force , set the or@@ der@@ ous asylum procedure in Hungary practically super@@ flu@@ ous . &quot;
Croatia wants to pass the refugees .
&quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic explained : &quot; &quot; you can go through , and we prepare for this possibility . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , there are women , children and men who live and want to achieve something . &quot;
but people who do not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police had picked up the first refugees on the border of Serbia on the border of Serbia on the border of Serbia .
&quot; most of the churches have been reported from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they arrived both by bus and taxi to the Serbian border town of Si@@ d .
immediately after her arrival she would have tried to walk on foot over the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Ser@@ b border the refugees did not reach the border .
&quot; for this reason , the border strips are other dangers . there are still sharp min@@ ants from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 1990s . &quot;
Min@@ en@@ sp@@ ans should now quickly create a secure passage .
&quot; after the closing , there is little more refugees arrive after closing the border . &quot;
on Tuesday numbered the police of 366 asc@@ ended people .
shortly before the end of the door on Monday it had been 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian legislation stages the overcoming and defects of the border za@@ ars as a crime .
the sub @-@ Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eged will therefore not be returned to 35 criminal proceedings .
the susp@@ ected Liability Act of up to five years and the deport@@ ations from the country .
&quot; according to the immigration office , on Tuesday we took the newly set up in the limit &quot; Tran@@ se@@ ons &quot; in a total of 94 kinder@@ gart@@ ens , of which almost all - 93 - are on the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
under the applicants are 13 families with small children and two elderly people .
at the Mit@@ tw@@ och@@ tomorrow there were still 40 refugees .
&quot; however , there is no longer a view to get in Hungary Asy@@ l . &quot;
&quot; in the following opinion , Serbia is a &quot; safe third country . &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers should be ported there .
&quot; in front of the &quot; &quot; transit @-@ zone &quot; &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke gathered together only a few hundred refugees . &quot;
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke started workers began to dream .
&quot; they gathered the gar@@ bage , which had left the ti@@ the thousands of people over the past few weeks at the road@@ side . &quot;
pl@@ ywood were can@@ cel@@ ed and one of the recording camp in the border town was rebuilt .
&quot; in order to achieve this structure , nobody wanted to express itself . &quot;
Austria after the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary are only a few refugees .
the country also has reinforced its border controls .
&quot; around 20,000 migrants stood still abroad , but still in the country . &quot;
in Salzburg around 1400 people are waiting for further trip to Germany .
traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning to the German authorities .
in free@@ ass@@ ing regularly smaller groups of refugees have met on foot .
Mayor &apos;s gun &quot; Stret@@ ched &quot; over the border
&quot; we were busy following the bridge to the bridge on Sunday with the Au@@ fr@@ aming , when suddenly ten people were standing by traveling @-@ off@@ s at the entrance of the camp , &quot; says Wer@@ n@@ st@@ eins Mayor Alois Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; tourists , they wanted to move by train to Passau . &quot;
&quot; but in Germany on Sunday but because of the refuge@@ e stream travel with Austria had stopped for them , for her in Wer@@ n@@ stein , he was immediately bound up his help and bri@@ g@@ ade together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into Passau . &quot;
&quot; before , we made the un@@ hop@@ ed guests only once , with pri@@ eve and drinks . &quot;
&quot; we said , we will take her by car to Passau . &quot;
&quot; that of course was a matter of course for us , &quot; the town@@ ship in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let it take a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; this has been very happy , &quot; this city . &quot;
&quot; the disabled links were dropped on Sunday evening in Wels from an ICE in a regional move towards Passau , to take it after the short notice , that the railway traffic to Germany was postpon@@ ed , but still via the border . &quot;
&quot; however , the regional train has been ab@@ sent to the Inn before the border in Wer@@ n@@ stein . &quot;
in Wer@@ n@@ stein the cross @-@ border is generally high in the course .
the link @-@ can association with the Bav@@ arian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ able when previously a double @-@ bridge sporty - organized by the Union Wer@@ n@@ stein and Bayern from Neu@@ kirchen .
&quot; that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sends more Z@@ ig@@ nia to ourselves , is a logical result of a seem@@ less sacred policy : &quot;
&quot; instead of helping in the camp of pension immediately at the establishment of structures , humanity has passed our Federal Chancellor , officially , and publicly at the position of the Hungarian government in the Dun@@ es of National Socialism . &quot;
&quot; suffering from this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now faced in the bor@@ der@@ lands with cha@@ otic conditions . &quot;
&quot; the refugees you have to find that the &quot; &quot; pra@@ ised land &quot; , &quot; which they are invited and welcome , nothing but another refuge@@ e camp . &quot;
&quot; it will be a great challenge , given the continuing flow currents and the approaching winter , with us decent fe@@ ats for Refu@@ elling . &quot;
&quot; and there will be a still greater - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
&quot; Konrad in search of 3@@ 5.000 hi@@ ber@@ nation Quar@@ ry , &quot;
Konrad has all hands full of refugees with the refuge@@ e guarantee .
Christian Konrad is the fact that his word has weight .
the government has used the former mighty Rai@@ ff@@ eisen @-@ Ban@@ ker to make lod@@ g@@ ings for the thousand refugees .
the chaos in the first investigations into Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got a grip on .
&quot; we have no homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported of his first success . &quot;
&quot; the accommodation of 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday , was without great tur@@ mo@@ il , &quot; Konrad and pra@@ ised the organizational &quot; master performance . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the State Department spoke on the situation of a &quot; &quot; scrat@@ chy situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; altogether , Konrad with a requirement of 8@@ 5,000 quar@@ ations in the second year . &quot;
&quot; in order to meet the number , you must be found 3@@ 5.000 accommodations in the next weeks - 20,000 are the countries provide , 15.@@ 000 of the covenant . &quot;
&quot; should it be more refugees , we can create it . &quot;
&quot; but there is no barrel without soil &quot; , &quot; Konrad . &quot;
with the Länder he has already held talks .
&quot; they had raised him , even for the coming refugees lod@@ g@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Austria it works well , &quot; said Ferry Ma@@ ier . &quot;
the former VP @-@ al@@ atar supports Konrad .
tomorrow it will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born to be clear@@ ed as the church will help .
&quot; great expectations sets the Asyl@@ um Co@@ ordin@@ ator , even into the OR@@ F Action Plan &quot; as we are . &quot;
on the platform private people can provide uncomplicated accommodation .
&quot; in addition , one hopes for hotels that will be empty during winter . &quot;
Konrad and Ma@@ ier critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as a &quot; very high . &quot;
&quot; in emer@@ gen@@ cies , it could not be that accommodation owners have to respect a certain amount of hand @-@ ke@@ eper or size of the se@@ frank@@ ness . &quot;
for a temporary time would have to be &quot; staves . &quot;
&quot; that he was more successful in contrast to the treas@@ ury in keeping , based on Konrad with his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am an older gentl@@ eman , which one cannot say without further into the face of the fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;
per@@ su@@ asi@@ veness be his most important weapon .
&quot; Konrad and Ma@@ ier , the Republic does not cause any cost , as they explained . &quot;
their staff will want to increase them three to four .
the own neighbourhood of accommodation was not yet successful .
Konrad wanted to place a container at the Steph@@ an@@ splatz in Munich office .
yet there are obviously problems with the permission .
Linz calls for better distribution
&quot; pre @-@ inaugur@@ ated , no opening of city sports halls and other buildings like Tips @-@ Arena and design Center for accommodation of refugees is planning the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; this is not the moment that the person affected has to place without these measures , says Mayor Klaus L@@ ug@@ er ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; however , for the emergency , further locations should be checked to their fitness . &quot;
criticism against the chef at the distribution of refugees within the federal state .
other areas must make their contribution here .
&quot; elevation above @-@ sea @-@ level : &quot; &quot; borders are not her@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a longer telephone line with the Bav@@ arian Prime Minister Horst The@@ o@@ fer ( C@@ SU ) has established the govern@@ or Josef P@@ it@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday which further procedures in the refuge@@ e query .
&quot; above sea @-@ level , it has reas@@ sured that the German borders are not cur@@ ated . &quot;
the passing travel of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
&quot; however , it now yield the corresponding border controls . &quot;
&quot; even with refugees in Germany , I will not give it any more . &quot;
but the c@@ itation would however be associated with regular journeys to Germany .
&quot; from other EU member states , P@@ ag@@ inger took once more reinforced solidarity in the refugees . &quot;
&quot; that now Austria once again passed to his borders , he is a logical consequence for P@@ ühr@@ inger &quot; &quot; from the procedure of the Germans . &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
the General Assembly of the &quot; New Wer@@ ft &quot; in the Lin@@ zer Industrial line is officially completed .
&quot; in four of the six store@@ ys of the office and production building the listed IT Group S &amp; T , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology area . &quot;
&quot; in IT , the clever heads are our raw materials - and we have to try that they work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T @-@ Chief of Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
he could imagine to invest in start@@ up firms of the New Wer@@ ft and later also to act as qui@@ ver .
&quot; even from the beginning , S &amp; T he wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - of which , Nieder@@ haus@@ er seems some promises : &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a question of time . &quot;
&quot; 1.7 million euros have been invested by S &amp; T in the location , 3.7 million euros from the Tech@@ center , which is one third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is adjustable from Linz AG for 60 years along S &amp; T and Tech@@ center .
&quot; 30 per cent of the 27@@ 00 square of resi@@ dual space in the building are already rented , for more than 40 percent there are requests . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened second business in the Arctic

this project had to shed the 49 @-@ year of the Li@@ oni Per@@ oni in the di@@ ben@@ markt @-@ arc@@ ade short @-@ hand : finally she has now become more w@@ aking in the form of a further business location .
&quot; in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop across from the business , in which they are sold amongst others bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and ro@@ wers of various manufacturers , now all inver@@ ts for hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are from 75 Euro to . &quot;
larger pockets and accessories cost up to 500 Euros .
since yesterday the new shop is in operation .
&quot; previously , several weeks has been converted . &quot;
&quot; but I have long over@@ lay if I want to open a store , &quot; says Bre@@ it . &quot;
&quot; among other things , the decision was also among other things that the Fur@@ la producers who are in Bologna at home , from the idea of an own location , where only their hand@@ bags are being sold out . &quot;
&quot; we are the pi@@ pers in the Greater Linz who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who has even Italian roots . &quot;
your fashion interest has given Bre@@ it from her mother to the cradle .
&quot; ch@@ opped off the most , if something develops and I can show new trends at high prices . &quot;
why so many woman in the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in decoration is also unable to answer the no@@ o@@ woman with last security .
maybe it is because a beautiful bag is used for each out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ul@@ l@@ jes@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the fal@@ si@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place whose inhabitants are called .
this property combines maneu@@ ver also with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become president .
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for clean .
&quot; whether he expresses himself or xen@@ opho@@ bic , journalists , or knowledge in the international crisis policy - the applic@@ ant for the US presidential system could be strongly encouraged . &quot;
and cutting well with it .
&quot; this is also registered in the pf@@ alz region , where the grand@@ parents come from the real estate of gross . &quot;
the New Yorker with the old @-@ term is many in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf at the Wine Road .
man@@ cher in the 1200 @-@ inhabitants @-@ site is related over -@@ zig corners with it .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palatinate : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in the &quot; &quot; campaign &quot; &quot; mode . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ urban Simone Wen@@ del turned a film about Tru@@ mp .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about its aim to become the most powerful man of the world ?
&quot; I think these are somehow exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their kne@@ es way , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ urban area has a am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous spra@@ yers to which besides Tru@@ mp also the ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts .
&quot; Tru@@ mp who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; kings of K@@ all@@ city &quot; ( 2014 ) also to words - so with the statement that he would certainly also succeed if he would live in K@@ all@@ town . &quot;
&quot; to the king of the heart , he did not put it there . &quot;
&quot; though there are respect for the performance of the family , but also ten@@ der@@ ive the opinion that Tru@@ mp &quot; is a bit a big mouth , &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; due to the nickname , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the Vic@@ inity &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ul@@ l@@ jes@@ macher &quot; - at high @-@ German : the in@@ ator , says it . &quot;
Tru@@ mp is thus created from the village of Inn@@ er .
&quot; the Tru@@ mp &apos;s success story began 1885 , when the later grand@@ si@@ re emig@@ rated , and in the US opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers . &quot;
corner@@ stone of the real estate company were first real estate sales in New York .
&quot; but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy , your desire to return to the country to return to the Bav@@ arian State , to which the Palatinate was then . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tru@@ mp because he once said without permission was the director of the Institut für pf@@ alz history and volunteer , Roland Paul , to the film start . &quot;
Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of a &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this stands in contrast to the with@@ drawn statements of the surname .
he repeatedly talked to about Mexican immigrants in the US and called the construction of an border @-@ wall to det@@ ain illegal immigrants .
&quot; just as the pol@@ tor@@ so , this is not so person@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative Tru@@ mp@@ s ( &quot; Die O@@ ma was a new@@ born Tru@@ mp , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
the win@@ eg@@ rower in retirement provides the Americans rather dist@@ ancing . &quot; he is always so infl@@ ated .
believe he thinks that Tru@@ mp is coming ?
&quot; I can not imagine , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he never did around K@@ all@@ city . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the pension pal@@ ac@@ ic Ver@@ on@@ ika Sch@@ r@@ amm is mentioned as man@@ cher K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , that a desc@@ endant of the Heinz with a visit is something for the F@@ athers , which was generally well sto@@ cked . &quot;
&quot; I cannot imagine anymore by Donald &apos;s , says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; they bo@@ oth@@ s it better if he does not throw the choice , because &quot; the has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had the days of his grandfather in the US had had such a coll@@ ages , as if he had , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ den@@ ser Sarah B@@ üh@@ ler . &quot;
and as President ?
&quot; my president is not it , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; and : &quot; &quot; the grapes become more mature also without the President Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; Wend@@ els Film , for the Tru@@ mp length was inter@@ viewed , have 12 000 members , also in the USA awak@@ ens the interest . &quot;

&quot; Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ k@@ inson , after Can@@ ber@@ ra , to report on the loss of the leaders of the Liber@@ als , but it did not have large shi@@ fts in the ratings for Today . &quot;
&quot; the breakfast show of Nine was broad@@ cast@@ ed by the federal capital , as Mal@@ col@@ m turn@@ out for the overthrow of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t . &quot;
&quot; the Riv@@ ale Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Saman@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ days , also stuck in London as part of a one @-@ week series of international broad@@ casts , to which also Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cun . &quot;
&quot; this disadvantage of the resistance seemed to be played for Australian TV audience , because Sun@@ rise reached average 39@@ ,000 spect@@ ators in the five capitals compared to today today 33@@ 9.@@ 000 . &quot;
&quot; today today , today shows a slight increase in the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17.@@ 000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number stayed behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;
today today the gap to Sun@@ rise has been closed in the last few months .
&quot; in August today reached on 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 33@@ 0.000 of Sun@@ rise . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the distance between 40.@@ 000 and 5@@ 0,000 . &quot;
&quot; so far in September Sun@@ rise is at an average of 34@@ 9.@@ 000 spect@@ ators about 3@@ 14.@@ 000 at Today . &quot;
this is the most interesting thing happens every morning .

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama of a recently bet@@ we@@ v@@ ous father , who closes himself with his two children on the shores of New Zealand , achieved a very impressive number of 1,@@ 219 million spect@@ ators . &quot;
critics were wonder@@ ing if Thom@@ son got a hit @-@ show Solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
the result of yesterday evening rep@@ lied with a clear &apos; yes . &apos;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven stayed strong with 1.@@ 136 million spect@@ ators and hit slightly The Block ( 8@@ 38.@@ 000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 5.@@ 30 p.m. ) of the new Quiz show , hosted by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ e@@ fe , an average of 44@@ 6.000 spect@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30 p.m. to 18 : 00 ) sp@@ rang up to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spect@@ ators - enough for a small victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gui@@ res Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; on Saturday evening the first half hour from The Ch@@ ase Australia 5@@ 20,000 spect@@ ators , and in the second half an hour , 7@@ 20,000 . &quot;
&quot; hot @-@ Se@@ at an average 6@@ 20,000 . &quot;
&quot; the drop in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will also be confident , that Hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately be en@@ forced at 17 : 30 . &quot;

the last three qualities are in fact : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
un@@ vei@@ led ? ...
&quot; Lana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably have obviously got to know who The Bachelor wins . &quot;
&quot; the woman , finally lan@@ ed by Sam Wood in The Bachelor &apos;s degree , was covered in greatest secrecy . &quot;
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one that has received the last Rose .
&quot; but when we were by Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and Lana Je@@ av@@ ons b@@ lows on the day before coming three two , you may have acci@@ dentally given an indication that who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood keeps his lips until the finale on Thursday .
&quot; all three women have left themselves in this ly@@ rical way , why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humor , ambi@@ tion , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they like to be in his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is ques@@ tioned &quot; If not you , who was supposed to get W@@ oods last Rose ? &quot; , &quot; their answers to the gam@@ bling won , who gained the heart of the Bachelor &apos;s . &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both fast - except itself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner in wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had one simple relationship with each other from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and ( Sar@@ Allah ) and Sam@@ ies energies noticed that they were quite compatible , and I thought it all over the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah is with both feet on Earth , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with it , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added . &quot;
&quot; I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry . &quot;
you will feel pleasant and comfortable together .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood were well suited as a couple .
&quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the hous@@ cur@@ se last week did make her clear that wood &quot; &quot; could be a &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now ready to put on him , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked , who wood to choose , if not they , there it was pu@@ zz@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; I do not know if I can say that , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girls alike - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and Lana .
&quot; the Bachelor &apos;s Bachelor will be scre@@ ened on Wednesday , 19 : 30 p.m. , on Ten . &quot;
originally released as Sarah &apos;s first choice for Sam Wood ?
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
&quot; Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the US - and there were many other teams , who sent inquiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year . &quot;
&quot; but Hay@@ ne , the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a smart choice . &quot;
&quot; some trainers would have banned Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game as he lost a bar@@ angel , as it did the Aus@@ sie Rug@@ by @-@ League conversion to his first pun@@ t return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota . &quot;
&quot; but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his man and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a Pun@@ t Return , and to the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush . &quot;
Tom@@ s@@ ula will still showed its true face in the locker room according to the game .
&quot; instead of using his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team by the mill , he encouraged them . &quot;
Tom@@ s@@ ula reinforced Hay@@ ne also public during his press conference in accordance with the game .
&quot; the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ por@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was encouraged by special team teams , Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who ri@@ ke him to forget his burnt tor@@ n and to take care of the next game . &quot;
&quot; Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t in a pun@@ t , who was restored in the first game quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vik@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian poems for his N@@ FL debut . &quot;
&quot; Hay@@ ne left the playing field and spoke later to the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he would not imagine any worse start into his N@@ FL career . &quot;
&quot; that was a thing that now occurs , you just takes care of the next game , and that &apos;s it &quot; , &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot;
Hay@@ ne disgu@@ ised the Schn@@ itzer with his Orig@@ in Deb@@ ü@@ t at that time in 2007 when a passport led at his own in @-@ Go@@ al area to a Tr@@ y for Queens@@ land .
&quot; overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;

&quot; the free voters are demanding high refuge@@ e camps , because of the high refuge@@ e camps receive the attitude of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Mr Ai@@ v@@ anger , Hubert Ai@@ v@@ anger war@@ ned at the beginning of the FW @-@ autumn , before a severe crisis at Bay@@ erns schools , if there is a minimum of 1,000 additional teachers in order to keep schools before the coll@@ aps &quot; , &quot; said Ai@@ v@@ anger . &quot;
&quot; otherwise we will get transi@@ tions in the Bav@@ arian education system . &quot;
the landscape @-@ day group of open voters will be conven@@ ed until Friday in the Commun@@ e .
&quot; actually , there were absolutely other main topics . &quot;
&quot; however , the record number of refugees also domin@@ ates the Free voters meeting . &quot;
&quot; of course , the subject of asylum is transferred to the cl@@ auses , &quot; said Ai@@ v@@ anger . &quot;
Ai@@ v@@ anger invited the establishment of UN protective zones for refugees in Syria , such as it had been during the Yugoslavia wars in the n@@ ine@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; so it is not going on , we have to adapt to the causes &quot; , &quot; said the Free voters &apos;s boss . &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to push the free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; therefore Ai@@ v@@ anger also called more staff for the dishes that are responsible for asylum seek@@ ers : &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; &quot; Ai@@ v@@ anger . &quot;
&quot; FW @-@ chief has critic@@ ised that multiple states are not consistent : &quot; we have covered the nationwide standards of the Bundesländer . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria p@@ ens from , others not . &quot;
&quot; since we have to become more confident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , the national policy in meg@@ al@@ ot town is not supposed to fall under the table . &quot;
a long @-@ term steady hand remains on the agenda : the policy of education .
&quot; for the new school year , Mini@@ stries Ludwig Sp@@ a@@ en@@ le ( C@@ SU ) launched the pilot @-@ stage of three to four years in which a extension of the gymn@@ asi@@ tic intermediate level has been tested for three to four years - in the result it takes another nine years to finish . &quot;
but this is not far enough .
&quot; the theme of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; said the FW @-@ Chief . &quot;
we are calling for the freedom of freedom of the gymn@@ asi@@ es who want it .
free travel at G@@ 9 everywhere where it is desired .

4 people killed after polic@@ emen rubber stamp on prot@@ esters in Nepal shoot
&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal , after the police are shot in a crowd making the proposed new constitution , said a official on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke out at the ma@@ ho@@ eve of the district Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi , about 175 miles west of the capital city Kathmandu . &quot;
&quot; Bis@@ hn@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad Dh@@ ak@@ al , senior district , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , with some of them stones and ar@@ bom@@ bs were war@@ ned . &quot;
Mr Dh@@ ak@@ al said the police have inserted Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and then rolled into the air before they reg@@ ained on rubber feet .
&quot; twenty polic@@ emen and five civilians were in@@ ju@@ red , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the rubber @-@ fin bu@@ cket , of which is known that they can kill , but that traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , apparently a so high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the examination was the last in weeks of violent protest in Nepal as southern levels , where members of the ethnic group of M@@ adh@@ esi say that new provinces in the proposed new Constitution would be formed to reduce their political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in the western Nepal by the ethnic group of the Th@@ arus that wish to have their own state .

coverage of Y@@ as@@ me@@ en Ab@@ ut@@ al@@ eb ; editing by Christian Pl@@ um@@ b
for easily overweight di@@ abe@@ tics can be useful for weight loss .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for easily overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years after a new study .
&quot; it is still too early to say whether easily overweight people with diabetes according to weight loss surgery is longer than those that do not receive surgical treatments . &quot;
&quot; the Ster@@ ling data need a long time to show something &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of the weight loss surgery that wrote a editorial article about the new study in J@@ ama Surgery . &quot;
&quot; weight loss operations or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absor@@ b food .
&quot; over the years Adi@@ pos@@ al operations have proved efficient in the treatment of type @-@ 2 @-@ diabetes as well , but most studies have been conducted by people who are inhi@@ bits with a Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain level of weight regarding size , is considered normal between 18,@@ 5 and 24,@@ 9 . &quot;
BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; the researchers used by Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data that they have been collected since 2007 in a study and compare two types of obesity surgery - Mag@@ en@@ b@@ yp@@ ass and Mag@@ en@@ schl@@ itation - for medical treatments for type 2 @-@ diabetes with people who were easily overweight . &quot;
&quot; the average BM@@ I among those who sub@@ mits to this operation , s@@ ank from 31 to 24,@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the BM@@ I remained with those that non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments were roughly equal to 29 . &quot;
&quot; under those who sub@@ mits to a surgical procedure , rede@@ emed at 36 % of the diabetes disease , and at 28 % in part . &quot;
&quot; in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , in comparison with diabetes , diabetes fully occurs only by one percent and in part in only about two percent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results were obtained in the checks of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the &quot; &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; generally better in the &quot; &quot; surgical &apos; group , &quot; the authors found out . &quot;
the researchers also ski@@ ers the patient &apos;s blood levels of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c who reflects the blood sugar levels in the course of time .
Hä@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c is best held under 7 per cent to write the researchers .
&quot; after the surgery , the average hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin , A@@ 1@@ c level of around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , in the medical therapy group it remained stable at about 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as you reflected in the enhanced gh@@ ty of A@@ 1@@ c level - decreased not the mort@@ ality in five years , so the leading researchers Dr chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also promised average results in the two types of the surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year the b@@ yp@@ ass surgery group has lost more weight ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reached greater returns in BM@@ I ( 7,@@ 4 vs. 5.1 ) and Hem@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.7 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study does not show a survival part of surgery after five years , there are evidence from a study of serious people in Sweden , that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study , it was in fat men who under@@ went to Adi@@ pos@@ as surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patient , Black@@ stone , it was so@@ othing for persons with a BM@@ I below 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; that is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation in this lower BM@@ I group is lower , without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously as soon as the patient lies with its BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we are waiting too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have firm their bodies with obesity and diabetes , is a revers@@ al really hard . &quot;
love story takes place in the H@@ uns@@ r@@ ück

&quot; in addition to the love story , the novel is likely to be interesting for H@@ uns@@ r@@ er reader , for it takes place in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages . &quot;

&quot; it &apos;s impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot;
&quot; Europe cannot take up all the refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refuge@@ e crisis in the Middle East begins . &quot;
the Ti@@ be@@ tical Buddh@@ ist guide called on to end the violence in the countries of refugees .
the Dalai Lama said the problem of en@@ during refuge@@ e crisis at the beginning of his ten day visit in the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford where he dedicated to ethics .
he requested that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be put forward against the interests of each nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the reaction of the western European countries is ad@@ mi@@ red to the refuge@@ e crisis , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama and Austrian approaches to overcome the crisis , he stressed that there is only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions like a real peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; he said . &quot;
ultimately we must think about how the killing has decreased in their countries .
we need to reduce the use of force .
&quot; the use of force has never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama said the problem of violence and commented on George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of September 11 and presented that the non @-@ violent reaction of the US pushed a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my sympathy in a letter to President Bush and I said to him , the way to solving this problem lies in non@@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence , and that has un@@ wa@@ ited consequences , &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
four @-@ fold rise of intake of hand@@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the last 4 years
&quot; tox@@ ic@@ control centers in the US report about an almost 400 % increase in number of children under twelve years , which are strongly using alcoholic dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , clim@@ bed the cases of income from hand inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years , the tox@@ at@@ control centers , from 3,@@ 266 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are becoming more common in these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go out in the note , &quot; &quot; Lop@@ ez CN@@ N said . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants shor@@ tens , while some are doing to impress their friends , or because of a Mut@@ asting with social media . &quot;
to show videos on YouTube such as young dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants would be able to drink only because of a cheap experience .
young@@ sters have suppos@@ edly mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant with soft mou@@ th@@ wash to get a harder drink .
younger children can be shot from attractive scents of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are par@@ c@@ mp@@ ed .
&quot; dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange trees that are very appealing to children . &quot;
hand san@@ iti@@ zer contains somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
particularly in small children can already perform a few guns for alcohol addi@@ c@@ tion@@ aries .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the Gi@@ ft@@ not@@ ch Hospital in the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the sender Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you would not let &apos;s p@@ si@@ p whis@@ ky , but men let these hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in reach of children , and if children come to it , then it &apos;s a quick way to consume much alcohol . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ ij@@ ah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year girl who had recently taken four sy@@ ring@@ es of after straw@@ berry du@@ mb@@ al in the school was brought into an emergency treatment .
&quot; your blood @-@ concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold , which is considered by an adult in law , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , a emergency doctor who treated them in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ ij@@ ah l@@ all@@ ten their words and was not able to go than they anchor in the emergency .
&quot; doctors w@@ aged over night in a separate child hospital on signs of brain trau@@ ma , since the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had ended the head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey said . &quot;
&quot; this was very wor@@ ris@@ ome , &quot; said Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ ahu mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been deadly for my child .
Lop@@ ez has advised parents and teachers to use soft products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and storage dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
over alcohol det@@ oxi@@ fication were also associated with dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with death cases .
&quot; in 2013 two women in Ontario Women after the swal@@ lowing of wall dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , which will be a toxic , un@@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; health authorities susp@@ ected that the product meth@@ anol was contained , a deadly solution , instead of eth@@ anol , which is not@@ ated as a drug . &quot;

&quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an Ambassador for Ajax , said , &quot; In Holland they show no highlights of the Celtic games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .

now we want to come out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know it is very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happened . &quot;
we feel this is exactly the same - but we must continue .
&quot; we really need the support provided by Celtic , because the player is better . &quot;

why I will be an exposure to O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
&quot; somewhat later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will look like a man to be put to death . &quot;
&quot; when it happens , and I hope that it is not happening , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery at the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ sy is executed by the tox@@ ins . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
&quot; the invitation was made for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I vote . &quot;
&quot; when the day near@@ er , I began to fear . &quot;
&quot; so , why should I do it ? &quot;
&quot; to vote , because I thought it would be a great way to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see in the USA , and since more applications are available as places nowadays , an mak@@ ab@@ ere lot@@ tery is taking place to decide who is chosen . &quot;
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media channels from 12 to 5 .
&quot; who is selected , who will be reading it em@@ otive . &quot;
I cannot do that .
I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps &apos;s narrow friend with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone data and a fort@@ nigh@@ tly hours of visit .
I like the guy .
&quot; we often lau@@ gh so much , if we speak . &quot;
&quot; the det@@ ention authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and take a pen to take on what I see . &quot;
I just need to try to remember all the details .
&quot; a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma acc@@ used me to give me on Twitter , my im@@ parti@@ ality . &quot;
here is the lesson .
&quot; tell the story of the people , as he wants , and you will receive access . &quot;
I describe myself with it .
&quot; they indicate that they could have better form@@ ulate , but it still thinks that it is wrong what I do . &quot;
Richard Glos@@ s@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I would not do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he may remove me from his list of witnesses .
but he wants that an international re@@ por@@ ter is present to write there .
&quot; if he dies , he thinks that the public relations of the movement will help against the death penalty . &quot;
Kim Bell@@ y@@ ware , a re@@ por@@ ter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of pod@@ casts I have made . &quot;
I will not go back to all details here .
I can not say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ s@@ p is in@@ no@@ cent .
his actions after the ass@@ ass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would be guilty to be a benefici@@ ary of de@@ ed .
yet I believe that a strong probability is that he is not guilty of the murder .
I think there is not enough evidence to justify a death .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from that perspective I will see him dying .
I can not claim to be truly objective .
there will be other re@@ por@@ ters that you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man dying man dying .
man after hum@@ id police persec@@ utions translated from the C@@ anning River
&quot; the p@@ anning V@@ ale Pol@@ ishing is dry dry , when he sp@@ ake the man from the p@@ anning river . &quot;
&quot; an attempt of a man of Per@@ th to hang down the police was un@@ successful when he looked after the submitted and su@@ mp@@ ed water , just a few meters from a police be@@ am@@ ten away , which tried to return it gently to return to the banks . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was launched on Tuesday to a house @-@ building case in Beck@@ enh@@ am .
&quot; when they discovered the susp@@ ects , he tried to escape them towards C@@ anning River . &quot;
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in the wat@@ ering and said &apos; I am not out , come and cher@@ ish me , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; con@@ dense Sal@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his Uni@@ form wet , therefore he turned out a reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; &quot; A good polic@@ eman . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said senior ser@@ ge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
Championships @-@ soccer player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .

Peter Moo@@ dy claims that st@@ ew@@ ards tried to head him out and threat@@ ens to end the racing sport
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that st@@ ew@@ ards of Racing Victoria have tried to install a sp@@ y in his st@@ ables in his st@@ ables and won the race immediately .
&quot; he moved to the st@@ ew@@ ards and the integrity division of Racing Victoria and claimed that she had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai due to a racing day treatment , the last stra@@ w on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Fair@@ fax said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tries to do what best for the racing sport and he found himself in difficult conditions while talking about the positive cob@@ alt T@@ up@@ fer@@ a at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain . &quot;
&quot; he had returned 18 months due to the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age submission , and did not want to see that it is &quot; &quot; see how to sophisticated grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had before , nothing to say about it , and I have long spoken to eat , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything is coming out at once , &quot; said m@@ oo@@ dy . &quot;
they know that there are continuing .
&quot; sometimes one has to react , and you have to live with the consequences and I have to live with it what I said . &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I want to go about the main deal , and I want to think that my owners think I try my best for her . &quot;
&quot; if they start thinking , I do not do that , then I should not be a trainer . &quot;
I have to think carefully what I do with my license .
&quot; previously , Moo@@ dy had passed the bom@@ b in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the integral department had tried to track his barn . &quot;
&quot; before eigh@@ teen months ago Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stew@@ art in a room with a man - I will ren@@ oun@@ ce information about what I do within my st@@ alls , &quot; said m@@ oo@@ dy on Rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
they apparently believe that I am a che@@ at .
&quot; if that is the case , they should certainly believe in their n@@ oses , because they are trying to grip onto me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , eh@@ em . Chairman of the RV@@ L , David Moo@@ dy , acting president of the RV@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of RV@@ L , were aware of this time and are still today . &quot;
should I bring this to the view that it is personally created ?
&quot; follow Route L , and makes people out of trainers who are responsible for what is going on in the industry ? &quot;
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe the people think there I am .
&quot; perhaps they must take my license and come up with me , and I don &apos;t have any doubt that what I say , they will now think about it . &quot;
&quot; but I now arrived at the point where I am no matter , and that makes me sad . &quot;
this really makes me sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the yo@@ str@@ ations of the Train@@ ers have assembled with the long lasting Kob@@ alt investigation into Li@@ dar@@ i and the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching lead to it that he could throw him out his license on the table .
&quot; Moo@@ dy , best known by its preparation of the un@@ trained Master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , marked the circuit @-@ day treatment &quot; &quot; ridic@@ ulous &quot; &quot; after a pack of mud or sound on the horse , was pushed against the rules . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot;
&quot; I must assume full responsibility for it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my employees has been mist@@ ak@@ able mud , on the leg . &quot;
it could have been yesterday evening so .
it could have been so yesterday the whole day so that was so .
but it also had such a racing day .
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack at the race day . an examination of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
&quot; people who rise these rules , know nothing about the horse . &quot;
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far &quot; , &quot; said m@@ oo@@ dy . &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ am@@ y proposes against ri@@ vals because of claims to ring @-@ ring
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ am@@ y has claimed criticism of the Tac@@ tics from two Premier League &apos;s Favorites of the NR@@ L .
Sydney Roo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ee of the Storm players will be allowed with his team during the high Storm L@@ egs in the Sydney Final in Sydney on Friday evening .
&quot; Bris@@ bane Bron@@ cos Trainer Wayne B@@ enn@@ ett made a little disgu@@ ised note to the Storm Team , after his team had made the final victory against North Queens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Satur@@ day@@ . he called the game a &quot; &quot; pattern &quot; &quot; of Rug@@ by League and said that the two from Queens@@ land would not be &quot; too good &quot; in singing . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ am@@ y defended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team , and said that they are concentrated only on their &quot; contact &quot; in the Tac@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ am@@ y added that the criticism of two leading co@@ aches at his team will make him confident , since it was sorry that they had trou@@ bled away from the Storm Team . &quot;
&quot; this appears repeatedly - I did not hear that Tr@@ ent Robinson over ring @-@ fights , as she said to us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ am@@ y on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that we have changed in our faul@@ ted system or techniques over the last six weeks . however , in the last six weeks we have made our contact in Tac@@ kl@@ es to a real focus , and this gave us the trend revers@@ al . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ento is now there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he is therefore likely not to get used to lose , so it was a bit of shock for him . &quot;
&quot; it is already com@@ ical , as this is again emerging on this season . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ am@@ y has attacked B@@ enn@@ ett idea from &quot; exciting football &quot; and his ment@@ or reminds us that B@@ enn@@ ett St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra will win the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; football . &quot;
Wayne talks about exciting football .
&quot; he compared his game on Saturday evening with our last Friday evening and how ex@@ iting her game was , &quot; &quot; Bell@@ am@@ y said . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was a bo@@ red team cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed , and Wayne he said that he will take care of it . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team who can play and watch this as exciting , especially his young players at their speed . &quot;
&quot; this is the ball play , which you want to play when you have this kind of players . &quot;
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so that they can play like this . &quot;
&quot; I build stronger confidence , because they say these things because they are a bit worried against us to play . &quot;
six weeks ago they were not thought of us when it was the Big Games .
Bell@@ am@@ y also pointed out that the game Storm against ro@@ sters represents a higher result than the Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I have not seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two further tests in our game , but is that a thr@@ illing game ? &quot;
or are Pau@@ sen make and do not points anything more exciting ?
for me it is the sched@@ ules .
&quot; when they mention , it means that we will meet again in a phase . &quot;
&quot; the Storm Team will be free at this weekend as they have won the right to either North Queens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks at the next morning night at the A@@ AMI Park . ticket sales starts from next service morning . &quot;
Ser@@ bi@@ er with 200@@ .000 $ deposit according to drug requirements
&quot; a man who is possibly having a li@@ fel@@ ong sentence threatened because of his temp@@ tation to come into possession of 40 kil@@ ograms of Kok@@ ain , which were b@@ ted by Queens@@ land , has been released against a deposit of 200,000 $ . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five males who were arrested in the last month after the police force 100 kg found on the Yacht Sol@@ ay that came from South America to V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and met in August in Co@@ om@@ era . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed , as he met his co @-@ def@@ ends at the marina and later at Café Co@@ om@@ era Ro@@ adh@@ ouse , where the police took 40 kil@@ ograms of the drug in a Toyota echo . &quot;
&quot; despite a potentially deadly punishment for the attempt to possess a commercial amount of coconut , arg@@ um@@ ented the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , that there may be no evidence that he tried to possess the whole amount and that in the café might have been an in@@ no@@ cu@@ ous cause . &quot;
&quot; the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Fl@@ ur@@ an , was worried about the escape of death at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; explained the court on Wednesday . &quot;
in the case of a criminal object he b@@ ent the police about his place of residence .
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic@@ s mother and bo@@ ots had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollar as security together , to achieve its release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the legislative declar@@ ations of the two people it is clear that the edition of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; said Mr Fl@@ ags . &quot;
&quot; but that alone will not suff@@ ice to keep him out of it , not to appear , he war@@ ned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against deposit , under the conditions that he leaves his Australian and his Ser@@ b Pass , sign up in the police daily and stick to a cur@@ few of 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;

a pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es used the phone of a 11 year old girl to request images of child abuse .
&quot; St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the phone of the girl , when this slept , lo@@ wer@@ ed into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a series of un@@ decent pictures of children who were sent to him by another user . &quot;

&quot; H@@ og@@ g h@@ elled subsequently to the officials that he would do it , since it would lead to &quot; p@@ ests in the internet &quot; &quot; and he then gave to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are her . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ ut@@ or E@@ ili@@ ie Rober@@ ts@@ on said the Dun@@ dee Sher@@ i@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a addi@@ ction , - that he may be addi@@ c@@ tive to sc@@ are people . &quot;
&quot; he gave to that the seek@@ ers were carried out on the computer from him , but said it was done , because he wanted to claim a polic@@ eman to sc@@ ep@@ herds around P@@ est . &quot;
he asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked to send more photos .
he said that He did it to pra@@ ising them .
&quot; he said , he is sick in the head , when he d@@ rank , and said , he wants to see pictures of r@@ ape and murder . &quot;
&quot; MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was on tre@@ m@@ bling and on we@@ eping . &quot;
it then saw the im@@ decent pictures on the phone and con@@ front the acc@@ used .
&quot; the girl was inter@@ viewed and said , that the acc@@ used computer and Play@@ station used to speak with girls who saw much younger than he . &quot;

&quot; defence couns@@ ell@@ Gregor S@@ im asked for that H@@ og@@ g do not appear in the Register of sexu@@ alised criminal law , since they could ar@@ gue that &quot; there is no considerable sexual element &quot; in its failure . &quot;

&quot; H@@ og@@ g was granted in this case refundable but was held for hear@@ ings on other still standing cases in cu@@ sto@@ dy . &quot;

&quot; in 2015 , it is mainly to trace movement during the shelf life , which at present itself are very good for sale . &quot;
cars from the compact class are particularly in demand : approximately 28,@@ 1 per cent of new registr@@ ations fell according to strength ( KBA ) only in August on this segment .
this is also reflected in the I@@ AA ( Audi@@ um@@ urs@@ days 17th to 27 September ) .
&quot; between all the fut@@ uris@@ tic conception , and new upper @-@ class and luxury cars will be presented in this year especially a lot of new compact models . &quot;
&quot; one of the biggest movers for the German auto industry is the Opel Astra , who will stand in the autumn at the dealers . &quot;
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; so that the volume model can also be sold well , the new Astra model will not be much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel offers an entry below the largest ri@@ vals VW Golf in the prospect , which starts at 17 650 euros . &quot;
the current Astra costs 16 990 € .
Astra model is available with a new 1,@@ 4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp . &quot;

&quot; as a second variant will follow in the spring of the Com@@ bi , which is already visible at the I@@ AA . &quot;
and what happens next to Astra on the I@@ AA remaining to a new compact car ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault is the fourth generation of its Astra ri@@ val of the race .
at the trade fair the Mé@@ gan@@ e is only as five @-@ fifth in a conventional and an emph@@ atically sporting GT @-@ Version .
&quot; in the trade it comes to the early next year , then also as a comb@@ i . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : completely new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan Alliance plans to find its position in the strongly increasing segment with the new model .
&quot; the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines fits fully into the design line of the brand . &quot;
the base model will get a gas@@ oline engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer is also a diesel oil with 80 kW / 109 PS or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Suzuki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also called the Suzuki Bal@@ eno that celeb@@ rates its world premiere .

J@@ VA Berlin @-@ T@@ egel : five sqm of cells are deser@@ ted
&quot; the Bundes@@ verfassungs@@ gericht has given an Ex @-@ H@@ äf@@ t@@ ling of the don@@ or institution , which was lod@@ ged in a small cell that is monthly . &quot;
&quot; due to the violation of their human dignity , prisoners of principle claim to financial compensation when they are contained in small cells . &quot;
this was the Federal Constitu@@ tional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
those affected can therefore put the judges even then to money if they were im@@ pris@@ oned only a few days in the narrow spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 112@@ 7 / 14 ) .
&quot; a ex @-@ H@@ äf@@ en@@ ling was successful in Karlsruhe with its constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe : he was housed in the don@@ or institution of Berlin @-@ T@@ egel of approximately five square metres of floor space ; the toilet was spatial not separate . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man , who has now returned to the details of his retirement , now on an unbe@@ atable bay , in a larger cell . &quot;
his Am@@ t@@ sh@@ af@@ tungs@@ sequ@@ ing due to the un@@ worthy det@@ ention against the Land Berlin .
&quot; however , the Constitu@@ tional Treaty took up the verdi@@ ct of the Court of Justice in Berlin and will then return the case to the renewed examination . &quot;
they see the human dignity of man hurt .
Kam@@ mer@@ ral decides to exceed the height of compensation
&quot; although for legal reasons of the frag@@ mentary period only a few days of rest for compensation are decisive , be the claim decision was given , it was mentioned . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , a cur@@ v@@ ature of the legal protection of the personality would be to be fear@@ ed . &quot;
the Kam@@ mer@@ ral Tribunal must now clarify the amount of money injury .
the constitutional adjustment have already strengthened the rights of prisoners of prisoners in the past .
&quot; thus they spoke only in April to a pris@@ oner of damages , because he was shot naked in a cell . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; human un@@ worthy is a decision of 2011 as well as the multi @-@ layout of a cell without separate toilet . &quot;
&quot; he also confirmed the Berlin Constitu@@ tional Court , in addition to the Berlin Constitu@@ tional Court , who had made an un@@ decent accommodation in November 2009 . &quot;
the dam@@ per Kl@@ äger soldiers had three months a day between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
the j@@ ail @-@ pris@@ ons had come into the head@@ lines in the past few weeks as well .
&quot; prisoners are therefore always included 23 hours including the aggression of aggression , even to bat @-@ parties shall have already been due to the ten@@ se situation . &quot;
&quot; after information the Jus@@ tin hu@@ ts are not occupied at 21 places in T@@ egel because of junior leaders , 19 shall be dropped . &quot;
Angela Merkel and the refuge@@ e policy : &quot; we are creating the &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept them .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany after the forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Finance in this year , according to the testimony of Vice @-@ anz@@ ler Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even in a position to accommodate a million refugees . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated a challenge in light of the un@@ common challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can create this and we create it . &quot;
what comes to Germany gives the following overview .
&quot; according to different proj@@ ections between 35@@ 0000 ( estimate of the federal Ministry ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) dw@@ ell@@ ings annually - and indeed the next five years . &quot;
that is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
&quot; dramatic is the lack of living space , but above all at paid plac@@ ements : annually 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social housing from the rental price , and around these particularly favorable apartments will also apply to refugees . &quot;
&quot; Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SD@@ P ) aims to double the support , from currently 518 million to one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; much too little is that from the perspective of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social Assembly would have to grow every year , to invest an funding in the amount of € 6.4 billion per year . &quot;
&quot; in fact , scientists and Federal Minister agree that there must be more tax benefits for investment in housing . &quot;
&quot; according to the Institute for labor market and occupational research , it is estimated that 55 percent of the p@@ oul@@ ders in Germany can be employed in Germany over the long term . &quot;
&quot; however , refugees in Germany would not at all be asked for their qualifications to assist them in entering an entry , critic@@ ised Claudia Walter , Project management for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann foundation . &quot;
but the integration of refugees is vital whether they find work in Germany .
&quot; work is the key to social contacts , for the esteem in the fee ; but also for the self @-@ esteem of the immigrants , says Mig@@ r@@ ulation for@@ scher Diet@@ rich Thr@@ ush@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; according to the hei@@ mer@@ its , there was a political transition in Germany : from working ban on refugees for the recognition of work . &quot;
&quot; while there was an un@@ employed for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years ago , this was reduced in November 2014 to three months , as well as the resi@@ dences to get asylum seek@@ ers at a destination . &quot;
&quot; in society - also because of the lack of lack of labour - mostly taken , the point of view taken that refugees need to be able to access the labor market faster . &quot;
a major hur@@ d@@ le for access to the labour market is lack of interpretation .
&quot; to date , there is not yet a sufficient offer of general and self @-@ related language courses . &quot;
studies also show that jobs will most often be taught by personal contacts .
&quot; therefore , the construction of networks is therefore according to the &quot; Thr@@ ush@@ hardt of the King@@ s@@ weg &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Berlin school administration has found that only a few bre@@ ached parents give their children to the Kit@@ ā@@ s , estimated at least ten to 15 per cent , &quot; &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ schem@@ bar , coordin@@ ator for youth and family in the Berlin Sen@@ ats@@ verwaltung . &quot;
&quot; to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the management of hand@@ cu@@ ffs is distributed in different languages . &quot;
&quot; if the need for educ@@ ators should rise greatly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase learning capacity - as far as he allows more specialized schools . &quot;
in the countries students are prepared without interpre@@ t@@ knowledge in welcome classes .
&quot; but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers and teachers , but as in Berlin , also by instruc@@ tors , who only have a qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; in them there is no shor@@ tage , says Be@@ ate St@@ ations of the Berlin School administration . &quot;
the German Student@@ en@@ werk estimates that approximately 20 per cent of refugees in Germany want to study .
&quot; in principle , no state asylum seek@@ ers or pl@@ edges the study - the only exception was so far Berlin , In@@ sen@@ ator Frank H@@ enkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned its position . &quot;
studies of study might be facilit@@ ated access to the university .
&quot; refugees with a re@@ imb@@ urs@@ ement or atten@@ uation , do not receive services after the asylum seek@@ er Act more , once they begin a study . &quot;
&quot; the latter , basically , do not get a BA@@ Fö@@ G , as they do not fall under the circle of the un@@ authorised persons . &quot;
&quot; toler@@ ated refugees had to have lived in Germany for so far , to be entitled to BA@@ Fö@@ G authentic@@ ate from January 1st 2016 , this sp@@ icy is waiting for 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but this funding gap must be closed but Steff@@ en Kra@@ ch , Berlin@@ s State Secretary for Science , and the Deutsche Student@@ en@@ werk . &quot;
students should immediately get BA@@ Fö@@ G .
&quot; in future Islam will play a more important role in future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should respect Islam succ@@ essi@@ vely the same rights as they have the churches , and continue to develop the existing State Ch@@ urches to a new state @-@ religions . &quot;
&quot; important would also be the foundation of an Islamic welfare association , which takes care of the new@@ com@@ ers . &quot;
the rights also belong to the rights .
&quot; in this way , the representatives of Islam must be a clear point of contact with some and willing to co @-@ operate with the state in many fields and to make certain control options . &quot;
this also includes the willingness to act against religious fundament@@ alism .
&quot; the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ zy@@ ek , expressed concern on Thursday the concern , religious conflicts may also be accepted in Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to imp@@ ose such conflicts in Germany , have now their right to stay in Germany , in Germany , he said , &quot; he said in Bay@@ rische ischer Rund@@ funk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law into Arabic .
integration will continue to be a major theme of the whole society in future .
&quot; in this way , the majority of society will have to change , the break@@ down of discrimination and racism will vary . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , Germany - as a result of European decisions - since a scar@@ ce decade anti @-@ discrimination building and a general equality law . &quot;
&quot; but it goes very slowly , as the NS@@ U @-@ Mor@@ ning series showed that the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive . &quot;
&quot; equal chances for all of the migrants &quot; organizations and interested parties have been calling for a long time to call for an international agreement like the anti @-@ rac@@ ist conflict in Germany , must remain in reality over the next few years , to keep the country peac@@ efully and benefit its new citizens - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany was able to supply of the previously expected refugees , &quot; Medical president Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; what Man@@ - Power and capacities affects , we create the &quot; , &quot; he said the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , extra money can be used in the system . &quot;
&quot; to avoid Eng@@ bass , demands Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery , to equi@@ p all com@@ ers in the registration of health cards . &quot;
achieved services may be p@@ ayed later with the federal states .
&quot; and in the long @-@ term , it is highly ques@@ tion@@ able , so many people with the limited performance of view , see the asylum seek@@ er Act . &quot;
otherwise make the doctors mainly to create the language barriers .
&quot; so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has been proven that the migrants are clear@@ ed over their diseases than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , also in doctors would need to be taken over , they are requested . &quot;
&quot; also helped many refugees , but also with more general medical staff in the emergency @-@ patient . &quot;
and with another diagnostic eye .
&quot; among the refuge@@ e camps , there are much more of the disabled people , and at the young people it is about HIV education . &quot;
&quot; with the partly other cases of disease , German doctors are from their education , but clearly , says Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ ect@@ osis or tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis are not as difficult to recognize , and what the sle@@ eves may be concerned , be possibly even all@@ evi@@ ate by the refugees in sight . &quot;
the Syri@@ ans had a highly developed educational system for refugees and even doctors .
&quot; to practice practicing , however , they would need to prove their qualifications and may return to test again . &quot;
&quot; at least half of the refugees in Germany to come against estimates of the B@@ und@@ ine psych@@ otherap@@ ist@@ enk@@ ammer ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) psych@@ ologically sick , most suffer from a post@@ injury @-@ disorder or under depression . &quot;
&quot; hur@@ t@@ ty were refuge@@ e cattle , explains Diet@@ rich Mun@@ z , President of B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recent published study of the TU München illustr@@ ates that every 5th @-@ Syrian refuge@@ e lift are trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
&quot; who is afflic@@ ted by a post@@ injury @-@ type disorder , suff@@ ers from among other things with so @-@ called Flash@@ backs with breathing difficulty , ver@@ tig@@ o , car@@ r@@ ens and death . &quot;
&quot; further symptoms are sleeping , and concentr@@ ating on concentration , strong sho@@ ck@@ ness and emotional de@@ ath@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; to prevent that the symptoms were chronic , be an early treatment necessary , declared Mun@@ z . &quot;
&quot; to date , however , only four per cent of the mental cran@@ ial refugees receive a psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; though , psych@@ ic cran@@ ial asylum seek@@ ers in the social offices provide an application for psych@@ otherapy , but it takes time mostly several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the social offices in most cases Sach@@ sen@@ ers or doctors , who are not educated for the psychological disease , whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this leads often to mis@@ cre@@ denti@@ als , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
Man@@ ege invites to dream
with the new st@@ aging &quot; passion &quot; the Circus focuses on the traditions of Circus art .
&quot; the goal is to draw any age group in the spell of amazing ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ ses and unique entertainment . &quot;
now the Circus is in the ring on the bricks of the was@@ en to dream .
&quot; our passion is the circ@@ us . &quot;
&quot; I can not imagine , without living my circ@@ us family , &quot; says Steph@@ anie , Zodi@@ tu@@ son and Jun@@ iors . &quot;
&quot; passion , &quot; - under this motto the current local @-@ goat is at the same time . &quot;
already for more than 33 years the circ@@ us is in the hands of the family .
the gift to delight is the family in the blood .
&quot; it is important to take the people away from their everyday life and take them for two hours in a completely different world , &quot; stres@@ ses 27 @-@ year Jun@@ iors . &quot;
&quot; Man@@ b cock@@ tail with world city flair , &quot; says Director Reinhard trainer its concept . &quot;
50 cities at the less than 3 000 kilometers long tour can experience this flair .
the program of Circus convinced with talented artists from around the world .
&quot; distinguished at the international circ@@ us festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family runs the audience with w@@ it and charm into their spell . &quot;
also the Castillo Brothers understand their craft .
with the hero of the st@@ rolling movies I want to drive the Cub@@ an duo .
ligh@@ tness and mot@@ ility - identify with these words .
your hum@@ orous art at the mast should be con@@ quer the storm in the storm .
except through numerous salmon fascinated the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus also with finger@@ tips and laughter .
balance the wheel to a sphere ?
for He Yuan no problem .
slim people captiv@@ ating and sc@@ aring at the same time .
Wang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics like little others and fascinated using their flexibility .
60 people from twelve nations provide diversity in every sense .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; stressed Steph@@ an@@ ies mother , Brig@@ itte . &quot;
mistakes in the position of circ@@ us are only too often subject to various animal welfare organizations .
Steph@@ anie drink also about position : &quot; &quot; it is not good for our animals , it does not go well . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit .
four @-@ leg@@ ged Arti@@ sts &apos; as they are lovingly referred to as the possibility of having read the eyes from the eyes .
we want to work together with the animals and have fun with them .
feel the animal does not feel at ease it does not want to go in the arena .
the upper@@ most order is : good for the animals .
&quot; specially on their z@@ eb@@ roid Jum@@ bo , a mix of a sh@@ ov@@ un pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a z@@ eb@@ ra@@ stu@@ d , the family is proud . &quot;
the two animals have lived in one housing for eight years and nothing has happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was &quot; , &quot; said Brig@@ itte . &quot;
&quot; the z@@ eb@@ roid is not yet ready for the riding , but for this it is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus . &quot;
so for every visitor something is likely to be part of it .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; &quot; says Steph@@ anie , &quot; &quot; no matter whether five or 1 200 spect@@ ators , we always give our best and are with all the heart . &quot;
the Circus runs from 17 to 20 September daily at 17 a.m. and 8 p.m .
on Sunday the programme starts at 11 and 16 o &apos;clock .
Thursday is family day for the performance at 5 pm the prices are reduced .
&quot; moreover , every day the animal show is open from 10 am to 6 pm . &quot;
Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert M@@ ug@@ abe holds the wrong speech in parliament
&quot; Mr M@@ ug@@ abe , Africa äl@@ test@@ er leader , fell down at the beginning of the year by a po@@ dium down the stairs . &quot;
&quot; he continued , but the video of the case quickly became about social media . &quot;
the opening of the parliament was also deteri@@ or@@ ated by claims by members of the opposition that they had gotten anonymous death threats and they have war@@ ned that they were war@@ ned by Mr M@@ ug@@ abe with Bu@@ hr@@ mann .
&quot; in the past month she had expanded him and had his speech to the position of the nation in the parliament - this is the speech which he was repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the speaker of the movement for democratic change ( movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven op@@ positions have received SMS messages on their hand , which they war@@ ned against it , Mr. M@@ ug@@ ab@@ es . &quot;

Hewlett @-@ Packard will de@@ build up to 30.000 jobs
Hewlett @-@ Packard will expected to dismant@@ le 25.@@ 000 to 30.000 jobs as part of the corporate restructuring and saving efforts at the company &apos;s services .
HP will re @-@ split companies later this year into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing company hardware and its service activities .
&quot; the expected job building leads to a burden of more than 2,@@ 7 billion dollars of the fourth quarter , said HP at an explanation . &quot;
&quot; this restructuring measures will allow a competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ president and Chief Executive that shall lead the unity after separation . &quot;
&quot; Hewlett @-@ Packard Company will be smaller and stronger than it is HP today and we have a broad and deep@@ est portfolio of shops that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot;
as independent company we are better placed than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
&quot; Hewlett @-@ Packard Company has more than 50 billion $ annual turnover and will be focused on delivering previously un@@ att@@ ained , integrated technology solutions for businesses , &quot; thus an explanation of the company . &quot;
&quot; it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 1930@@ s by gradu@@ ates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hewlett @-@ Packard , to produce elec@@ tro @-@ plants and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage was called &quot; &quot; the birth@@ place of the Si@@ licon Valley . &quot; &quot;
HP has a massive restructuring through to manage the conversion of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; the measure from HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech company , is the latest in this area based on the conviction that &apos;s working closely focused companies perform better performance . &quot;
FC Arsenal @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that te@@ amm@@ ates in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb have to stand behind the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; she stressed out to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it wasn &apos;t September , and as long as his rehabilitation happens to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four games for England and due to its history , its participation in the next summer is certainly still un@@ certain . &quot;
the great shame associated with this actual problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate slope of infringement and then returned to his old weak@@ ening during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury is not threat@@ ening the career , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it is a bone not whol@@ esome .
it is not a major task .
this was just an accident .
&quot; it was not in contact with his nu@@ ckl@@ es , or with the injuries he had previously . &quot;
&quot; this may be true from purely medical perspective but as usual also recognized , there are the related danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an un@@ pleas@@ ing pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd will record 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of arsen@@ als of 157 le@@ ague in the last five seasons .
&quot; the wider picture for arsen@@ al is that they have been created in six of eight game times since 2007 / 08 , one of the two Premier League clubs which have been issued most vulner@@ abilities . &quot;
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a devil @-@ circle , but arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the injury rates will last during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes if you come back from an injury , you have a sus@@ cep@@ tible period of time when you strengthen your body and win combat force &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome it .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it , and he will run a career of the way he deserves . &quot;
arsen@@ al begins its Champions League G@@ ad on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ track to next Wednesday and Wen@@ ger puts himself a rotation within the team .
&quot; Hé@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey travelled not to Croatia , which means Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ uch@@ y and Art@@ eta . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also begin with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Th@@ eo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and keep the players that require a small car@@ nival , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; although arsen@@ al clear favourites are to come through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir @-@ stadium in Zagreb is among the play@@ grounds with the greatest intim@@ i@@ dation effect in Europe . &quot;
&quot; Dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games , after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign launched in the last season . &quot;
&quot; the stadium was sh@@ aken on Tuesday night by a earthquake , wher@@ ein the Rich@@ ard@@ sk@@ ala 3,@@ 2 were measured . &quot;
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; Wen@@ ger is the opinion that arsen@@ al has drawn the doctrine of the past season with the Champions League &apos;s capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains from distant hope to guide the association &apos;s first Europ@@ ap@@ ok@@ al tri@@ umph . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it has never worked at arsen@@ al .
&quot; we were in 2006 very close , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not a dre@@ amer . &quot;
Friend@@ ship Fe@@ ast : the Com@@ edy @-@ Show that gives us serious lessons about male friend@@ ships !
&quot; the absence of similar depic@@ tions in shows is evident , particularly with regard to how the need for males to open themselves now even more des@@ perate as ever since self @-@ murder in young men at a 15 @-@ year @-@ H@@ och . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important death of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in trying to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ ick ( calm - campaign against a edit@@ ary life ) 2015 as the year of the man to question the culture in question , the men are hin@@ dered to seek help if they need it . &quot;
friendship is the heart in the battle to master this challenge .
&quot; a recent study at more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms displayed that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; &quot; healthy mood &quot; , &quot; his chances of enjoyment . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not depres@@ sed , hal@@ ved a circle of spirit@@ ually healthy friends the risks of mental problems . &quot;
&quot; but of course you have to have friends only once , so that a friendship can work . &quot;
&quot; in the age of more than social media , with its focus on style about substance , the in@@ medi@@ ability of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital lives have the need to thri@@ ve strong , life @-@ funny and successful to appear , even though in fact the isolation is dominated . &quot;
&quot; this super@@ ficial success is dominated by that domin@@ ates what psych@@ ologists extr@@ ins@@ ic values call ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our spiritual health much more deeply . &quot;
&quot; and like a video @-@ game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy it . &quot;
&quot; the beauty of Friends was , that these focus was placed on the head . &quot;
&quot; each character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , defined by interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; hum@@ ours of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent h@@ ugs , mom@@ entary in the soccer fields , and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can relate to it , even if they are often back to explore completely their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as an employee of the phone care he explained to me : ... &quot; &quot; my audience @-@ role for people who feel depres@@ sed and sel@@ fish , has really pointed to me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
&quot; the males who contact us feel often not able to speak with friends . &quot;
&quot; the old &quot; &quot; Rede@@ mption &quot; &quot; I come to right with a enormous effect on how the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when dealing with problems openly . &quot;
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term admir@@ ation mechanisms .
it presents clearly the small moments of the male friend@@ ships .
&quot; thus very my objective out@@ si@@ der status on the phone to watch people in moments of desp@@ air also may help , the long term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
and so if you visit this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ ship with the celebration of the day completely re@@ designed setting setting , why don &apos;t take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or , even better if you can sit around in Star@@ bu@@ cks someone alone , give him a smile and say hello to him . &quot;
one never knows what is the difference your friendship could do .
friends is sent at Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the entire 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ ship
&quot; di Maria affects to help PS@@ G , Hun@@ edo@@ ara &quot;
angel Di Maria celeb@@ rates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ ui@@ di and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani to go to Hun@@ edo@@ ara hits .
&quot; di Maria meet at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and will assist PS@@ G , in Malmö . &quot;
here are the Game Report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held Course as Paris Saint @-@ Germain its Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the Prin@@ c@@ il@@ stadium of the Tuesday .
&quot; Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League de@@ vised as PS@@ G player who brought the French Master on the way , but afterwards she missed a number of opportunities before they finally increased her lead as Cav@@ ani in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and chess t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in group A requires a strong start against the Swedish Masters , because they don &apos;t only strive for the qualification for the K@@ .O@@ .-@@ l@@ aps , but an improvement on the path to the quarter @-@ finals in each of the past three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , there was not a class@@ ement of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ him@@ o@@ vic@@ s odds in play against his home town team and against the club , with which he began his illustr@@ ative career already in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it is not easy to win home or upward at the Champions League . therefore , it is a good start to gain 2 : 0 to provo@@ ke our oppos@@ ing problems and relaxed , even if there are certain things we have to finish in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; this is a good sign .
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we don &apos;t have sco@@ red one or two more goals . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic returned to his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which had decided on weekends a 2 : 2 oun@@ ce on their own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but was engra@@ ved in the fourth minute by Di Maria . &quot;
&quot; the Argentin@@ ean wing stor@@ ms was referred to as the man to bring the PS@@ G to the next level in Europe , and he pointed out why , when he went in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis pass behind the Malmö defense , before it enters into Johan Wil@@ and is beautifully situated in the long corner of the net . &quot;
&quot; but if anyone believed that PS@@ G would win a great win , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malmö , the Celtic in a Play @-@ off proposed to reach this level , stepped on An@@ hu@@ ff with nine national play@@ ers on the field and stayed with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the mid@@ field is a serious opponent . &quot;
&quot; but besides a shot of Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who pass close to Kevin P@@ apps P@@ fo@@ sten at the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; at times , PS@@ G himself gave himself up , with some mis@@ de@@ hydr@@ ated and poor results , not least by I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic , who was at no less than five trials alone in the first half of pun@@ ched and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani installed it after the rest@@ art . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless he pointed a lot more skill when he brought his fellow @-@ players into the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic to convert the Di Maria into a turn , which was cut by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the P@@ fo@@ sten ... &quot;
&quot; the second gate fell shortly after the hours @-@ mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the S@@ ay@@ er reached its sixth season , after I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic had taken out a left fl@@ ank of Max@@ well . &quot;
&quot; this ended all thoughts that Malmö could come back to the game , and only an excellent inter@@ ri@@ pping of Wil@@ low from the shortest distance to David Lu@@ iz could keep the end result low before spare player E@@ z@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi was released in the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Malmö , age Har@@ eide has later played that PS@@ G played a class about his team and the Norwegian said , &quot; &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have only played in the Swedish le@@ ague , which did not have the same level . &quot;
the qualification games are not enough . &quot;
hat from Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world - and Europ@@ am@@ eister X@@ avi plays for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar for summer 2015
&quot; the FC Bayern stood obviously shortly before the commitment of Spain super@@ star X@@ avi , who played back for FC Barcelona . &quot;
&quot; eight times of Spanish Master , three times kno@@ ck@@ out champion , four times champion @-@ League tournament , two times Europa Champion , the first time in the World Champion - the title list of X@@ avi is stunning . &quot;
in summer you left 35 @-@ year @-@ old after 24 years to FC Barcelona and moved to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
&quot; but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca bet@@ ra@@ das X@@ avi now , that he was already standing before the departure of Barcelona before the departure of Barcelona . &quot;
&quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça would like to sell me . &quot;
&quot; Madrid then at that time everything , we did nothing . &quot;
and this also becomes the FC Bayern .
&quot; X@@ avi : &quot; &quot; there was a offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ness wanted me to have . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; reminder : in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ es@@ sman , took over FC Bayern . &quot;
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi was not inter@@ changeable
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this is today working for the German record masters : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola .
&quot; X@@ avi declared , why : &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has Gu@@ ardi@@ ola between contract and I played a great EM . &quot;
PE@@ P has told me that I would not remember that he could not imagine the team without me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so he has triumph@@ ed . &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ erns &apos;s Play@@ time 2008 / 2009 with X@@ avi would be .
&quot; X@@ avi stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ finals of the Champions League against Bavaria about the entire distance on the lawn , the Red Guard ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the end of the King &apos;s tri@@ umph . &quot;
matt Dam@@ on plays diversity in movies
matt Dam@@ on con@@ front the af@@ ro@@ American fil@@ mm@@ aker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the variety and said they will not be needed behind the scenes .
&quot; as a result of the Sunday night of H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light broke the experienced actor Brown , when this was the need for alternative perspectives stressed in relation to a black prot@@ agon@@ ists in the selected screen@@ play of the project . &quot;
&quot; when we talk about diversity , then do it in the cast of the film and not in the cast of the show , &quot; assured Dam@@ on . &quot;
Brown re@@ formed sho@@ cked with bel@@ lied un@@ belief and called &quot; ho@@ o ! Wow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the actor by The Mar@@ tian . &quot;
&quot; Dam@@ on and Brown joined the Produ@@ z@@ ent@@ enk@@ ol@@ lie Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss about the show @-@ fin@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; I want to call people to think about it - whoever will be the fil@@ mm@@ aker - how they treat the figure of Harmony , &quot; Brown first . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a sp@@ line , that is be@@ aten by her white state . &quot;
&quot; the producer of De@@ ar White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for the Director &apos;s rights to the film ; Dam@@ on did , that their director could give us something we could not want . &quot;
after the discussion was aired to explo@@ ded the Social Media against mis@@ approval via Dam@@ on comments .
&quot; Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni : oppressed his w@@ ut over the clip by talking &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their variety - this is SO LE@@ T that it hurt . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ we@@ et served more than 5,000 res@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its publication . &quot;
&quot; Dam@@ on Comments come at a time , at the exact time representation in the media at the top of the social discussion . &quot;
&quot; after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white pol@@ ishing , the movement of Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter took a far effect and dr@@ agon@@ izing law@@ yers and authorities , discrimin@@ atory practices against blu@@ red refl@@ ections . &quot;
in February the singer prince gave a kick on the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; album silent , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot;
&quot; how books and black lives , have also still their meaning . &quot;
&quot; in a younger time , leader of the movement of Black Li@@ ves was a statement published and in response to the question of the Fox News @-@ personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group was regarded as a hat@@ red group . &quot;
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love @-@ group , &quot; said the leaders . &quot;
&quot; recently announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media business , who are invited to visit the pop@@ e to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the west . &quot;
&quot; whether he accepted the invitation or met the Pope , is un@@ clear . &quot;
&apos; American Nin@@ ja Warrior &apos; Gre@@ enland first Champion
&quot; professional clim@@ bers , older and user assistance Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first ath@@ l@@ ete who won the American Nin@@ ja Warrior on Monday night and took the Grand Prix of $ 1 million with home . &quot;
&quot; the competition show , which had just completed its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant , which could complete all stages of its barrier @-@ course . &quot;
&quot; during the summer , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ ann Ge@@ off B@@ ritten , to the final . &quot;
the last task was climbing to a 75 feet long clim@@ bed in 30 seconds .
&quot; this came the task within the time with which he was the first ath@@ l@@ ete , which ended the stren@@ uous phase 4 by American Nin@@ ja Warrior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero ended this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with e ! messages after the hard fight , still under shock about winning the Great Prize of 1 Million $ . &quot;
&quot; I mean it is amazing to think about it , I have never earned more than 10,000 $ or a life , &quot; Isaac E ! &quot;
quite suddenly .. how I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the leit@@ ner Producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood re@@ por@@ ter to discuss the finals , and why B@@ ritten , although it ended up first at all in the course , not any prize money is received . &quot;
according to the rules the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; if there is more than a fin@@ alist , it will be the one with the fastest time , &quot; says We@@ ed . &quot;
how much the money is a wonderful price and life changed ; it gets the great gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he has triumph@@ ed about anything .
he is just so fortunate to have done what he did .
bulk of awards received by fans .
he is such a great guy and a family grandfather .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; wick@@ off said to me , &quot; If I should be be@@ aten by someone , then I am glad that it is Isaac . &quot;
&quot; and I think they felt just as felt , if they had changed the roles . &quot;
&quot; America Nin@@ ja Warrior has been extended for a eighth season , the shooting will start in spring 2016 . &quot;
Detroit Tig@@ ers s@@ ne@@ ak to Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ PO@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
previously they were one of the best teams in the bas@@ eball than today the Tig@@ ers stand at the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers have been reduced to their role as a spo@@ ilers and played these part in the Tuesday perfect against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field .
the T@@ wins resulted in a chance to climb inside a half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League game .
&quot; Detroit , even if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word that was so difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all vic@@ tories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Di@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; Tiger Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon gave his early offensive support , when Detroit died three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth , and then once again in the ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck 6 times in 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and allowed three touches .
it was only his first successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I will end this year greatly , &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw in the bull@@ wh@@ ites each game , and therefore I want to go into the game fully . &quot;
the des@@ ig@@ ni@@ fied tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hit and was in two R@@ uns , his first r@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August . &quot;
&quot; it was the first triple @-@ hit game from Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against the Seattle mar@@ in@@ ers on July 6th . &quot;
&quot; he has br@@ anded the van@@ guard , &quot; said Ex@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at ( brass training ) , looked clearly better out in the bull@@ wh@@ ites , and he brought it straight into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three r@@ uns in the background , at the end of the seventh inn@@ ings , the T@@ wins had its best chance to come back into the game . &quot;
center F@@ iel@@ der Byron Bu@@ x@@ ton ordered the inning with a double on the left field line .
&quot; right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks made a bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zi@@ er to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ de Har@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ dy over@@ ed wall , the only man with whom he was faced , before the des@@ ig@@ ni@@ fied R@@ ookie Miguel S@@ ano , who will join the R@@ ookie tri@@ via a Two @-@ Run . &quot;
with a pair of run@@ ners and the final @-@ run on the second brought se@@ hagen to the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ps to a Double Play .
&quot; it was the leader in the Major League for the 27th time this season , that Pl@@ ou@@ ps made a double Play . &quot;
after Detroit was added to an Insurance @-@ Run 1. at the end of the ne@@ below Inn@@ ed a R@@ BI @-@ Double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and recorded the booth of 5 @-@ 4 .
but the ri@@ bb@@ ons are however S@@ ano with three pitch for his fifth bit .
Detroit benef@@ ited the pre@@ lu@@ de of the game from a still not moving Phil H@@ ugh@@ es .
the tig@@ ers achieved three arm@@ our in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been rep@@ ain@@ ted before the play of the injury list after having been missing over a month because of having had back pain .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for me , &quot; said Mr H@@ ugh@@ es , &quot; but I felt comfor@@ ting when I put up and sen@@ sed that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches as in the third verse . &quot;
&quot; after they received the first Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ bat@@ ter , H@@ alls gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; a two @-@ Out Walk for J@@ .D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into the game , who made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game . &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 track series with the run@@ ners in the sc@@ oring position .
&quot; the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed by a single on the right hand , got another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third what the threat had ended . &quot;
the Tig@@ ers presented in the second to obtain a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ osis to the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; this was a great blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he did not understand very well , but he caught the correct place . &quot;
&quot; H@@ ugh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ Count , no points generated in the third time before it was replaced by the relief of A.@@ J.@@ Ach@@ ter . &quot;
at H@@ ugh@@ es there came to three R@@ uns with six hits and a Walk with four strings .
ann@@ ot@@ ations : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z constituted due to a violation of the worm debt .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who has operated the shoulder of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 .
&quot; San@@ che@@ z , since the middle of August on the injury list , due to a school@@ ing , should be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris from the off@@ erer is underlined to start against the T@@ wins . &quot;
&quot; Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers , since it was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on 30 July . &quot;
he was missing on 20 August due to a tor@@ ment in the right gir@@ d@@ le .
the tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will finish their series of three games in the Target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) is playing against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 ) &quot;

Isch@@ inger : German military action in Syria
&quot; head of the Mün@@ ch@@ ner Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military action with German participation in Syria . &quot;
&quot; I believe that the far@@ ewell thinking about military action options cannot take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
he thre@@ w the European states &quot; collective . &quot;
four years ago you &apos;ve been happy that the Kel@@ ch has gone out for Germany before the Kel@@ ch .
&quot; now the conflict is lying in front of our door@@ step , &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot;
the former German Ambassador in Washington also called for a massive excav@@ ation of international aid to refugees .
Austria controls on southern and Eastern borders
&quot; in Germany , Austria has also introduced back@@ controls to its southern and eastern borders . &quot;
&quot; the Austrian Interior of Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said on the Friday evening in the Austrian TV station OR@@ F , about Hungary also will now be returned now . &quot;
also Germany has no refugees returned to Austria .
&quot; no , that is so agreed , &quot; explained . &quot;
&quot; to ask for an agreement , after which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , said Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , it has already been a relevant discussion between the Director @-@ General for Public Safety and representatives of Germany . &quot;
concrete numbers they did not leave and dism@@ is@@ sed talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
&quot; over the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees came across the so @-@ so @-@ route from Hungary to Austria . &quot;
your goal is mostly Germany .
&quot; ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann applied together with several other EU heads of state and government a special summit for next week . &quot;
Germany started on Sunday with temporary border controls .
the EU @-@ states have not yet been able to agree on a common action in the crisis .
the EU &apos;s interior ministers want to take on the coming Tuesday ( 22 September ) at a special meeting on the binding distribution of more than 120 000 refugees .
&quot; given the strong refuge@@ e sand@@ ran@@ gs in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the up@@ take and distribution of people more strongly . &quot;
&quot; the Covenant will manage this together with the countries , the Merkel announced the late afternoon after almost four first consultation with the Prime Minister at the registr@@ ar in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Merkel underlined , those people who have bre@@ wing the protection , be@@ ats this too . &quot;
&quot; however , who do not have a super@@ visor , could not remain in Germany too . &quot;
this view is ir@@ relevant in the round .
&quot; the ch@@ anc@@ ellor stressed the state as a whole , now with a &quot; huge strength &quot; force . &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thousands of des@@ perate refugees have now been killed on the balcony route . &quot;
&quot; in the night , Hungary had closed its 175 kilometres long border with Serbia on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; a few hours later , the government announced the border into Budapest , also the border to Romania with a fence . &quot;
this neighbouring countries belong differently from Serbia to the EU .
&quot; Hungary wants to avoid that tu@@ gs were examined in Romania , said Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ j@@ ar@@ to to the planned new border fence . &quot;
the Romanian government condemned the plan immediately .
there were first im@@ pris@@ als of people who had through the fence .
in Turkey we had to say thousands of migrants on their way to the Greek border .

no diet fruit - Mang@@ os contain a lot of sugar
Mang@@ os are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
&quot; but who wants to pay attention to his slim appearance , the one is often more prec@@ eded by them . &quot;
because Mang@@ os contain relatively much sugar - especially Sac@@ char@@ ose .
&quot; healthy are the exotic fruits anyway : in them are B vitamins , as well as the vitamins E and C . mostly contain m@@ ang@@ oes , but much vitamin A and its pre @-@ stage beta car@@ ot@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; who e@@ ats the fruits , thus supports t@@ end@@ ent , immune system and metabo@@ lic processes in the body . &quot;
&quot; when buying man@@ gan@@ os should not be too soft or too firm , and to cra@@ w@@ l . &quot;
&quot; the color @-@ color alone says nothing about how ri@@ pe the fruit is - so also green m@@ ang@@ oes can taste very tasty . &quot;
they should store at room temperature and be consumed within a few days .
then taste pure pure or sweet food .
but a m@@ ango are also hearty dishes a special touch .
they mil@@ ates the slightly bitter taste of man@@ ure t@@ art as Chic@@ o@@ ree and radi@@ c@@ cio .

Rome has a Martin Lu@@ ther Square
almost 500 years after the Reformation there is a Martin Lu@@ ther Square .
&quot; in the presence of town President Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino , a previous place in the park was baptized in the park on the Opp@@ io Hill to the name of the German Re@@ former . &quot;

hammer Artist invested three years into the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) Dorn@@ en@@ kr@@ one is one of the main stations that ad@@ mar the Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updates their Bible .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which now appeared with colorful pictures . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning , the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated in 150 moti@@ fs his very personal interpre@@ tations of biblical stories on paper and canvas . &quot;
&quot; his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colours and imagin@@ ative shapes made the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but what is by no means equal to &quot; funny &quot; images .
&quot; on the contrary , the respective topics can be adapted quite dark . &quot;
&quot; approximately three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for which he has made a subjective artistic selection from the many thematic areas of the &quot; &quot; Book of All Books &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; these cycles emerged are cycles , which devote themselves as cross@@ roads , pl@@ agues , commandments , or fa@@ ther@@ our . &quot;
so he has spont@@ aneously fascinated by several partners : this applies to the Lu@@ ther Verlag with his the@@ ological alignment as well as the Kettler @-@ publishing house with its focus on art books .
and there is the author of Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost on the basis of the painting with the respective Bi@@ bel@@ lies .
&quot; it was interpreted by the Ot@@ mar Alt Bi@@ bel@@ es , and thus into the Today , in current contexts . &quot;
these texts are as verbal mirror of al@@ ts .
they are embedded between the original Bi@@ ther and one set of the artist who formulated his very personal thoughts for the situation here .
the jewel has golden letters .
&quot; so the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high level of intimacy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately prof@@ essed even trig@@ gers for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 in Wer@@ nig@@ ero@@ de and raised in Berlin , comes from a family that belon@@ ged to the str@@ ingent Protestant mi@@ tigation . &quot;
&quot; and the education has already happened to the pi@@ k , &quot; re@@ members the Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot;
I have tried to re@@ tire that to perhaps also carry me with the Lord father .
&quot; his second concern is to help art in fast @-@ acting Age : &quot; &quot; the perception of pic@@ ut@@ ches is now shaped by re@@ en@@ ame , and that is loud . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is replaced there .
artists have a different desire and glad@@ ness to show things .
images have always something mysti@@ cal and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ os@@ aur . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants that the contempl@@ ate into the pictures , let them let go , discover and feel that power they have : &quot; &quot; the picture is looking for his counter@@ f@@ using . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost standing on Tuesday at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Art Foundation , &quot; &quot; I always like to be a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art : &quot; I like , how he acts with his pictures life . &quot;
&quot; I have not desp@@ ised to grasp the Bible completely , but selected for him also important , also mysterious themes . &quot;
&quot; this was not collaboration on eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text explains only . &quot;
&quot; for Hans Mö@@ ll@@ mann from the Lu@@ ther @-@ house , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and to find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for se@@ ag@@ ulation both the ( Bi@@ blical ) language of love as well as the responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas Pr@@ ints - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be launched on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt .

&quot; the om@@ is@@ sions in politics and administration with care , especially among the residents who did not toler@@ ate the railways . &quot;
&quot; so , hill was looked at above , a new place - now with form@@ ative planning and application for building approval . &quot;
the authorization will go in October that I would like to inform the First council Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck now in the Children &apos;s and Youth Committee .
&quot; I hope this year does not happen this year , &quot; she said . &quot;

DF@@ B intensified commitment for refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees from 2019 to 2019 ; the Bundes@@ liga sets a clear sign in the weekend .
the football respond to the situation in Germany and sec@@ ures policy when dealing with the problems of tac@@ kling the related problems .
&quot; I consider this to be the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there can in principle no one say that &apos;s nothing about , I have nothing to do with that . &quot;
&quot; this must be interesting to everyone , this issue has to get a grip on this issue , &quot; said DF@@ B &apos;s boss Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; during the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel , on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refuge@@ e situation in Germany . &quot;
&quot; I am next Wednesday in the ch@@ anc@@ ellor and re@@ efs there , the State Department of Ms. O@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the ch@@ anc@@ ellor . &quot;
&quot; since the theme will surely play a central role , &quot; &quot; announced it . &quot;
the football could help and wants to w@@ ool .
but the decisive gra@@ ins must provide policy .
the German football @-@ Bund has therefore expanded its refuge@@ e crisis &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; at four years .
&quot; through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Braun Series , we have ensured that this program is running until 2019 &quot; , &quot; said Sam s@@ bach on the br@@ ink of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
also some Bundes@@ liga support this program .
already at this weekend the 36 pro@@ fi@@ ver@@ a is a clear sign when on the left Tri@@ kot@@ let@@ mel instead of the usual sponsor@@ ing logos ( Herm@@ es ) will help - # C@@ es@@ welcome .
&quot; we also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can only , &quot; said Lever@@ kus@@ en Sport@@ chef &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; Zeitung ( Tuesday ) and marked the project as &quot; &quot; compl@@ ac@@ tion@@ ality &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refuge@@ e @-@ drama goes every one , none can be seen . &quot;
&quot; we can know football @-@ Bundes@@ liga , no , we have to use our strength , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees that have already so incredibly suffered , &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
H@@ offen@@ hei@@ ms Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig said of a &quot; prominent sign of the League . &quot;
the EM @-@ qualification process against Hungary at this Friday invites the national team of women 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
&quot; Nier@@ s@@ bach outlines the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; a great common works of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 roy@@ alties could have started their own projects be great .
&quot; just as great , that small and smallest associations are as active . &quot;
&quot; the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome , &quot; which we spent , is lived in football . &quot;
&quot; that is of huge importance , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in this and next year , the association provides cooperation with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government of 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees . &quot;
&quot; the Ver@@ eine have also called the whole amount for 2015 , reported ren@@ al . &quot;
reports : SAP @-@ St@@ ef loses by accident
&quot; the board of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Derm@@ ott , has lost many reports by an overthrow in early July . &quot;
&quot; in the accident at the Lad@@ der in the house of his brother in the USA he liked after midnight to a water glass , which he carried in the left hand , reports the &quot; &quot; economic Week &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is almost ble@@ eding , was power@@ less , then ran out over to the street - that he told us so last week , &quot; quoted the &quot; Wi@@ er &quot; SAP @-@ Co @-@ founder H@@ asso . &quot;
but Mc@@ Derm@@ ott could go down his work .
&quot; beginning October we meet in front of the Supervisory Board in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said flat . &quot;
the 54 year old manager will be with the meeting and &quot; fully un@@ employed . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Derm@@ ott , announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday morning tour ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue to conduct the software . &quot;
&quot; I fully stand for SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I had all the time in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and the Chairman of the Chairman , said Mc@@ Derm@@ al of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Derm@@ ott is usually between Germany and the USA , but since the summer time he was no more in the German SAP Head@@ quarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; let him be important to pass such a personal story to the public , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; : &quot; everyone can happen so something . &quot;
&quot; important is to stand up again , if you like to come . &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ Re@@ pilot Magn@@ ets apart from the fe@@ eds ...
&quot; Magn@@ ets t@@ wit@@ ter@@ ated a corresponding photo and declared , he suffered the injury , when he over@@ thrown by the wheel . &quot;
&quot; he therefore comes to the after@@ cutting in Singapore on weekends as well as reservation @-@ drivers for the two tribe Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button , like a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan . &quot;
football : Bv@@ B without Re@@ us against Kras@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the Gate
at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us in the first group game of Europa League are final .
the nation @-@ player will also be missing in the Bundes@@ liga of the Bundes@@ liga as well as in the Du@@ el with the F@@ K Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7.00 p.m. / Sky ) .
&quot; we cannot rely on him unfortunately , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; whether Re@@ us on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ top play against Lever@@ kus@@ en again , the BV@@ B @-@ Coach is open : &quot; we expect a return from him to training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; given the high loading of his professionals , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change his tribe but at the Re@@ us position . &quot;
so he announced a change on the go@@ alies position .
therefore Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes place the place from Tribal ke@@ eper Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he trained on an absolute top level , &quot; pra@@ ised the World Teacher of the World Champion . &quot;
&quot; but if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller arrives in future at all European le@@ ague games , Tu@@ ch@@ el left however open . &quot;
with high prob@@ abl@@ ity he will also be riding the second game .
&quot; the for@@ table &apos;s statement from Mit@@ ch Re@@ us that the final aim for the BV@@ B is its target for BV@@ B in the Europa League , the mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l holds for understandable : &quot; &quot; I am not so wrong . &quot;
I think that we have a good chance to access the title .
robot cars : government wants the pioneer in Germany
Germany shall be fron@@ tr@@ un@@ ner following the will of the Federal Government on the change of the car of technological developments .
&quot; the Bundes@@ wi@@ in@@ ett was decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the house of Transport , Alexander Dobr@@ ind@@ t ( C@@ SU ) , which includes investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
Dobr@@ ind@@ t said on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the I@@ AA from a &quot; new mobile era . &quot;
&quot; the automated and networked road will increase road safety and ensure less st@@ aff@@ s , said Dobr@@ ind@@ t . &quot;
&quot; he will also discuss the topic with his counter@@ part from the G@@ 7 states , who will also come together with representatives of the industry with representatives of the industry . &quot;
the Strateg@@ i@@ ep@@ aper of the Department of Transport is empha@@ sized among other things the importance of mobile broad@@ band providers and an advanced conversion in digital radio .
a testing of new technology is currently a test track on the highway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; with the driver &quot; assumes no additional liability risks to the driver &quot; , &quot; the federal government wants to examine the legal framework , and where necessary to adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; for instance , Germany wants to use approximately internationally for this permitted maximum speed for self @-@ driving cars from 10 to 130 kilometers @-@ kilometers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the federal government plans to stand up for a change in the Vienna Convention that has so far failed to see the people as a driver . &quot;
&quot; in automatic chassis , the car takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger . &quot;
technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that record the environment and process data in secon@@ ds@@ quickly .
&quot; following one from the economic mini@@ stries , the study will be submitted to high @-@ automated driving on motor@@ ways to 2020 . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , drive @-@ driven vehicles on public roads &quot; only expected to be expected by 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
value creation in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions in Germany appreciate the authors of the study in 2025 to around 8,@@ 4 billion euros . &quot;
&quot; the digital connectivity of the PK@@ W@@ s can lead to improved safety and efficiency in traffic , &quot; &quot; said the SPD @-@ Transport S@@ ören Bart@@ ol . &quot;
the issue of liability in accidents and the security of personal data of the driver is clear to be clari@@ fied .
&quot; however , the Germans who are still sc@@ ep@@ tical themselves - much more than French or American . &quot;
&quot; one on Wednesday at the AA presented survey of the For@@ sa Institute in behalf of the Ex@@ amin@@ ergi@@ c DE@@ K@@ RA comes to the result , that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonom@@ ous cars are expected to prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent do not believe in it , 31 per cent at all . &quot;
&quot; in France , 21 percent of the respon@@ dents said to 2025 using autonom@@ ous vehicles , in the USA 33 per cent . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely entirely on a self prop@@ elled vehicle . &quot;
&quot; according to a survey of the digital network Bit@@ k@@ om , only seven percent would agree to take control throughout the whole drive on all roads . &quot;
&quot; on the fre@@ eway , this might be able to imagine 15 percent in flowing traffic at approx 15 percent in St@@ au 45 percent . &quot;
good everyone would leave under control to the car under no circumstances .
B@@ oll says team and double start at table tennis @-@ EM
&quot; at present , Düssel@@ dor@@ fer wants to fight for the cover from 25 September to 4 October only . &quot;
the final decision should be handed down at the latest on September 22 .
&quot; that is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; the guys experienced it in the morning , &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough , even without Tim@@ o the title &quot; , &quot; said Ju@@ ra@@ iner Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ ead during the EM @-@ teacher in Düsseldorf . &quot;
the link was based on the flight to a long @-@ term target@@ ing in China at this time .
the 34 year old German champion is expected on Friday .
&quot; without Tim@@ o is the disadvantage , we are now no longer as a clear favorite , &quot; explained single @-@ European spirits of Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot;

&quot; at that time , Tim@@ o also were missing , and we are europe@@ an spirits . &quot;
&quot; because of this we should be oriented , &quot; explained the world list of world lists . &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an En@@ f@@ ant
it is a mix of quite a great fashion show and a w@@ ax@@ e @-@ based Gr@@ us@@ el@@ ace : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : window man@@ nequ@@ ins which are specially fri@@ gh@@ tening thanks to video @-@ proj@@ ections .
&quot; they carry the spectacular creations from the French designer , among other things with Mad@@ onn@@ as Stage @-@ fits to the great star of the mo@@ k scene - and so that he put men in sk@@ irts . &quot;
&quot; today I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant of the Haute Cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; earlier it was born , meanwhile , it is genuine , &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which at the Kuns@@ thalle the HY@@ PO @-@ Cultural Foundation is to see that the Mo@@ des@@ ch@@ ö@@ pfer has changed his initially exp@@ elled attitude towards a show of his person at the beginning of September . &quot;
&quot; actually he had been against it , for : &quot; &quot; for me the exhibition was a bit of death &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot;
if you die , you get into the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously made in the Canadian Montreal and in Paris .
&quot; it is about so much more than just beautiful clothes , &quot; said the director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society . &quot;
&quot; the exhibits give an insight into the hardly ever @-@ looking work of the man , which has written the story without ever having an education . &quot;
&quot; chron@@ ologically , the show is not built , but it is an excellent cho@@ reo@@ graph@@ ed total cont@@ emp@@ t , for which much effort was done : to refres@@ hed the doll@@ s , for example , a sty@@ list was engaged . &quot;
14 tons of material have made the makers according to indications of the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
just before the start of the October legend was still a special treat for a leather goods out@@ fit with cor@@ set .
Heidi meets Madonna .
&quot; he always interested in strong women ( &quot; women are sm@@ arter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ men &apos;s old Ted@@ dy is seen in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , tim@@ id fashionable Geh@@ versuche of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he attracted his Ted@@ dy B@@ HS and garments , said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; playing with a pupp@@ et , his parents would not have allowed him . &quot;
he later followed the design of fashion then .
he was interested in fashion journals and saw himself the designs of other designers like Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
but later I bought the then natural .
for his first own fashion show he did not pay the models .
&quot; they did not have anything , but were allowed to bear the gear . &quot;
jewellery instead of Gar@@ dine - Pl@@ au@@ ener tip as fashion @-@ niche
&quot; earlier , it went to the long bro@@ ider@@ y machines in and around Pl@@ acing about it to be meters . &quot;
&quot; the pop@@ ulate substances and tips were created in large quantities for customers , which they were processed for example to blankets and she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this alone does not work anymore , Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the mar@@ eb@@ itze . &quot;
instead the fashion is important .
&quot; in the initial times of the Pl@@ au@@ ener tip , fashion played a bigger role , then replaced by the hom@@ et@@ ching industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche phenomenon . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : top in jewelry , with accessories such as pockets and with regional chambers . &quot;
&quot; actually bil@@ de the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which rests with past styl@@ istic periods , an increasing @-@ level of potential . &quot;
&quot; those who are not yet served in the textile industry in Germany , is no longer the market . &quot;
with us they already make half of all orders .
Mo@@ eb@@ itze Pl@@ eb@@ es is together with nine further companies member of the branch association Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze and em@@ bro@@ ider@@ ies .
only they may carry the protected label .
&quot; in the last 15 years , around 80 percent of the sales have been broken . &quot;
private stores and also the wholes@@ ale company are almost no longer available .
our products can hardly be achieved in this way .
the mass ware will nowadays be much cheaper in the Asian region and almost exclusively distributed via chains .
&quot; aside the export , current to Russia and the USA . &quot;
there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association is also trying to score points by environmental awareness , such as Cor@@ d@@ ula Bauer from the em@@ bro@@ ider@@ y in Fal@@ ken@@ stein , which shows that we produce a quality seal that we produce environmentally sound and socially toler@@ ated . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt complet@@ es : &quot; this refers to the materials used .
diploma W@@ led Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ eber@@ ger Department of the West@@ ro@@ ächs@@ ische College Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and is specialised in em@@ bro@@ ider@@ ies and tips .
&quot; in order to continue competing in the Asian region , you have to find high quality and innovative products . &quot;
it takes time and courage .
&quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and the factories that must especially be used economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design is often only slightly dependent to hold a customer base . &quot;
a few years ago dear textile designer cat@@ i Re@@ uter the historical snow@@ man tip new .
at the same time the machine is fed into some places .
&quot; the Pl@@ au@@ ener Gold@@ smi@@ ths in Bianca Hall@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Kr@@ au@@ wers has inspired to it , &quot; &quot; previously I could not start anything with traditional pl@@ au@@ ener . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for jewelry .
in a elaborate process they shaped the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people of the region identify with the topic Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; &quot; Re@@ uter . &quot;
&quot; it also delivers to the USA , to Australia and Finland - mainly to customers who have lived their ancestors in Pl@@ ush and the surrounding area , and who want to make a souvenir . &quot;
I see my jewelry as a modern amb@@ assador of pl@@ au@@ ener .

XI presses the economy to open wider for the world
&quot; the economy must open themselves wider to the outside to promote growth , said President Xi Jin@@ ping on Tuesday of a group that was commissioned with the steering of the reform . &quot;
&quot; China should stand up to improve foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for business meetings , &quot; he said in a consultation at the 16th session of the central leadership group to deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; breaking news and promote reforms to advance new momentum and vitality , and offer new space for economic growth , said Xi . &quot;
&quot; the man@@ ag@@ erial group has a set of guidelines adopted , including a neg@@ atives to regulate the market , relaxation of the border controls , promoting state companies ( SO@@ E ) , priv@@ ative capital , and moderni@@ zation of the citizens @-@ milking system . &quot;
&quot; after statement a negative list is created , the sectors and businesses identified that are not ques@@ tioned for investment . &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance because it points to the market a bigger role in the allocation of resources , an illegal business environment is ensured and the market more open , the statement said . &quot;
the Government will also control controls over the powers transmitted to the company and ensure that businesses decide how they perform their business .
&quot; the statement also said that China assumes , new models of cross @-@ border economic co@@ operations and new mechanisms to support regional growth . &quot;
&quot; to open assess@@ ments , further areas are open for private investments . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments , and will protect the legal interests of foreign financing companies and provide better services to them , &quot; &quot; the statement . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is easier to apply for foreigners to apply for a lasting residence permit , or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by optim@@ izing the requirements and the application process will be facilit@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; to guarantee the right of law@@ yers to exercise their activities , and to employ professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot;
&quot; at the meeting , Prime Minister Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders participated like Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli , as described in a statement published after the meeting . &quot;
EU wants to double Mer@@ cury @-@ toler@@ ated de@@ pu@@ ff@@ ers in smoke @-@ fish
the European Commission wants to double the limits for mer@@ cury in big cat@@ er@@ fish and the consumers thus significantly higher dose of nerve situations .
&quot; consumer organisation Food@@ watch , which is a corresponding worker from the EU , cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed the plans to shar@@ p@@ ly : &quot; risks and side effects caused by pregnant and inf@@ ants &quot; , &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t from Food@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t declar@@ es the limits of the nerve toxic for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ pen@@ ing or s@@ word@@ fish for &quot; economic reasons &quot; of one to two milli@@ gram mer@@ cury , depending on the fish . &quot;
&quot; large car@@ ni@@ ffer @-@ fish , however , have already been so strongly stra@@ ined with mer@@ cury that are not permitted on the basis of the existing threshold values approximately 50 percent of the fet@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling of the threshold values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be ven@@ al for sale . &quot;
&quot; in return for this all@@ eged , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limits in other fish from currently 0,5 milli@@ gram to a 0.1 milli@@ gram squ@@ eck@@ silver per kil@@ ograms . &quot;
&quot; Food@@ watch ordered this however as a trick , because smaller gra@@ de@@ fish , like car@@ p are usually charged so low , that they already keep the planned peak levels already today . &quot;
&quot; ab@@ dic@@ ation in Kl@@ einf@@ isch is therefore &quot; an per@@ fi@@ de distr@@ act , which helps the economy alone , &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t . &quot;
Mer@@ cury is one for the people of high po@@ ison@@ ous metals that sh@@ ines through the food chain most especially in smo@@ kers .
&quot; the federal government is therefore war@@ ned that &quot; &quot; already small quantities may cause particularly in the inf@@ ants of the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Federal State of Germany explains its homepage with regard to the applicable high@@ s , but that a &quot; health haz@@ ard &quot; would not be expected . &quot;
Mer@@ cury is mainly driven by the cohesion loss into the environment .
&quot; according to a written information by the German environmental Ministry of German Bundestag Ann@@ alena Ba@@ er@@ bock is more than six tons of mer@@ cury in the year , two thirds of the German co@@ aster total . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of Mer@@ cury in fish lies about in the Elbe River , Rhine and River either &quot; permanently and nationwide , &quot; the &quot; mirror &quot; had quoted in March from the paper . &quot;
last year @-@ wide war@@ nings in front of Mer@@ cury in fish already had the most common health risks in the EU @-@ War@@ n@@ system RA@@ SF@@ F .
