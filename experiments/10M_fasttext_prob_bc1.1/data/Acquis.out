it is cont@@ am@@ inated by human red blood cells that contain the A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ O ) an@@ tigen ( which are not ag@@ glut@@ inated in general by anti @-@ A serum of blood cells of group B ) .
an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is parallel to the again dissolved , but un@@ diluted international standard material of the anti @-@ A blood group or a corresponding comparison , separated against floo@@ ding of A1 and A2 blood cells .
furthermore , it is parallel to the again dissolved , but un@@ diluted international standard of anti @-@ B blood @-@ group@@ ing or a corresponding comparison of B @-@ blood cells .
the efficiency of the serum can not be in no case less than 64 international units per ml .
anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) blood vaccine is also an easy @-@ to @-@ recogni@@ z@@ able ag@@ glut@@ ination of the group A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ O ) .
if an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed on an object carrier with same amounts of 5 - to 10@@ percent floo@@ ding within the double time , which is necessary if the same attempts to de@@ file the anti @-@ A blood group or with a standard prepared desired activity .
anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) Serum is mixed with a same amount of 5 to 10@@ percent floo@@ ding B @-@ blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double time , which is necessary if the same attempt is dissolved in the anti @-@ B blood group or a standard pre@@ par@@ at equal to Avi@@ o .
if an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) Serum is mixed with the same amount of a 5- to 10@@ percent floo@@ ding of A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ O ) blood disorders , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within 5 minutes at a temperature of 18 to 25 Â° C .
anti @-@ R@@ h blood @-@ group@@ ing sera each speci@@ fic@@ ity can be one of two types that distinguish themselves through the prer@@ equ@@ is@@ ites , among which one ag@@ glut@@ ination is achieved hom@@ olog@@ ous blood cells .
with others that can be called &quot; in@@ completely &quot; , an ag@@ glut@@ ination can only be achieved in presence of certain col@@ lo@@ id such as beef alb@@ umen , or with the help of other special methods .
some &quot; in@@ complete &quot; Ser@@ a ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ate on object carriers also hom@@ olog@@ ous red blood cells , which are harvest@@ ed in their own serum or plasma .
the following requirements for the efficacy of Ser@@ a for the determination of the R@@ h Group may possibly change if International standard award @-@ par@@ ate are available . i ) Anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood group serum ( human )
anti @-@ D serum is extracted from the blood of one or several individuals who are immune to the an@@ tigen D of the R@@ h @-@ System .
it re@@ acts with human red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen D , but not with human red blood cells , which does not contain the an@@ tigen D .
&quot; complete &quot; anti @-@ D Ser@@ a must have a tit@@ er of at least 1 : 32 compared to C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in a 0,@@ 9@@ percent cook@@ ery solution .

in addition to a reaction with all red blood cells , which contain the an@@ tigen D , the serum should contain ble@@ eding with ble@@ eding , the do @-@ an@@ tigen contain , react .
anti @-@ D Ser@@ a , who are intended to use object carriers according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , have to be mixed with the same amount of a 40@@ - to 50@@ percent floo@@ ding of C@@ c@@ De@@ e @-@ blood cells in about 40 seconds , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds .
anti @-@ C serum is extracted from the blood of one or several individuals who are immun@@ ised by the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ogen C of the R@@ h @-@ Systems .
it respon@@ ds to floo@@ ding human blood cells which contain an@@ tigen C but not with human red blood cells , which do not contain the C @-@ an@@ tigen .
therefore , these Ser@@ a are therefore specifically specific to the C @-@ an@@ tigen , when the tested blood cells in a 0,@@ 9@@ percent cook@@ ery solution are im@@ it@@ ated .
