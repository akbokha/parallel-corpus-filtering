this document is a summary of the European public assessment report ( EP@@ AR ) , in which explains how the Committee for Human @-@ Comp@@ ensation ( CH@@ MP ) has performed the conducted studies in order to access recommendations concerning the application of medication .
if you need more information about your disease or treatment , please refer to the packet instructions ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or consult your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if you require further information regarding the recommendations of the CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg melting tablet ( tablets which dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution for inser@@ ting ( 1 mg / ml ) and as a injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. effective thinking and speaking , Hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or view of things , which are not present ) , mist@@ rust and mad@@ ness ; • bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a mental illness , in which patients have defic@@ iency ( periods of abnormal high spirits ) altern@@ ately with periods of normal mood .
A@@ bil@@ led is used to treat medium to severe adverse episodes and pre@@ vent@@ ative episodes of patients who have been in the past in the past .
injection solution is applied for rapid control of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al trou@@ bles when the intake of the medicine is not possible .
for both ill@@ nesses , the solution can be used for inser@@ ting or processed cheese in patients that make the swal@@ low of tablets difficulties .
in patients , taking other medicines at the same time , the dose of A@@ bil@@ led should be reduced .
this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ itter , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of the nerve cells .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole probably works as &quot; partial Ag@@ onist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine ( also called ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ ev@@ amine like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine and d@@ op@@ amine , but in less measurements than the ne@@ ural sm@@ itter effect to activate the recept@@ ors .
since d@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine with sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and bi@@ polar failure to play a role in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , thereby reducing the psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms .
the efficacy of A@@ bil@@ isi , the rest@@ ation of the symptoms , was investigated in three studies over up to one year .
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared with 8@@ 05 patients with sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia or similar diseases resulting in increased un@@ rest , over a period of two hours with a placebo .
in another study , A@@ bil@@ led was compared to 347 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l , in another study conducted the efficacy of A@@ bil@@ led and placebo which had already been stabil@@ ized on 160 patients , with which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabil@@ ized with A@@ bil@@ led .
the efficacy of A@@ bil@@ id injection solution was diagnosed in a study of 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder suffering from increased un@@ rest , compared to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ica ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change in patients were examined by a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to the treatment .
the company also led studies to investigate how the body uses the melting tablet and the solution to remove res@@ or@@ ously ( up ) .
in both studies with the injection solution , patients who received A@@ bil@@ isi in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9,@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms like patients who received a placebo .
in the application for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bil@@ led decreased in four of the five short @-@ time studies of man@@ ic symptoms effective as placebo .
in addition , A@@ bil@@ led was prevented for up to 74 weeks in more effective than placebo for re @-@ perform episodes of previously treated patients and when it was also given to an existing treatment .
asp@@ bil@@ led inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses have also been reduced effective as placebo which prov@@ oked un@@ rest and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common adverse events of A@@ bil@@ isi ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) , head@@ ache ( constant movement ) , head@@ ache ( constant movement ) , sc@@ ath@@ ic hyper@@ secre@@ tion ( increased memory production ) , fatigue and creation ( increased memory production ) , red@@ ness and exhau@@ st@@ ion , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxi@@ ety .
in contrast to the conclusion that the advantages of ag@@ ronom@@ y in the treatment of sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and medium @-@ heavy @-@ severe episodes of patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes and with the pre@@ vent@@ ative episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , opposed to the risks of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in addition , the Committee came to the result that the advantages of the inj@@ ectors of distur@@ b@@ ance and behavi@@ our@@ al trou@@ bles in patients with sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia or patients with man@@ ic@@ op@@ hren@@ ia or patients with man@@ ic@@ op@@ hren@@ ia is bi@@ polar @-@ I failure , when an oral therapy is not suitable .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd . an approval for the placing on the market of A@@ bil@@ isi in the entire European Union .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is responsible for the treatment of severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new defic@@ ien@@ cies in patients , mainly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a dose of 15 mg / day , regardless of meals .
an increased effectiveness in doses above a daily dose of 15 mg was not detected , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
efficacy of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I@@ - disorder in patients ≥ 65 years was not detected .
with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initi@@ ation dose should be considered as clinical factors are just@@ ify ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurr@@ ence of su@@ ic@@ idal behaviour belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ecting disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after change of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.8 ) .
results of a ep@@ idemi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder , an elevated su@@ ic@@ idal risk of Ari@@ j@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was opposed to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ica compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ica .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be treated with care in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ) , her@@ cin@@ ogenic diseases , conditions which are prescribed for h@@ yp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , Hyp@@ ov@@ ol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure sensitive drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ zel@@ er@@ ated and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .
3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which was a year or less , there was occas@@ ional reports on treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole dy@@ sent@@ ing dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis .
if the patients treated with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y treated the signs and symptoms of a late dy@@ nasty , should be taken into consideration the dose should reduce or the treatment .
if a patient under@@ mark the signs and symptoms , which has to interpre@@ t a m@@ ns , or un@@ clear fever without an additional clinical manifest@@ ation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ica must be removed , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
therefore Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used in patients with c@@ amp@@ as in the an@@ am@@ ous or with condition that are used to be treated with caution .
56 - 99 years old with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psych@@ osis which were associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , an increased risk of death compared to placebo .
there were however , in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between dosage and response to un@@ wanted rov@@ ascular events with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole patients .
hyper@@ glyc@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ azi@@ van or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients who were treated with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic effects including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
there is no exc@@ essive risk assessment for hyper@@ glyc@@ emia related events with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic effects of patients treated with direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ phen@@ ols , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie , and weakness , patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , should be monitored regularly in regard to a deteri@@ oration of the gl@@ ucose levels .
a weight gain is generally used in sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ ens patients and patients with bi@@ polar defic@@ ien@@ cies due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ d@@ ities , the application of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain as a side effects , and may lead to severe complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nerv@@ ous system , it is charged if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is used in combination with alcohol or other centrally @-@ effective drugs related side effects as se@@ dation ( see Section 4.8 ) .
the H2 ant@@ agon@@ ist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ ine , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Chin@@ id@@ in ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected to expect another highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , similar effects and therefore should be done similar dose reductions .
in CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ ism can cause the joint application with high effective in@@ verteb@@ rates of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in comparison to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ dable Met@@ abol@@ ism .
if you consider the common gift of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or other highly effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , the potential benefit should have potential risks for patients .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and HIV prot@@ ease , have to be able to have similar effects and therefore should be done similar dose reductions .
after placing the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors the dose of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y would be lifted to the Dos@@ ish@@ ist prior to the start of the accompanying therapy .
di@@ lem@@ an or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram , or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , can be calculated with a constant increase of Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical trials , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ y@@ opia showed no significant effect on the metabolism of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ method@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( War@@ bird ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( Om@@ ep@@ ra@@ zol ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
due to the in@@ sufficient data of security in humans and due to the impair@@ ment of the animal , this drug may not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential benefit is the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , in other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics the patients have been warned of warning , dangerous machines , including power vehicles , to operate , until they ensure that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on it .
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medical @-@ related side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined by the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study about 52 weeks occurred in patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ ole , a total of less incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) from EPS , including par@@ c@@ son@@ ism , ac@@ ath@@ ouse , D@@ yst@@ ony and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia compared to patients who were treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l ( 5@@ 7,3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19 % was treated in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study of over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % was treated in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ ama and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in therapy .
Man@@ ic episodes with bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks was the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients under Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l treatment .
in another study about 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase , more than 26 weeks during a placebo @-@ controlled study was the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo treated patients .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo which potentially clin@@ ically controlled laboratory parameters were detected , there was no medi@@ cally significant differences .
enh@@ ancements of CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ ine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and as@@ y@@ mptom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of the patients with Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ z@@ ole patients , compared to 2.0 % of treated patients .
among the adverse events which may occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic treatment , the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ pt@@ osis syndrome , sp@@ ear@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis , and increased mortality rate of de@@ men@@ tia patients , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch have been un@@ inten@@ tional , or deliber@@ ate over@@ dos@@ si@@ ations with an estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg in adult patients with an estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg .
although there are no information about the effectiveness of a hem@@ at@@ di@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dosage with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ; however , it is un@@ likely that hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dosage value is because Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma cutting .
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance via the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and Ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and a ant@@ agon@@ ist effect on ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors is medi@@ ated .
in vitro , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a high aff@@ inity to D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 @-@ receptor as well as an incredible aff@@ inity to D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 4- , to the ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7- , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ ad@@ r@@ ins@@ ane and for hist@@ amine @-@ H1@@ recept@@ ors .
in the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in dos@@ ages from 0,5 up to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks in healthy volunteers the Pos@@ it@@ ans emissions reductions of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d showed a D2 / D3 @-@ receptor , a D2 / D3 @-@ receptor , at the nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and on the Put@@ t .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1.@@ 228 sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ ens patients with positive or negative symptoms showed an statistically significant stronger improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms .
in a half @-@ controlled study , 52 of the proportion of patients who participated in study medication should be similar to study medication , in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales , which were defined as secondary study rates , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ g@@ ery scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than in Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study , more than 26 weeks in stabil@@ ized patients with chronic sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia showed significantly higher reduction in response rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % under placebo .
in a O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study included in sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 314 patients had decreased significantly less patients at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with a more flexible dose over 3 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I failure , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a placebo over placebo over 3 weeks in reducing clinical symptoms .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study about 3 weeks with fixed dosage of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I failure , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior effectiveness compared to placebo .
in two plac@@ eb@@ o- and active @-@ controlled Mon@@ otherapy studies for 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psychological characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a comparison to placebo over placebo in week 3 and a lasting effect , which was comparable to lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l in week 12 .
in week Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole reported 12 a comparable proportion of patients with sy@@ mptom@@ atic remission of the man@@ ia on like Lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study about 6 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I failure , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , which partially over 2 weeks did not reflect on lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at @-@ Mon@@ otherapy , the accompanying therapy associated with Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ yl@@ benzene found a superior effectiveness in the reduction of man@@ ic symptoms compared to Mon@@ otherapy with lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study about 26 weeks , followed by a long @-@ term expansion lasting more than 74 weeks before Rand@@ om@@ isation during a stabil@@ isation period before Rand@@ om@@ isation revealed a remission compared to placebo in regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar return , mainly in the prevention of a retreat in the Man@@ ie .
based on in vitro studies the enzy@@ mes CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the strain dri@@ fting and hydro@@ xy@@ red@@ ness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ rie is catal@@ y@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean elim@@ ination time is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in an extensive met@@ abolic syndrome via CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and for almost 146 hours at &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ ism over CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics between male and female healthy subjects , as well as a pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic investigation did not show gender @-@ dependent patients .
a pop @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics revealed no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences in eth@@ nic@@ ity or the effect of smoking to pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ oni was similar in patients with severe cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study involving human liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ P@@ ug@@ h class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the influence of liver function on pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of Arizona , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of class C , which is not enough to pull loops on their met@@ abolic capacity .
based on conventional studies on safety @-@ har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repet@@ itive gift , re@@ productive tox@@ icity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and for can@@ o@@ gens potential the pre@@ clinical data had no particular haz@@ ards in human beings .
tox@@ ic@@ ec@@ ologically significant effects were observed only with dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions , which exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure of people , so they have limited liability for clinical use only or no significance .
the effects recorded a dos@@ sier @-@ dependent on tox@@ icity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ c@@ ine @-@ pigment cum@@ ulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) during rats to 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to 10 times the mean Ste@@ ady @-@ State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ p was found as a result of the removal of sul@@ fate @-@ con@@ jug@@ ate in the G@@ all of apes after repeated oral gift of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1- to triple ) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ fold of the recommended maximum dose when people is based on mg / m2 .
however , at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found in the highest recommended daily dose of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole no more than 6 % of the concentrations , which were found in the study about 39 weeks in the g@@ all of monkeys , and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) in vitro sol@@ u@@ bility .
these effects were observed in rab@@ bits which resulted in ex@@ positions of 3- and 11@@ fold of the mean Ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a main study , in which 460 women have participated in metastatic breast cancer , in which about three quarters were formerly known as anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in several gift and as mon@@ otherapy ) has been compared to the medication ( given in combination with other medicines for reducing side effects ) .
in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 229 with Abra@@ x@@ ane was treated to the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients treated with conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
consider only the patients that were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , there were no difference between the disease progression or deteri@@ oration in terms of disease and survival .
in contrast , in patients that had received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer , in terms of these indicators , Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing medicines .
it also may not be applied to people who have low neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ ic speeds in the blood before beginning of treatment .
the Medic@@ ines Committee ( CH@@ MP ) noted that Abra@@ x@@ ane contained in people where the first treatment is no longer any more effective than conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing medicines that it has to be given to other medicines with other medicines to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission granted approval bi@@ os@@ c@@ ience Limited appro@@ ving the placing of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is inde@@ xed for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with which the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease is missing and is not indicated for the standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ contained therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( Neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ ic number &lt; 0.50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or heavier neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 .
in sen@@ sor@@ i@@ neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y Grade 3 the treatment is to break down until a improvement is achieved at degree 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
currently no suff@@ iciently data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with mild to consistent impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
there were no studies of patients with imp@@ aired kidney function and currently no suff@@ iciently data on the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see paragraph 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to non @-@ sufficient data to in@@ compreh@@ ension and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is a alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound Nan@@ ot@@ arti@@ kel@@ formulation of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el which might have a significantly other pharmac@@ ological characteristics as other for@@ ums of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
when an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be removed immediately and a sy@@ mptom@@ atic treatment should be treated , and the patient must not be treated with P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in the patient no further Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be re@@ directed until the neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ ic number has increased again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes increased again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with heavy liver function ( Bil@@ ir@@ ub@@ in &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
whereas an un@@ il@@ ous x@@ ane was not detected in the related kar@@ di@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , cardiovascular problems are un@@ usually unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or based cardi@@ ac or lung disease .
in case of patients after the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting and di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , these can be treated with the usual anti @-@ emet@@ ics and persistent funds .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant or women at age age , which are no effective conception , unless the treatment of mother with P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is in@@ handy .
women in age@@ able age should take up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane to apply a reliable prevention method .
male patients that are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane will be stim@@ ulated while and up to six months after the treatment no child are witnesses .
male patients should be advised against treatment over a sperm con@@ gest@@ ation because the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertil@@ ity .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects like fatigue ( very frequently ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( frequently ) that can effect on the traffic light and the ability to serve machines .
following are the most common and most important occurr@@ ences of adverse events that occurred in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer , which were once treated in the pi@@ vot@@ al Phase III trial once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie was the most striking important hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ( 79 % of patients reported ) and was quickly reversible and dos@@ sier . Leu@@ k@@ open@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane patients and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
in Table 1 the side effects are listed in conjunction with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy at any dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .
occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased risk @-@ hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ orus in blood , increased potassium in blood , reduced potassium in blood diseases :

o@@ hel@@ o@@ fluid 1 The frequency of over@@ sensitivity re@@ actions is calculated based on a defin@@ itive link in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
since these events were reported on voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of actual frequency is possible and there was no correlation with these events .
P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti @-@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli active ingredient reducing the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tube agent and stabil@@ izes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli by inhibit@@ ing their depression .
this stabil@@ ization leads to a inhibit@@ ing of the normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network which is essential for the vit@@ ale inter@@ phase and the exotic cell functions .
it is known that Alb@@ um@@ osis has been medi@@ ated in the endo@@ thel@@ ial cells and within the framework of in @-@ vitro studies proved that the presence of Alb@@ um@@ in the transport of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is supported by endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
it is believed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ ti@@ eli@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ album Ac@@ cept@@ ors and due to the alb@@ um@@ eric protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accum@@ ulation in the area of the tum@@ ors occurs .
the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two single @-@ blind studies and 4@@ 54 patients that were treated in a randomised phase III study .
in a study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with metastatic breast cancer , which was given in the form of an infusion of 30 minutes , with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an infusion of 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this mul@@ tic@@ entr@@ e study was conducted in patients with metastatic breast cancer , which received every 3 weeks a mon@@ otherapy with P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour infusion with relief measures for the prevention of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as 30 @-@ minute infusion without pre@@ medi@@ ation ( N = 229 ) .
during the inclusion in the study , 64 % of patients had an imp@@ lied general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 met@@ ast@@ as@@ est@@ ates .
14 % of patients had not yet received chemotherapy , 27 % had only a adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ ases and 19 % because of metast@@ ases and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the general response rate and time until progression free survival and survival for patients who received &gt; First @-@ line therapy are explained below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity compared to P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced an peripheral neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y Grade 3 therapy while therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y regarding Bas@@ eline because of cum@@ ulative tox@@ icity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and is still unknown .
pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of Total P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute inf@@ usi@@ ons of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical studies .
the natural exposure exposition ( AU@@ C ) increased linear from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml of analog to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 According to an intraven@@ ous gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration took off a multifunctional mode .
the average distribution volume amounted to 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume has an extensive ex@@ trav@@ as@@ cul@@ ous distribution and / or wheat @-@ binding of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study of patients with advanced sound tum@@ ors , the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic properties of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 minutes for intraven@@ ous 30 minutes , with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 solvent containing P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the cle@@ aring of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ gift ( 43 % ) than after a solvent containing P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and also the distribution volume was at Abra@@ x@@ ane higher ( 53 % ) .
in the literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue coating is reported that P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is met@@ abolic in first line to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed .
after a 30 @-@ minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer was reduced to 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the metabolism 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which indicates a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al cle@@ aring .
over patients at the age of more than 75 years , however , only few data are available , since only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics analysis .
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and light over 8 hours before light .

in patients with normal blood gl@@ ucose levels , it may occur in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion complications , if it is not possible in connection with a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml .
treatment with se@@ per@@ ate must be led under the supervision of a physician , which has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases , which is indicated for the medicine .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want an own blood flow , Ab@@ se@@ fl@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein .
injection can also be made by the patient or his coun@@ sel@@ er@@ son , if they have received a reasonable guidance .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al failure , or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ s should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl of children ) .
the iron values of all patients are to ensure that no iron defic@@ iency exists , and iron supplements should be given throughout the treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ emia can be caused by a Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ oi@@ et@@ in@@ man@@ gel , or so that the body does not suff@@ iciently affect the body &apos;s own er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ oi@@ et@@ in .

it is produced by one cell where a gene was brought into a gene ( DNA ) , which it is ready for formation of ep@@ och in al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ ap@@ sed was compared with an injection in a v@@ ein in the context of a main study with 479 patients who caused an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems , compared to reference problems .
all patients participating in this study was inj@@ ected at least eight weeks of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a V@@ ene before they were either sent to Ab@@ se@@ amed or continue to E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main Indi@@ c@@ ator for the effectiveness was the change in hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin values between the beginning of the study and the distribution period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also put the results of a study in which the effects were investigated by the skin spec@@ ulated dro@@ pping by those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy .
in the study with patients who had caused an@@ a@@ emia were caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ds were killed in the same degree as among the patients who still received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , the patients continued to have E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , an increase of 0,0@@ 63 g / dl of the output value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effects of ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure that occasionally lead to sympt@@ om of a bovine spongiform encephalopath@@ y ( brain problems ) such as sudden , st@@ aging mig@@ raine head@@ ache and confusion .
se@@ ap@@ sed cannot be applied to patients , possibly over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against ep@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa or one of the other parts .
Ab@@ se@@ amed as injection of the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that no allergic reactions are triggered .
the Committee on Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the drug has been demonstrated in accordance with the provisions of the European Union of proof that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .

An@@ a@@ mi@@ es@@ y@@ mptom@@ ome and fol@@ lic@@ ations can be different depending on age , gender and total disease load ; therefore , the assessment of individual clinical trials and disease is necessary due to the doctor .
an increase in hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ s by more than 2 g / dl ( 1,25 m@@ mol / l ) should be avoided for a period of four weeks .
due to the vari@@ ability of patients a single hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ s can occasionally be observed or under the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ s target concentration .
in view of this hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ vari@@ ability the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin targets should be tempted by 10 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) .
if the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ s increased by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mol / l ) per month , or if the permanent hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin value is 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) , the ep@@ et@@ ine @-@ al@@ fa dosage is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that ep@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa in the lowest approved dose , which is required for the control of an@@ a@@ emia and An@@ di@@ mi@@ es@@ y@@ mptom@@ s@@ s .

8 In patients with chronic ren@@ al failure , the recommended limit for hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin targets should not be exceeded under section 4.2 .
in clinical trials , increased mortality risk and risk for severe cardiovascular events were observed when Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ ese stim@@ ulating substances ( ESA ) were given with a hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ oc@@ ene target concentration of more than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have no significant benefit that is attributable to the gift of ep@@ och@@ es , if the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ s is increased over the concentration of the do@@ es@@ y@@ mptom@@ s@@ s and prevention of blood trans@@ f@@ usi@@ ons .
the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin increase should not exceed 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mol / l ) per month to minim@@ ize the risk of an increase in hyper@@ tension .
patients with chronic ren@@ al failure and clinical @-@ suff@@ iciency failure should not be exceeded under Section 4.2 recommended upper limit for hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin targets .
after the present findings , the treatment of an@@ emia with ep@@ och@@ in al@@ fa in adults with kidney suff@@ iciency , which are still not di@@ aly@@ sis , that progression @-@ in@@ suff@@ iciency is not accelerated .
in tumour patients , chemotherapy was supposed to be taken into account for the assessment of the therapeutic efficiency of ep@@ och in al@@ fa with a 2 - 3 weeks delay between ep@@ et@@ ine @-@ al@@ fa gift and the Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ in response ( patients who may be tran@@ sc@@ aled ) .
if the H@@ b increase is exceeded than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mol / l ) per month , or a h@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mol / l ) , the dose must minim@@ ize the risk of possible thro@@ mb@@ otic events ( see Section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies , c@@ auti@@ stic value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision for use re@@ combin@@ ant Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk factor under the participation of the respective patients who should consider the specific clinical context .
in patients who are intended for a larger electronic orthop@@ a@@ edi@@ c intervention , if possible , before the beginning of the ep@@ och in @-@ al@@ fa therapy , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia were examined and treated accordingly .
patients receiving a bigger elec@@ tive or@@ tho@@ don@@ tic surgery should receive an adequate risk of thro@@ mb@@ osis and v@@ ascular diseases , especially at an ab@@ ov@@ able cardiovascular disease .
Moreover , it cannot be excluded , that in treatment with ep@@ och in al@@ fa for patients with a starting sample value of &gt; 13 g / dl provides an increased risk for postoperative thro@@ mb@@ otic / v@@ ascular events .
in several controlled studies , for ep@@ et@@ ine , it was unable to improve the overall survival in tumour patients with sy@@ mptom@@ atic an@@ emia .

in the open study no difference in overall survival between the patients with re@@ combin@@ ant human Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ in treated patients and control patients .
in these studies , patients with re@@ combin@@ ant human Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ in treated patients with an@@ emia was consistent with an@@ emia due to various common mal@@ ign@@ omas , statistically significantly higher mortality than in controls .
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in incidence of thro@@ mb@@ osis and related complications with re@@ combin@@ ant human Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ in treated patients and controls .
there is an increased risk for th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ic events in tumour patients who are treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ in , and a negative impact on the overall survival can not be excluded .

A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is used for the treatment of the following diseases : oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis ( a disease which makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both for women and in males .
it is applied in patients with a high risk risk ( bone breaks ) , including patients who have recently suffered a low @-@ trau@@ matic boun@@ cy such as H@@ inf@@ in ; • Mor@@ avian Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changed the normal process of the bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ avian Pa@@ get can take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with boun@@ cing surgery should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or by injection into a muscle .
the administration of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( funds against inflamm@@ ation ) shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a may reduce the symptoms occurring in the three days following the infusion , such as fever , muscle pain , and severe symptoms , joint pain and head@@ ache .
for the treatment of Mor@@ ning Pa@@ get A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease .
because the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
in the first study , nearly 8 000 elderly women with oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis was involved , and the number of verteb@@ ra@@ e and hip fra@@ c@@ tures were examined over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis more than 50 years , who had suffered a hat@@ s of hat@@ s ; the number of fra@@ c@@ tures were examined over a period of up to five years .
for Mor@@ ning Pa@@ get A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was tested in two trials to a total of 357 patients and compared to six months with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( a other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) .
the main Indi@@ c@@ ator for the effectiveness was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in the serum ( an enzyme called bone sub@@ stan@@ z ) in the blood decreased or at least 75 % compared with the initial value .
in the study with older women the risk of verteb@@ rates in patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( without other oste@@ op@@ or@@ os@@ em@@ e@@ em@@ edi@@ ente ) reduces over a period of three years compared to the patients under placebo by 70 % .
in comparison of all patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( with or without any other oste@@ op@@ or@@ os@@ em@@ edi@@ ble ) , the risk of boun@@ cy was reduced by 41 % .
in the study involving men and women with hip structure , 9 % of patients were treated under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a a fra@@ cture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most adverse events of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a occur in the first three days after infusion and are less frequent in repeated inf@@ usi@@ ons .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a may not be applied to patients , possibly over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or one of the other components .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ads , patients at A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a are subject to the risk of kidney failure , reactions to the infusion point and oste@@ op@@ ec@@ rose ( extin@@ ction of bone tissue ) in a pine .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a manufactures re@@ conn@@ aissance material for doctors , which contains A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a for the treatment of oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis , as well as similar material for patients , in which the effects of the drugs are explained and noted when they should consult the doctor .
in April 2005 the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ art@@ is Europ@@ harm Limited approval for placing the placing of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a throughout the European Union .

treatment of oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis • post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women • in men with an increased risk of fra@@ c@@ tures , including patients with a recent un@@ disp@@ uted low @-@ trau@@ matic collapse .
for the post @-@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis and oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis in men an intraven@@ ous infusion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended once a year .
in patients with low @-@ trau@@ matic holes , the administration of the infusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended two or more weeks after the operating supply of the hat@@ s ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of Mor@@ ning Pa@@ get A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a should only be prescribed by physicians , experience in the treatment of Mor@@ avian Pa@@ get .
after a treatment of the Mor@@ ning Pa@@ get to A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a a long R@@ emis@@ si@@ onal period was observed in patients who have been addressed to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is very advis@@ able to ensure a sufficient supply of calcium , corresponding to at least 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recent un@@ disp@@ uted low @-@ trau@@ matic error correction , a initi@@ al@@ dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 is recommended for oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D before the first A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a infusion is recommended .
the pre@@ valence of symptoms , which occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , may be reduced from A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a &apos;s gift using A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a &apos;s application .
patients with kidney dysfunction ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended because limited clinical experiences for this patient group .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A Dos@@ age adap@@ tion is not necessary because the bio availability , distribution and elim@@ ination of older patients is similar to younger .
children and adolescents A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age because data are missing and efficacy .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , since this patient population lies only limited clinical experiences .
an existing hypo@@ kal@@ ine is before the start of therapy with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a due to sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the rapid integration of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone structure , a temporary , mit@@ ig@@ ated sy@@ mptom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ ine can develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the infusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see Section 4.8 ) .
in addition , it is very advis@@ able to ensure a sufficient supply of calcium , corresponding twice daily at least 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer disease , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ero@@ ids , bad oral hygiene ) should be detected before applying bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate a dental examination with appropriate pre@@ defined dental treatment .
for patients who need dental handles , no data is available if the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses in the field of jaw .
the clinical assessment by the treated doctor should be the basis for treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms , which occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , may be reduced from A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a &apos;s gift using A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a &apos;s application ( see Section 4.2 ) .
the pre@@ valence of serious side effects reported by pre@@ hop@@ ed numbers was increased in patients who received A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received placebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 852 ) .
in the oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis studies ( PFT , HOR@@ IZ@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ gent Fra@@ cture Trial Chamber &#91; RF@@ T &#93; ) was comparable to placebo ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) .
very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occas@@ ional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) un@@ desirable medicines are listed in Table 1 .
kidney @-@ interference C@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was associated with kidney dysfunction ( i.e. an increase in serum @-@ cre@@ at@@ ine ) and in rare cases as the acute cardi@@ ac failure .
the change in the cre@@ at@@ ine Clear@@ ance ( measured before the administration ) and the occurr@@ ence of kidney failure and a reduced kidney function were similar to oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis during three years between the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum @-@ cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine within 10 days of administration was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated patients compared to 0.8 % of treated patients .
based on analysis of laboratory data the temporary calcium values , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation area ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mol / l ) , at 2.3 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in a large clinical trial patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in the Mor@@ avian @-@ Pa@@ get @-@ studies .
all patients received adequate amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study on post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis , in the study to prevent clinical fra@@ c@@ tures after a hat@@ s and in the Mor@@ avian @-@ Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study on avoid@@ ance of clinical fra@@ c@@ tures after a recently revised th@@ rift , the B1 @-@ D mirror was not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , but the majority of the patients received a initi@@ al@@ dosage of vitamin D before the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see Section 4.2 ) .
local reactions According to the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions to the infusion , such as tubes , sw@@ elling and / or pain ( 0.7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sen in the or@@ chards region was mainly reported in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sen ( primary in the or@@ tho@@ red region ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ades , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
many of these patients had the signs for local infections , including oste@@ opath@@ itis , and the majority of reports rel@@ ates to cancer patients to dental vene@@ er or other dental instruments .
7 study involving 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose in a pine forest with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and a placebo treated with placebo .
in case of an over@@ dosage which leads to a clinical relevant hypo@@ kal@@ ine , may be achieved through the gift of oral calcium and / or an intraven@@ ous infusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate to compens@@ ate .
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post @-@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis ( PFT ) once a year for 3 consecutive years ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women aged between 65 and 89 years ) with either one bone dens@@ ity@@ - ( BM@@ D ) and at least two light or a medium @-@ existing ed@@ itary con@@ gest@@ ion , or a BM@@ D @-@ T score for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ as ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing cycl@@ ine structure .
effects on morph@@ ometric cycl@@ ine fac@@ tions A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a significantly decreased over a period of three years and already after one year the incidence of one or more new verteb@@ rates ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated patients of 75 years and older had a reduced risk for sp@@ inal sex fra@@ c@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.0@@ 001 ) .
effects on hip fra@@ c@@ tures A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a reported a constant effect over three years , which resulted in a reduced risk of boun@@ cing fra@@ c@@ tures in one by 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on the bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a increased the bone density at the l@@ um@@ bar ag@@ ic acid , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 % increase of the bone density of l@@ um@@ bar sp@@ ine by 6.7 % , the total th@@ igh increased by 6.0 % , the scra@@ per reduced by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology At 152 post @-@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ op@@ or@@ otic patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) were taken from the third annual dose of bone bi@@ op@@ sies from the pel@@ vic mud .
a micro@@ computer@@ ised tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated patients compared to placebo a increased bone volume and receipt of the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone architecture .
bone mar@@ ital markings markings ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal prop@@ ep@@ ti@@ d of type @-@ coll@@ agen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C @-@ T@@ elop@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum samples were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1.@@ 246 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during the study period .
treatment with an annual 5 mg dose A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months significantly by 30 % compared to the initial value and was kept at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was reduced significantly by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , but the majority of the patients received a initial dose of vitamin D ( 50.000 to 12@@ 5,000 but oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular ) 2 weeks before infusion .
the total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) in the HOR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ RF@@ T study increased the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment in comparison to placebo treatment the BM@@ D on the total th@@ igh and scra@@ pers of all points .
the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment led over 24 months in comparison to placebo treatment an increase of the BM@@ D around 5.4 % in total and 4.3 % on the cran@@ k@@ h@@ als .
clinical efficacy in males In the HOR@@ IZ@@ ON RF@@ T study were random@@ ized to 508 men and 185 patients were evaluated by the BM@@ D after 24 months .
the study was not designed to demonstrate a reduction in clinical fra@@ c@@ tures in men ; the frequency of clinical fra@@ c@@ tures was 7.5 % in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated males compared to 8.7 % in placebo .
in another study involving men ( CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 23@@ 08 ) , the once annual administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was included in comparison to the percentage change of the bar verteb@@ ra BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value .
clinical efficacy of treatment with Mor@@ ning Pa@@ get of the bone A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was examined in patients and patients at the age of 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed morph@@ ine Pa@@ get of the bone ( middle serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to 2.@@ 6@@ fold up to 3.@@ 0@@ fold specific upper standard value for inclusion in the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an infusion of 5 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is taken once daily during 2 months during a period of 2 months compared to comparative studies .
in the combined results , a similar decrease of pain level and pain was observed in comparison to the initial value for A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at after 6 months .
patients who were classified as respon@@ ding to the therapy at the end of the six @-@ month main study ( on therapy ) could be taken up in a follow @-@ up phase .
of the 143 with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate patients who took part in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic contact could be kept at 141 of the patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a compared to 71 of the patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate patients during a mean follow @-@ up period of 18 months after application .
one @-@ time and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting infusion of inf@@ usi@@ ons of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic data that referred to as dos@@ is@@ an .
after this , the plasma concentration increased rapidly to &lt; 10 % of the highest value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 hours , followed by a long lasting phase , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
mixed @-@ phase dis@@ appearance from the large cycle with half @-@ life t ½ α 0.@@ 24 and t ½ to 1.@@ 87 hours , followed by a long elim@@ ination phase with a scheduled elim@@ ination period t ½ g 146 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above t ½ -@@ values ) probably represent the fast res@@ or@@ ption in the bone and the de@@ position of the kidneys .
in the first 24 h 39 ± 16 % of the approved dose in the ur@@ ine , while the rest is mainly bound to the bone tissue .
the total body Clear@@ ance is independent of the dose of 5,@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the infusion period of 5 to 15 minutes resulted in the decrease of the tick @-@ acid concentration by 30 % at the end of infusion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration of time ) .
a reduced cle@@ aring of by cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 enzyme met@@ abolic systems is un@@ likely because z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed in humans and because it does not have a weak or not direct and / or ir@@ reversible , vibr@@ ating dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ -
special patient groups ( see Section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al cle@@ aring of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid cor@@ related with the cre@@ at@@ ine Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ ine Clear@@ ance , and amounted to 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this results in a slight decrease ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate ren@@ al function until reaching a cre@@ at@@ ine cle@@ aring up to 35 ml / min no dose adjustment of the c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid demands .
because for severe kidney dysfunction ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only restricted data is possible for this population no statements possible .
tox@@ icity The highest non @-@ acting intraven@@ ous dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight and rats 0,6 mg / kg body weight .
for studies in dogs , single doses have been 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C the 6@@ fold of the recommended human therapeutic exposition ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without an ren@@ al improvement .

SSE overweight patients and patients with o@@ bes@@ ity were studied , and in addition to 3800 patients in further indications .
the following table ( Table 1 ) shows the un@@ wanted effects of un@@ wanted effects in placebo @-@ controlled studies in patients who were treated to weight reduction and because of accompanying metabolism .
it was statistically significant higher than the corresponding plac@@ eb@@ or@@ ate ( for un@@ wanted effects ≥ 1 % ) or if they were clin@@ ically relevant ( for un@@ wanted effects &lt; 1 % ) . ng In the assessment of side effects , the following numbers are explained :

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public The present document is a summary of the European public assessment report ( EP@@ AR ) , in which explains how the Committee for Human @-@ Comp@@ ensation ( CH@@ MP ) has performed the conducted studies in order to access recommendations concerning the application of medication .
acet@@ ate is applied to treatment of type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) , where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabet@@ ic medicine ) can not be applied . • It can be applied together with another diabet@@ ic medicine ( Du@@ al@@ therapy ) .
in addition , met@@ form@@ in patients ( especially above important patients ) can be applied , which can &apos;t be satisfactory in the highest toler@@ able dose alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with a sulph@@ ur resin or insulin , the present dose of sulph@@ ur resin or insulin can be retained at the beginning of acet@@ ate treatment , except for patients with hypo@@ glyc@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should be reduced to the dose of sulph@@ ur resin or insulin .
this means that the body &apos;s own insulin is better , and the blood sugar level drops better , reducing type 2 diabetes .
in case of more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of acet@@ ate in Tri@@ ple@@ therapy was investigated ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sulph@@ ur resin , in addition they received either acet@@ tos or placebo for 3.5 years .
in the studies , the concentration of a substance was measured in the blood ( gly@@ cop@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) which shows how well the blood sugar is set .
in addition to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which means that blood gl@@ ucose levels has been lowered by 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the Tri@@ ple@@ therapy study the effect of an additional gift of acet@@ tos on the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sulph@@ ur resin in a decrease of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional gift from placebo led to a decrease of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study , in which the combination of acet@@ tos and insulin was examined in 289 patients , patients who took action in addition to insulin , lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.14 % compared to placebo which took additional placebo .
the most common adverse events associated with Ac@@ tos were vision disorders , infections of the upper respir@@ atory trac@@ ts ( cold ) , weight gain and hypo@@ thesis ( reduced sensitivity to maturity ) .
acet@@ tos must not be applied to patients either ( allergic ) against Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ ac@@ on or one of the other parts , even in patients with liver problems , con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure or diabet@@ ic C@@ eto@@ azi@@ r ( high hardness levels - acidity level - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that acet@@ tos should serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients , where met@@ form@@ in is not displayed in which met@@ form@@ in is not displayed .
in October 2000 the European Commission announced the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited approval for placing on account of account in the entire European Union .
the tablets are white and white , round , curved and carry on one side the mark &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS . &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ ac@@ on is also shown for the combination with insulin type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is in@@ adequate , and in which met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or in@@ compatibility ( see Section 4.4 ) .
for the use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ ac@@ on in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , therefore the application is not recommended in this age group .
in patients receiving at least one risk factor ( e.g. former heart attack or sy@@ mptom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose continuously .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure , weight gain or oil , especially those with reduced cardiovascular reserve .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure , weight gain and est@@ rogen occurs when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular study involving Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ ac@@ on in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease was carried out .
this study showed an increase in reports of cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency , which however did not lead to an increase of mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output liver data ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the norm range ) or with other signs of a liver disease may not be used to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
if the AL@@ T mirror increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the standardis@@ ation range , the liver data are as soon as possible to control .
if a patient is designed to refer to a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ clari@@ fied nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , tor@@ ess@@ ness , fatigue , appet@@ ite and / or dar@@ ker Har@@ n , are the liver data values to verify .
the decision to continue whether the treatment of patients with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one should be continued until the pre @-@ order of the laboratory parameters of clinical assessment .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ ac@@ on , a dos@@ gra@@ zing weight gain was detected , which can be used by grease deposits , and in some cases with a liquid range .
as a result of a hem@@ odi@@ l@@ ution performed under the treatment of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ ac@@ on a lower reduction in the middle hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction of 4.1 % ) .
similar changes were observed in comparative studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ ac@@ on in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ s by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % ) and the insulin ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ s by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients receiving pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ ac@@ on as oral branch or triple @-@ combination therapy with a sulph@@ ur resin or as a branch @-@ combination therapy with insulin , the risk of a dos@@ is@@ dependent hypo@@ glyc@@ emia .
following the market launch , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ ac@@ on , a deteri@@ oration of a diabet@@ ic mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a was reported , with a reduction of visual acuity .
it is un@@ clear if there is a direct connection between taking Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ ac@@ on and the occurr@@ ence of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ ons , but they should be aware of a mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a , if patients have to report on dis@@ rup@@ tions of visual acuity ; a complete ophthalm@@ ologic examination should be considered .
in a summary analysis of messages un@@ wanted events of un@@ desirable , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients who were treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ ac@@ on
the applied fra@@ cture @-@ incidence was 1.9 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years of treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ ac@@ on treated women and 1.1 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years of women who were treated with a comparative medication .
in the pro@@ active study , a study of 3,5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular disease reported fra@@ c@@ tures at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 fra@@ c@@ tures for 100 patient years ) compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients that were treated with a comparative medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient wishes or enter a pregnancy , the treatment is taken ( see Section 4.6 ) .
studies for exam@@ ining the inter@@ actions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ ac@@ on has no relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics or pharmaceutical dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , phenol , and met@@ form@@ in .
inter@@ actions with drugs which are met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed by these enzy@@ mes , such as oral contra@@ ction , Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A @-@ reduction inhibit@@ or are not expected .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ ac@@ on with gem@@ fibro@@ us ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8- inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase of the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ ac@@ on around the 3 times .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ ac@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a decrease of the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ ac@@ on by 54 % .
this is primarily attributable to treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one who reduces hyper@@ p@@ amp@@ in@@ emia and increased non @-@ resistant insulin @-@ resistant insulin @-@ resistant increase in the loss of met@@ abolic substr@@ ates .

they lead to a temporary change in the Tur@@ g@@ ors and the refra@@ ctive index of the lens , as they can also be observed in other hypo@@ glyc@@ em@@ ic effects .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ ac@@ on , AL@@ T @-@ infection about three times the upper limit of the norm range is similar to as below placebo but less than in comparative groups below met@@ form@@ in or sulph@@ ate resin .
in an Out@@ come study in patients with pre @-@ existing mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease , the frequency of a severe cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency was 1.6 % higher than placebo when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ ac@@ on bz@@ w .
since the market launch , rarely about cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency was reported in Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ ac@@ on , however , when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ ac@@ on was used in combination with insulin @-@ failure in patients with con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure .
there was a summary analysis of messages un@@ wanted events of randomised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ ac@@ on @-@ treated groups and more than 7.@@ 400 patients treated with comparative medication @-@ treated groups .
during a period of 3.5 years of ongoing pro@@ active study , fra@@ c@@ tures were treated with 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ ac@@ on patients , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients that were treated with a comparison medication .
in taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , 180 mg / day after seven days there were no symptoms .
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one seems to work with activ@@ ating specific core receptor ( per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome pro@@ lifer@@ ator of re@@ pt@@ or @-@ γ ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) ) , which leads to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver , grease and sk@@ el@@ eton mus@@ cular cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ ac@@ on reduces the Glu@@ cos@@ ine production in the liver and increases the peripheral Glu@@ cos@@ ystem use in the case of insulin resistant .
a clinical study involving Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ ac@@ on versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de as Mon@@ otherapy has continued over two years to investigate the time until the time of the therapeutic effectiveness ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
at the time after two years after the onset of therapy , a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) could be calculated by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ ac@@ on at 69 % of treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was discontinued despite three im@@ on@@ ati@@ bility optim@@ isation , to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo .
in patients under pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ ac@@ on , the mean h@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c - value was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to patients who still only received insulin ; a reduction in the insulin @-@ insulin @-@ treated group was observed .
in clinical trials over a year , under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ ac@@ on introduced a statistically significant decline in the album / cre@@ at@@ ine quot@@ i@@ ents compared to the initial values .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ ac@@ on ( Mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small scale based on type 2 diabet@@ ics .
in most clinical studies , compared to placebo a reduction of the overall plasma tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as slightly , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased LD@@ L@@ - Chol@@ ester@@ in@@ spiegel .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ ac@@ on compared to Pl@@ az@@ ebo , Met@@ form@@ in or Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de the total pl@@ as@@ ol gly@@ cop@@ ic acid and free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol level .
in comparison to Pl@@ az@@ ebo was no statistically significant increase in LD@@ L cholesterol levels while in met@@ form@@ in and Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d decreased values .
in a study more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ ac@@ on reduced tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ de , but also improved tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ de level , which has an effect on tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as to the h@@ ep@@ atic Tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ de synthesis .
in the pro@@ active study , a cardi@@ ac study Out@@ come study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease were random@@ ized to have a time of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing anti@@ diabet@@ ic and cardiovascular disease either to the existing anti@@ diabet@@ ic and cardiovascular disease .
after oral application , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ ac@@ on is absorbed quickly , with the top concentration of dum@@ pl@@ it@@ ac@@ on in plasma usually 2 hours after application .
this basis corresponds to the contribution of M @-@ IV to efficacy in about three times the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ ac@@ on , while the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II minim@@ ally pronounced .
in Inter@@ action studies , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ ac@@ on has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics or pharmaceutical dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , phenol , and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ ac@@ on ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases the plasma concentration of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ ac@@ on ( see section 4.5 ) .
after oral application of radioactive mark@@ eted Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ ac@@ on in humans , the mark@@ er was found mainly in the fever ( 55 % ) and a lower extent in the har@@ ness ( 45 % ) .
the mean plasma @-@ elim@@ ination up@@ time of un@@ changeable Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ ac@@ on is 5 @-@ 6 hours , while the total active metabolism is in 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma concentration of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ ac@@ on and its metabolism are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than with healthy volunteers , but the rates of the oral cle@@ aring of the parent is similar .
in tox@@ ic@@ ological studies appeared in mice , rats , dogs and apes , after repeated administration , with hem@@ odi@@ l@@ ution , an@@ emia and reversible ec@@ cent@@ ric cardi@@ ac hyper@@ t@@ rophy .
this is primarily attributable to treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ ac@@ on which reduces hyper@@ p@@ ine@@ in@@ emia and increased non @-@ resistant insulin @-@ resistance of dam@@ s and reduces the availability of met@@ abolic substr@@ ates for the red@@ dish growth .
in long term studies ( up to 2 years ) , hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( in male and female rats ) were in@@ induced by male and female rats ( male and female rats ) .
in a veter@@ inary model of the family @-@ family poly@@ pos@@ is ( FA@@ P ) , treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ oli@@ ons lead to an increased frequency of colonies .
the tablets are white @-@ wh@@ it@@ ish , round , flat and wear on one side the mark &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS . &quot;
the applied fra@@ cture @-@ incidence was 1.9 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years of treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ ac@@ on treated women and 1.1 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years of women who were treated with a comparative medication .
in the pro@@ active study , a study of 3,5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular disease reported fra@@ c@@ tures at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 fra@@ c@@ tures for 100 patient years ) compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients that were treated with a comparative medication .
in another study about two years the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in , each with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ ac@@ on or Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d were examined .
in clinical trials over 1 year , under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ ac@@ on demonstrated a statistically significant decline in the album / cre@@ at@@ ine quot@@ i@@ ents compared to the initial values .
in a study more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ de level , but improved tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ de level , which has an effect on the Tr@@ y@@ glyc@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as to the h@@ ep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ g@@ liz@@ d synthesis .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was unable to produce in total 294 patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the pan@@ cre@@ as can produce no insulin , and type 2 diabetes , in which the body is not capable of use insulin .
in the study , after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cop@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which shows how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c spi@@ der that indicates that blood sugar levels have been lowered considerably , like with another human insulin .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be applied to patients that react over@@ sensitive to human insulin ( DNA ) or one of the other parts .
in addition , doses have to be adjusted by Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane , when it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can effect on the blood sugar ( the full list is to be found in the pack@@ ag@@ ation ) .
the Medic@@ ines Committee ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was overweight in the treatment of diabetes in the treatment of diabetes .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for placing the placing on the market of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane throughout the European Union .

patients whose blood gl@@ ucose level increases significantly by an intensi@@ fied insulin therapy , the hypo@@ glyc@@ emia warning sympt@@ om can have changed , and should be advised accordingly .
any change in strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast wir@@ ling , bi@@ phas@@ ic , long@@ acting insulin , etc . ) , art of insulin , anti @-@ insulin ( insulin ) and / or manufacturing method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNS for insulin @-@ animal origin ) can result in a change of dosage .
in case of changing to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane during the patient a dose adjustment is necessary , it may be necessary in the first dosage or during the first weeks or months after the change@@ over .
some patients receiving hypo@@ glyc@@ em@@ ic reactions after a change of animal on human insulin reported that the early warning sympt@@ om of a hypo@@ glyc@@ emia were less pronounced than in their previous insulin .
before travel , which go over several time zones , the patient should be pointed out to get the advice of his physician , as such vo@@ y@@ ages can be applied , or should be taken or taken in other times .
therefore , the doctor must be taken into account with regard to therapy and to investigate his patients always with other medicines prescribed by them .

a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can however develop gradually : • Easy hypo@@ glyc@@ emia can be treated by the oral supply of gl@@ ucose or sugar food .
diabet@@ ics should therefore always have sad@@ ness , swe@@ ets , bis@@ cu@@ its , or sugar fruit juice . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ glyc@@ em@@ esis will be treated with in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of gl@@ uc@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) or given by a proven auxiliary drive or given by gl@@ ucose which is given intraven@@ ously through the doctor .
the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum maximum will be reached within 2 to 8 hours and the entire duration is up to 24 hours .

in addition , the cans of Ac@@ cel@@ pi@@ d may be adapted if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for placing the placing on the market of Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d throughout the European Union .
if two types of insulin are mixed , first the amount of the rapidly acting insulin must first be removed , then the amount of a long @-@ acting insulin .

Aden@@ ur@@ ic will be used in patients , including arthritis ( pain and inflamm@@ ation in the joints ) or po@@ ison@@ ous notes ( &quot; stones &quot; ) , which can lead larger ur@@ ine cryst@@ all@@ ings , which can lead to gel and bone damage .
if the ur@@ inary flavor is increased after two to four weeks , even more than 6 mg per de@@ il@@ iter , the dose may be increased to 120 mg once daily .
during the first treatment months you can still occur gi@@ cht@@ ing cases ; therefore we recommend that patients should be taken at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic nor further medicines for prevention of tox@@ icity .
the medicine is not recommended in children and patients who had an organ transplan@@ tation , as it was not examined for these groups .
in the first study , at which 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , the efficacy of three Aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared to placebo ( a placebo ) and from Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medic@@ inal product to the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second study two dos@@ ages of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was applied in a dose of 300 mg once daily ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main Indi@@ c@@ ator for the effectiveness was the number of patients whose ur@@ inary flavor was in the blood of the last three measurements under 6 mg / dl .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 from 262 ) of patients , the Aden@@ ur@@ ic at a dose of once daily 80 mg of the patients , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of patients who were once daily 120 mg of the patients , with the last three measurements obtained a ure@@ benefit mirror in the blood of under 6 mg / dl .
in comparison , this was the case with 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in none of the 134 patients under placebo .
the most common adverse events of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ ache , di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , nau@@ sea ( Nau@@ sea ) , r@@ ash and abnormal liver values .
especially in patients with heart failure in the pre@@ history , possibly an increased risk of certain side effects , which affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee on Human Nutrition ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in the blood of acid in the blood more effective than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects in connection with the heart and blood vessels .

if the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ aci@@ dic mirror is still 2 @-@ 4 weeks still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mol / l ) , a dose increase can be considered on AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily .
patients with severe kidney @-@ function restriction were not fully examined ( Kre@@ at@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) .
children and adolescents since there is no experience in children and adolescents , the application of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this group of patients .
organ transplan@@ tation Da there is no experience in organ transplan@@ ts , the application of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this group of patients ( see Section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular diseases In patients with isch@@ a@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ composition con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure is not recommended ( see section 4.8 ) .
as with other har@@ n@@ aci@@ dic drugs , it may occur during the treatment of a acute tox@@ icity , because by the lowering of the ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ acid spi@@ der@@ ings first in the tissue can be mobil@@ ised in the tissue .

liver disease During the clinical studies of phase 3 , the metast@@ ases of the liver function were observed with re@@ por@@ ate patients ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver functional test before the beginning of February ( see Section 5.1 ) .
The@@ oph@@ yl@@ line Z@@ was no alter@@ ation studies to Feb@@ r@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O inhibit@@ ing can lead to an increase in the The@@ oph@@ yl@@ lin@@ spi@@ racy ( a in@@ hibition of the metabolism of The@@ oph@@ yl@@ line has also been reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
the test was associated with the simultaneous administration of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at and Nap@@ ro@@ xen 250 mg 2 times daily with an increase in Feb@@ u@@ per@@ ate exposition ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical trials , the application of Nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ or were not in connection with a clinical significant increase of adverse events .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in , without having a dose adjustment for Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ or or the other active ingredient required at the same time .
in a study involving human subjects , 120 mg of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily has a mean 22 % increase in AU@@ D of Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 substr@@ ate , which indicates a possible @-@ weak ec@@ or@@ ic effect of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at to the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ enzyme in vivo .
Ant@@ azi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous taking of a ant@@ acids that contains magnesium hydro@@ x@@ ide and aluminum hydro@@ x@@ ide , the absorption of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and a decrease in the C@@ max by 32 % , however , does not have any significant change in AU@@ D .
pregnancy data over a very limited number of exp@@ on@@ ated pregn@@ an@@ cies don &apos;t leave any adverse events of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ ost@@ at to the pregnancy or health of the fet@@ us / new@@ bor@@ ns .
animal experimental studies do not leave direct or indirect adverse impacts on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) .
patients should be careful with the taxes of a vehicle that serve out of machines or the exercise of dangerous activities , until they reas@@ on@@ ably be sure that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC influences their performance .

di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients who were treated simultaneously with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical trials were observed no serious skin attacks or severe survival transactions .
7 Open @-@ term renewal studies In open @-@ term renewal studies were treated 906 patients up to 1 year , 322 patients for up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years long and 53 patients up to 4 years with Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ ate 80 mg / 120 mg .
during the long @-@ term - renewal studies , treated events were similar to them that were reported in phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
the subsequent treatment @-@ related events were reported in all Feb@@ u@@ ux@@ e@@ at@@ - treatment groups over once and reported in patients who received February 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term renewal studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 years of age ) , according to information on occasionally .

the reduction of the car@@ rot @-@ acid spi@@ der to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mol / l ) was observed during the physician attendance at week 2 and permanently maintained for the entire treatment .
509 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ en@@ cir@@ at@@ ine values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub @-@ group of patients with kidney @-@ function restriction The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with kidney @-@ function restriction ( d. h ) .
AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was the primary activity of the primary activity of 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences regarding the percentage of the serum acid concentrations in subjects , regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in group with normal kidney function and 55 % in group with severe kidney dysfunction ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl About 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ act study ) had to study a serum acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
the data collected in two years of the open extension study of phase 3 showed that less than 3 % of patients have required a decrease in the incidence of tox@@ icity ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients required for a non @-@ shift ) .
this was associated with a reduction in gyp@@ sum particle size which had 54 % of the patients a complete dis@@ appearance of po@@ etic banknotes until month 24 .
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with February ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients receiving Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in the open @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
in healthy volunteers the maximum plasma concentration camps ( C@@ max ) and the area under the plasma concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C ) of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at increased after administration easier and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg is observed for Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ ost@@ at an increase of AU@@ D , which is larger than the dos@@ si@@ proportional increase .
after taking a simple or multifunctional doses of 80 to 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ max is about 2.8 @-@ 3,2 µg / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µg / ml .
however , no clinical significant change in the percentage of the serum acid concentration was observed , if this was checked ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent ste@@ ady state @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ s@@ s / F ) of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at is in the range from 29 to 75 l after intake of doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the Plas@@ m@@ ap@@ rot@@ ein cord of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ ost@@ at is about 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary binder on alb@@ um@@ in ) and is about the concentr@@ ating width which is achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vitro studies in human liver mic@@ ros@@ omes demonstrated that these oxid@@ ative metabolism are formed mainly due to CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 or CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 9 , and that Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id is mainly created by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C mark@@ ised Feb@@ u@@ at , about 49 % of the dose in the ur@@ ine was found in the un@@ changeable stal@@ ux@@ e@@ ate ( 3 % ) , acet@@ yl@@ glu@@ co@@ id of the drug ( 30 % ) , whose known oxid@@ ative metabolism and its con@@ jug@@ ate ( 13 % ) and other un@@ known met@@ abolic ( 3 % ) again .
in addition to the exclusion of the ur@@ ine , approximately 45 % of the dose in the chair is also un@@ changeable ( 1 % ) , acet@@ yl@@ glu@@ ed in the drug ( 1 % ) , whose known oxid@@ ative metabolism and its con@@ jug@@ ate ( 25 % ) as well as other un@@ known met@@ abolic ( 7 % ) .
special patient groups cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe ren@@ al failure , the C@@ max of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ aster was not changed in relation to subjects with normal kidney function .
the average total @-@ AU@@ C of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at increased by about 1.8 @-@ times from 7.5 to g / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13,@@ 2 μ g / ml in the group with severe kidney cleanse function .

age There were no significant changes in regard to the AU@@ C of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ ost@@ at or its metabol@@ ites after taking multi@@ pler doses of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in older patients compared to younger subjects .
car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ esis , Mut@@ agen@@ esis , impair@@ ment of fertil@@ ity In male rats became a statistically significant increase in ur@@ inary bladder ( transitional cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ oma ) only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin @-@ stones in the highly @-@ treated group , with approximately 11 times the exposure of human exposure .
these findings are seen as a result of a specified @-@ specific pur@@ ification and ur@@ ine composition , and not relevant for clinical use .
it has been noted that Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on fertil@@ ity and re@@ productive capacity of male and female rats .
in high doses , which were about 4 x 3 of the human therapeutic exposure , the matern@@ al tox@@ icity occurred , which entered with a reduction in lowering performance and a development delay in the offspring of rats .
ter@@ at@@ ological studies in supporting rats with ex@@ positions , which were about 4.3 @-@ times and when carrying out @-@ rab@@ bit with ex@@ positions , which was about 13 times the human therapeutic exposure , did not exceed the beneficial effects .

the patient must be the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking , or intake of other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vit@@ amine supplem@@ entary equipment ) .
in order to avoid a irrit@@ ation of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient must not lie down after the first food intake of the day , no less than 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and Vitamin D3 is already used separately in pharmac@@ euticals , which are approved in the European Union , the company submitted data from previous studies and published literature .
the company also led a study with 35 men and 6@@ 82 post @-@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis in order to improve the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE regarding the increase of vitamin D levels .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D mirrors were treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 11 % ) than for those who only receive al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate revenues ( 32 % ) .
the company also put data before , which indicates that in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at dosage is exactly the dose which is needed for preventing a bone loss .
the most common adverse events ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ ache , pain or joints and symptoms of the digest@@ ive system such as abdom@@ inal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ e ( di@@ arr@@ he@@ a ) , const@@ ip@@ ation ( epi@@ thel@@ m ) of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , dy@@ nasty ( stro@@ kes ) , t@@ ooth@@ ed abdom@@ en ( puff@@ ed abdom@@ en ) , t@@ ooth@@ ed abdom@@ en ( puff@@ ed abdom@@ en ) as well as acid digest@@ ion .
in patients with genetic over@@ sensitivity ( allerg@@ y ) against al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D3 or one of other parts can &apos;t be applied AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
it may not be applied in diseases of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus ( low calcium level ) or in patients who are not upright or sit in at least 30 minutes .

capsule @-@ shaped , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; 710 &quot; on the other side .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or use of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vit@@ amine supplem@@ entary food ) for the day .
the following remarks are accurate to reduce the risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant irrit@@ ation and related side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is supposed to be swal@@ lowed with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) , as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al Ul@@ zer@@ a . • The patients should not be taken before the first food intake of the day that should take place earliest after 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B. p@@ amp@@ er Ul@@ kus , active gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal ble@@ eding or surgical inter@@ ventions in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal tract except P@@ yl@@ or@@ oplast@@ ic , only with particular attention ( see section 4.3 ) .
eco @-@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ itis , ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ id , rarely followed by mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stri@@ ves , were reported in patients under the taking of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( partly these severe and required a n@@ aval instruction ) .
the doctor may therefore atten@@ tively refer to all signs and symptoms who are supposed to refer to possible mal@@ ign@@ ant reactions , and the patients are to be noted when the symptoms of symptoms or retro@@ actively p@@ ains pain or new or intensi@@ fied So@@ d@@ burn the medicine or to obtain medical advice ( see section 4.8 ) .
3 The risk of severe bi@@ op@@ ic effects seem to be increased in patients that would not receive the medicine properly and / or after the occurr@@ ence of symptoms , who refer to an ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al Ir@@ rit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosage instructions are transferred to the patient and understood from the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .
while in large @-@ scale trials with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate no increased risk was detected , rarely ( after market launch ) stomach and du@@ oden@@ al@@ ul@@ cer@@ a were reported , including some severe serious and complications . ( see section 4.8 ) .
oste@@ op@@ ec@@ rose of the upper jaw , usually in connection with a tooth traction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ opath@@ itis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose therapy consisted predominantly IV .
there are no data available to specify if the deriv@@ ative of a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ at@@ therapy in patients who need a sl@@ ate surgical procedure , reducing the risk of oste@@ op@@ ec@@ rose of the upper jaw .
the clinical assessment by the treat doctor is decisive for the treatment planning in each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the patients should be noted that in case of taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE the tablet is supposed to take the tablet on the next morning after taking their sow .
they are supposed to take no two tablets the same day , but taking taking one tablet a week as originally planned for the week of the week .
other diseases caused by the mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D defic@@ iency and Hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) , should also be treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE prior to the start of therapy .
Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate food and beverage ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some or@@ ale medicines can affect the res@@ or@@ ption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate when they are taken at the same time .
therefore patients must wait for at least 30 minutes after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at for at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific intervention studies have not been carried out , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken together in clinical trials with a variety of ordinary medicines that clin@@ ically inter@@ viewed with clinical inter@@ actions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for use with post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore neither used during pregnancy nor effective women .
animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate leave no reference to the damage caused by pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ op@@ ec@@ rose of the upper jaw was reported in patients under bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most of the reports are from cancer patients , but also reported in oste@@ op@@ or@@ os@@ ep@@ ati@@ cian .
nevertheless , the serum @-@ cal@@ ci@@ um decreased to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl ( 2,0 m@@ mol / l ) and the serum and phosph@@ ats up to ≤ 2,0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mol / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency .

studies of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate The therapeutic equality of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at once weekly 70 mg ( n = 519 ) and Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 10 mg daily ( n = 370 ) was detected in a single @-@ year multi @-@ core study on post @-@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis .
the effects of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and fra@@ cture incidence at post @-@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women were studied in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in the fra@@ cture study ( F@@ IT : N = 6.@@ 459 ) .
in the phase III studies , the mean asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 10 mg / day in relation to Pl@@ az@@ ebo after 3 years 8.8 % at the sp@@ ine , 5.9 % at the Fem@@ ur@@ h@@ als and 7.8 % at the tro@@ chan@@ ter .
in the group treated with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at group , a 48 % reduction ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 3.2 % ) was achieved compared to placebo ( 6.2 % ) for the proportion of people who suffered one or several verteb@@ ra@@ c@@ tures .
in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D continued from the sp@@ ine and Tro@@ uble ; the BM@@ D of the Fem@@ ur@@ hal@@ ves and the entire body has been calculated .
further information consisted of two places @-@ controlled trials , in which Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate daily ( 5 mg daily over 2 years and then 10 mg daily may be taken either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study the daily gift of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at reduced the occurr@@ ence of at least one new verteb@@ rates by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.9 % compared to placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
res@@ or@@ ption related to an intraven@@ ous reference dose was the mean or@@ ale bi@@ al availability of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate at women 0,@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after n@@ urs@@ ing fast@@ ing and two hours before recording of a standardized breakfast .
the bio availability increased accordingly to approximately 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken one or half an hour before standardized breakfast .
in oste@@ op@@ or@@ os@@ est@@ udi@@ en , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drinking of the day .
in healthy volunteers the administration of orange pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily over five days ) resulted in no clin@@ ically significant alter@@ ation of the oral bio availability of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 distribution studies in rats revealed that Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is temporarily distributed to intraven@@ ous gift of 1 mg / kg temporarily , but then distributed rapidly into the bones or di@@ vor@@ ced by the ur@@ ine .
out of an intraven@@ ous gift of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , about 50 % of the radioactive substance were ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with the ur@@ ine , and no radio@@ activity was found in the f@@ ences .
according to the intraven@@ ous gift of a single dose of 10 mg the ren@@ al cle@@ ance of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was 71 ml / min and the system@@ ic cle@@ aring was not exceeding 200 ml / min .
Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in rats to the aci@@ dic or basic transport system of the kidneys , and therefore it is not assumed that people influences the expansion of other medicines by these transport systems .
res@@ or@@ ption In healthy adult subjects ( women and men ) was after the gift of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE according to the gift of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE according to the serum concentration time ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 120 h ) for vitamin D3 29@@ 6.4 ng / h / ml ( without consideration endo@@ thel@@ ial vitamin D3 mirror ) .
mean maximum concentration in serum ( C@@ max ) of vitamin D3 was 5.9 ng / ml and the median time to reach the maximum serum concentration ( T@@ max ) 12 hours .
biot@@ rans@@ om Vitamin D3 is rapidly ulated in the liver rapidly to 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ vitamin D3 hydro@@ xy@@ lic and then in the kidney to 1.25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ lic D3 , the biolog@@ ically active form , met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed .
the precip@@ itation of radioactive mark@@ edly vitamin D3 in healthy subjects was 2.4 % of the radio@@ activity in the ur@@ ine after 48 hours of 2.4 % , in the cases after 4 days 4.9 % .
characteristics of patients with clinical studies showed that the proportion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not moved out in the bones , will soon be eliminated .
although no clinical data lie above , nonetheless , the ren@@ al elim@@ ination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in the animal try also reduced in patients with reduced kidney function .
therefore in patients with reduced kidney function , a slightly increased cum@@ ulation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is expected in the bones ( see section 4.2 ) .

Adv@@ oc@@ f is administered to adult patients , to whom a kidneys or liver tran@@ spl@@ ant has been transplan@@ ted to prevent tran@@ sc@@ oring of transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft has already been used in the EU , the company has presented the results from the previous studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from the published literature .
furthermore , the results of a clinical study presented to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation , whereby the application was compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main Indi@@ c@@ ator of the efficacy was the number of patients with which the transplan@@ tation was interrupted after a period of therapy ( for example , looking for example a renewed organ transplan@@ tation or a resum@@ ption of the di@@ aly@@ sis needed ) .
Moreover , recent studies have been carried out in 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver tran@@ spl@@ ant and examined how adv@@ agra@@ f is absorbed by the body as compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of tran@@ spl@@ ant patients , this medicine should be classified , or make changes in the immune @-@ intensive therapy .
because of clin@@ ically relevant differences of the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us this can lead to gra@@ ft reactions or to an increased incidence of adverse events , including under@@ - or immune response .
patients always maintained the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; revers@@ ing of the formulation or reg@@ imes should only be performed under the nar@@ row@@ ful control of a medical profession ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
as a result of a change@@ over to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic pharmaceutical monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments will be performed to ensure that the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains .
the dosage of Adv@@ agra@@ f should be primarily based on clinical assessment of waste and toler@@ ability in individual fall and on blood @-@ reflective specifications ( see below &quot; recommendations
after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ oc@@ f the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley should be monitored in front of the change@@ over and over two weeks of change@@ over .
on Day 4 , the system@@ ic exposure time was measured as a valley level with both for@@ b@@ ons both with kidney and transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley level are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , in order to ensure adequate substance exposure in immediate recovery phase .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low cle@@ aring can take a change of the Adv@@ oc@@ f @-@ Dos@@ is@@ schem@@ as several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached .
if the patient is not allowed to use drugs in the first postoperative phase , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment can be intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of infusion solution ) , with a dose of ca .
the application for the suppression of the transplan@@ tation must be avoided ; therefore , a maximum duration of oral therapy can be un@@ specified .
dose recommendations - kidney transplan@@ tation for transplan@@ tation , the oral Adv@@ ant@@ ine therapy should begin with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift at the morning .
further dose adjustments can be later necessary since the pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the process of stabil@@ ization of patients after transplan@@ tation .
dose recommendations - liver tran@@ spl@@ ant proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of transplan@@ tation . oral Adv@@ ant@@ ine therapy should begin with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift at the morning .
recommended Dos@@ age - change@@ over from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ oc@@ f must be converted to a daily dosage of pro@@ gra@@ f capsules at a time daily intake of Adv@@ agra@@ f , this change@@ over is taken at a ratio of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , relative to the entire daily dose .
kidney and liver tran@@ spl@@ ant after a change@@ over from other immun@@ os@@ res@@ si@@ va to Adv@@ oc@@ f once a day the treatment with the recommended initi@@ als recommended dose for the proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of transplan@@ tation begin .
transplan@@ tation in adult patients who are converted to Adv@@ oc@@ f is an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg per day once daily .
other tran@@ spl@@ ant receivers Ob@@ do not have clinical experience with Adv@@ ant@@ age in lung cancer , pan@@ cre@@ as and dar@@ m@@ transplan@@ ted patients in a oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day , with pan@@ cre@@ denti@@ fied patients at a oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day and for intest@@ inal transplan@@ ts in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dose adjustment in special patient groups with reduced liver function for maintaining blood @-@ tal@@ es in the targeted sphere can be necessary in patients with heavy liver function and a reduction of the dose .
patients with reduced kidney function When kidney function does not exercise impact on pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it may be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potenti@@ als of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us a careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of the ser@@ en@@ cir@@ at@@ ine mirror , a calculation of cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine and monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .
change@@ over from Cic@@ los@@ age to Adv@@ oc@@ f At the change@@ over of a Cic@@ los@@ por@@ ine - to a Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is caution ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on the valley level in full blood The dose should be primarily associated with clinical assessment of exhaust and toler@@ ability in single fall under in@@ ability of full blood @-@ blood @-@ blood @-@ level controls .
it is recommended to perform frequent controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley level during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic inspec@@ tions during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ valley mirror of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be controlled by Pro@@ gra@@ f at Adv@@ ant@@ f , Dos@@ age custom@@ ization , modifications of immune soup @-@ intensive therapy or with continuous use of substances that could change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us whole blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ ant@@ f is a drug with a low cle@@ aring , custom@@ ization of the dose may require several days until the Ste@@ ady State entered .
the data in clinical trials make sure that a successful treatment is possible in most cases when the valley mirror should not exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the valley level of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us are in full blood in the first time according to liver tran@@ spl@@ ant usually in the range from 5 - 20 ng / ml and wor@@ ried patients with 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent re@@ tention of liver , kidney and pal@@ ms , blood concentrations in the range from 5 - 15 ng / ml were generally used .
this has led to serious adverse events including gra@@ ft reactions or other side effects , which can occur in a row of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us sub@@ - or over@@ exposition .
patients always maintained the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; revers@@ ing of the formulation or reg@@ imes should only be performed under the nar@@ row@@ ful control of a medical profession ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft reactions , which att@@ aching to other immun@@ os@@ res@@ si@@ va as therapy , no clinical data for the ret@@ ardi@@ zed formulation of Adv@@ agra@@ f .
to the proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of the gra@@ ft reactions in adult heart tran@@ spl@@ ant and gra@@ ft reactions in childhood are no clinical data for the ret@@ ardi@@ zed formulation of Adv@@ agra@@ f .
due to potential interaction , which can lead to a reduction of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us mirror in the blood and a fe@@ asi@@ bility of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , is the intake of Herbal medicine , the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ation ) , or avoid other plant healing during treatment with adv@@ ancing ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients with di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea is a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us concentrations in the blood , as the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood level could be subjected to such circumstances .
in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f , considered a cardi@@ ac opath@@ y called Kammer@@ - or sept@@ um@@ hyper@@ t@@ roph@@ ie , which can therefore occur below the agra@@ f .
other factors which increase the risk of such clinical distur@@ ban@@ ces are already existing cardi@@ ac disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ero@@ ids , kidney or liver function , infections , fluid load and oil .
as with other immun@@ os@@ res@@ si@@ va , the impact of sunlight or UV light should be restricted by suitable clothing or using a sun protection by means of a high protective factor .
if patients receiving tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms of po@@ res like head@@ ache , changed awareness of consciousness , alter@@ nat@@ ors and vision disorders , should be a radical investigation ( e.@@ g .
since Adv@@ anc@@ f hard capsules , ret@@ ann@@ ess , l@@ act@@ ose is included in patients with the rare l@@ act@@ ose @-@ l@@ act@@ ose int@@ ol@@ er@@ ance , l@@ act@@ ase defic@@ iency , or gl@@ ucose @-@ g@@ act@@ ose body absorption .
the simultaneous use of medicines or plant medic@@ ations that are known as inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors from CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can increase metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and thus reducing the blood values from Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
therefore , it is advis@@ able to change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - blood level when changing substances that can change the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain the smooth concentrations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .

pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics studies revealed that the increase of the blood level mainly from the increased bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , caused by the in@@ hibition of the gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal prop@@ iti@@ ation , results .
high @-@ level pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as it is used in acute exhaust actions , can increase the concentration of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood .
effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us to the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore the simultaneous application of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , whose metabolism will affect the metabolism .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us put down the cle@@ aring of ster@@ oid contra@@ ction and thereby the hormon@@ es can increase , it is particularly careful in the decisions of receiving measures .
the results of animal experiments have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can reduce the cle@@ aring of Pent@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital and phenol , and extend their half hours .
the results of a low number of investigations to tran@@ spl@@ ant patients do not provide evidence that under Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us a increased risk for un@@ wanted events in regard to the course and the result of pregnancy .
in u@@ ter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of new@@ bor@@ ns is recommended to potential adverse effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( especially with his effect on the kidneys ) .

Adv@@ ance is used to treat and prevention of ble@@ eding in patients with ha@@ em@@ oph@@ ilia A ( one by the lack of factor VIII , con@@ genital blood circulation ) .
dosage and frequency of application be applied to whether Adv@@ ance to the treatment of ble@@ eding or prevention of ble@@ eding in surgical intervention is applied .
patients with ha@@ em@@ oph@@ ilia A suffer from a factor VIII defic@@ iency , causing blood disorders such as ble@@ eding in joints , muscles or inner organisms .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but is based on a method using &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA &quot; technology :
it is produced by one cell where a gene was brought into a gene ( DNA ) that enabled it to formation of the human being of the human being .
the medicine approved in another in the European Union ( Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate ) , but is similar , but it does not contain proteins of proteins or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe mild to moderate hem@@ oph@@ ilia A , among them one study with 53 children under six years , the application of the medicine was examined by preventing ble@@ eding and surgical intervention .
in the main study , the efficacy of Adv@@ oc@@ ate in the prevention of ble@@ eding in 86 % of 510 new ble@@ eding associated with &quot; excellent &quot; respectively has been rated &quot; well . &quot;
the most common adverse events of advanced ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ ache , py@@ rex@@ ie ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies compared to factor VIII .
Adv@@ oc@@ ities may not be applied in patients , possibly with allergic ( allergic ) against the human Ger@@ ot@@ ation factor VIII , Maus@@ er or Ham@@ ster@@ protein or one of the other components .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted B@@ ax@@ ter AG to grant approval for placing on the market of the European Union .
dosage and duration of subst@@ itution , according to the sever@@ ity of factor VIII , after the place and the extent of ble@@ eding and clinical state of patients .
in the case of the equivalent rh@@ ag@@ ic events , factor VIII of the activity should not fall below the given plasma factors ( in % of the norm or in i.e. i.e. , i.e. , i.e. , i.e. , i.e. , in i.e. , i.e. , i.e. , in i.e. , i.e. , i.e. , in i.e. , i.e. , i.e. , in i.e. , i.e. , i.e. , in i.e. , i.e. , i.e. , in i.e. , i.e. , i.e. , in i.e. , i.e. , i.e. , in i.e. , i.e. , i.e. , in i.e. , i.e. , i.e. , in i.e. , i.e. , i.e. , in i.e. , i.e. , i.e. ,

injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours for patients under 6 years ) repeat until the risk of the patient is over .
during treatment , the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections will be a reasonable determination of factor VIII plasma factors .
individual patients can distinguish themselves in their response to factor VIII , varying in vivo recovery and have different half @-@ effects .
3 proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis For long @-@ term proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of ble@@ eding in patients with severe ha@@ em@@ oph@@ ilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 i.e. factor VIII per kilogram of body weight within 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor of VIII would not be achieved or if the blood is not ruled with a reasonable dose , a test must be performed if necessary for an inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic measures will need to be avoided .
the administration speed should be addressed to patients , with maximum inj@@ ection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alis@@ ing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with ha@@ em@@ oph@@ ilia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII to Ig@@ G Immun@@ og@@ lob@@ bies , which are qu@@ anti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml Plasma using modified Beth@@ es@@ da Ass@@ ay .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors , cor@@ related with the extent of exposure to factor VIII , whereby the risk of the first 20 expos@@ ures are on the largest and of genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 ex@@ positions and an@@ am@@ ne@@ stically known inhibit@@ or development , after conversion from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , re @-@ occur by ( lowest tit@@ ors ) inhibit@@ ors .
because of the rare onset of the hem@@ oph@@ ilia A in women there are no experiences about the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and breast@@ feeding .
the number of patients suffering from patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) who have explo@@ red an increased risk for formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .

based on the specifications available since the initial approval of the CH@@ MP , the CH@@ MP has continued to be positi@@ vely rated as a positive , but considering that the safety profile is closely monitored in the following reasons :
therefore , the CH@@ MP based on the basis of the security code from A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E , which makes a submission of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , decided to apply a further extension procedure for 5 years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited ( CH@@ MP ) shared the company that the company has its application for approval for the placing on the market for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
however , normally the breast , the brain , bones , or Wei@@ rd parts ( tissue , which combines other structures in the body , is surrounded and leans ) of it .
this is a kind of virus , which was genet@@ ically modified that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
with the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in , this is a &quot; Aden@@ ov@@ irus &quot; which is so altered that there is no copies of itself , and so that no infections could be redeemed in humans .
Adv@@ ex@@ in could be inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ours and enable the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein again .
the p@@ 53 @-@ protein that is made out of the human body existing p@@ 53 gene , usually carries damaged DNA and to kill cells in when the DNA can &apos;t be recovered .
in case of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , the p@@ 53 gene is def@@ ective , the p@@ 53 protein is not correct , and the cancer cells can grow and share it .
the company presented data from a study in a study involving the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the field of under@@ mining , in the bones and brain .
after the CH@@ MP grants the company &apos;s answers to the questions , still some questions were un@@ explained .
based on the testing of the initially submitted documents the CH@@ MP is created on Day 120 a list of questions that will be sent to the company .
according to the CH@@ MP diagram , the injection of adv@@ ances in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ tum@@ ors has been advantages for patients .
the committee further concerns relating to the processing of medication in the body , the type of administration as well as the safety of pharmac@@ euticals .
in addition , the company had not been demonstrated that adv@@ ances in this reliable way , and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in contact with the patient , is harmful .
the company translated the CH@@ MP not of it if the withdrawal consequences for patients who currently participate in clinical trials , or &quot; Comp@@ assi@@ on@@ ate @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; modified action &quot; means that the tablets are assembled so that one of the effective components are immediately released and the other slowly over a few hours .
Aer@@ in@@ aze is used to treat symptoms of the seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis ( Heu@@ v@@ u@@ p , caused by an allerg@@ y against poll@@ en infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory inflamm@@ ation ) in patients with no@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es ( stopped nose ) .
for adults and teenagers over 12 years , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ aze twice daily is one tablet , which should be taken with a glass of water or without food .
the duration of treatment should be as short as possible and terminated once the symptoms , especially the sw@@ elling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es ( stopped nose ) .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medication can be re@@ done on the const@@ ip@@ ation of the nose .
the main effective measures were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the ha@@ ylo@@ ft symptoms which were reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in consideration of all Heu@@ v@@ u@@ pf@@ ens@@ ac symptoms except for the const@@ ip@@ ation of the nose reported patients , the Aer@@ in@@ aze &apos;s income , compared with a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared with 3@@ 5.9 % compared to the patients suffering from the disease in the disease .
when only the sw@@ elling of the no@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es were considered , the patients were treated under Aer@@ in@@ aze a reduction of symptoms by 3@@ 7.4 % versus 26.@@ 7 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients that des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin alone proceeds .
the most common adverse events of Aer@@ in@@ aze ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are Tach@@ yon , mental arith@@ met@@ ical hyper@@ activity ( hyper@@ tension ) , const@@ ip@@ ation , head@@ ache , ti@@ red@@ ness , ti@@ red@@ ness , In@@ som@@ nia ( ins@@ om@@ nia ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sl@@ ump ) , sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces and nerv@@ ousness .
Aer@@ in@@ aze may not be applied to patients who may not be sensitive to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin or one of the other parts , against ad@@ ore substances or Lor@@ at@@ adin ( another medic@@ inal product to treat allergi@@ es ) are not applied .
Aer@@ in@@ aze may not be applied to patients that suffer from a narrow angle glaucoma ( hyper@@ tension ) , heart or v@@ ascular diseases ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ osis ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ osis ( over@@ sight of thy@@ ro@@ id ) or already have a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic impact ( caused by a brain ble@@ eding ) or having a risk for a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic impact .
on 30 July 2007 the European Commission granted the Company SP Europe to approval for placing the placing of aer@@ in@@ aze in the entire European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however , is in total to swal@@ low it ( i.e. without breaking them to break or cut up ) .
Aer@@ in@@ aze should not be used in children under 12 years due to the lack of data for in@@ fertil@@ ity and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible , and should not be continued after the symptoms of the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days , since at long time application the activity of P@@ seu@@ do@@ met@@ ed@@ rin can take time .
after a decline in the sw@@ elling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respir@@ atory case , treatment with dessert can be continued as a mono@@ therap@@ ist .
since Aer@@ in@@ aze P@@ seu@@ do@@ dh@@ ed@@ rin , the medicine is also contra@@ dic@@ ated in patients that are treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or or within 2 weeks after the termination of such therapy .
this is due to the ill@@ am@@ im@@ et@@ ical activity of the combination of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin , with other v@@ aso@@ con@@ stri@@ ctors , Per@@ go@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ y@@ amin or other dec@@ on@@ gest@@ iv@@ a , the per@@ oral or nas@@ al than abnormal . phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ amine , phen@@ yl pro@@ pan@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ gen@@ in , eph@@ ati@@ rin , Ox@@ y@@ C@@ az@@ olin , Nap@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) .
the safety and effectiveness of these combination therapy were not checked for this patient &apos;s patient and data are not sufficient to discuss appropriate recommendations .
safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ aze have not checked in patients with kidney or liver function and data are not sufficient to address corresponding recommendations for the dosage .
patients must be informed about that treatment at occurr@@ ence of hyper@@ tension or from Pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhyth@@ ms , di@@ arr@@ hyth@@ mia , nau@@ sea or et@@ ai@@ ding other neuro@@ logic symptoms ( such as head@@ ache or a ampli@@ fication of the head@@ aches ) must be removed .
in the treatment of following patients groups : • patients under D@@ IG@@ IT@@ AL@@ IS • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with hyper@@ tension inf@@ ar@@ ction in the an@@ am@@ ines , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder , or bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ asmus at the An@@ am@@ nese .
Aer@@ in@@ aze must termin@@ ate at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , as anti@@ hist@@ amine , otherwise agreed upon indicators for skin reaction , or reduce in its extent .
in the framework of clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , in which Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol was also given , however , no clin@@ ically relevant interaction or changes of the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin were observed .
in the results of psych@@ ic @-@ controlled tests , no significant differences between the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine and placebo was detected , regardless of whether des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine was alone or taken with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine enzyme was not yet identified , so that inter@@ actions with other medicines can not be excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in@@ hib@@ its in vivo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in vitro studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hib@@ its and neither a substr@@ ate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
the in@@ ability of use of aer@@ in@@ aze during pregnancy is not backed by a large number of pregn@@ an@@ cies , however , no increase in frequency of ab@@ normal@@ ities in comparison to the frequency of the normal population .
since re@@ productive studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and due to the v@@ ascular properties of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin should not be applied to aer@@ in@@ aze in pregnancy .
however , patients should be clari@@ fied in fact that in very rare cases it can occur in very rare cases that can lead to a impair@@ ment or ability to serve machines .
symptoms can vary between one Z@@ NS depression ( se@@ dation , Ap@@ no@@ e , reduced mental attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , heart circulation coll@@ aps ) and one Z@@ NS @-@ stim@@ ulation ( ins@@ om@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , Tre@@ mor , con@@ vul@@ tures ) with possible breast@@ feeding .

a z@@ NS @-@ stim@@ ulation is particularly likely in children , like at@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth tro@@ scopy , pup@@ il rigid and - di@@ lat@@ ation , hood , hyper@@ ther@@ mia , and gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal symptoms ) .
these include both inhibit@@ ing of pro@@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory cy@@ to@@ kin@@ en such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 of human ma@@ stic cells / bas@@ oph@@ ile , as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adju@@ v@@ ant molec@@ ule P sel@@ ess on endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
in an individual dosage study with adults Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement sizes of the flight performance including the ampli@@ fication of sub@@ jective or the tasks that are connected to flies .
in controlled clinical studies , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg , no increased frequency of di@@ spar@@ ity was detected in comparison to placebo .
the oral application of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin in the recommended dosage can produce more sympath@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a speed@@ ometer or manifest@@ ations of a z@@ NS @-@ reg@@ ression .
there were 1,@@ 248 patients at the age between 12 and 78 years with seasonal rhin@@ itis , with 414 patients received Aer@@ in@@ aze pills .
in both studies the hist@@ amin@@ ant@@ agon@@ ist effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets , determines from the total number of symptoms ( apart from nas@@ al den@@ sely sw@@ elling ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with P@@ anti@@ d@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin for the 2 weeks treatment period .
the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ aze Tablets with regard to the sw@@ elling effect , determines from the nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ inal sw@@ elling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin on the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aer@@ in@@ aze tablets showed no significant differences in regard to sex , age or ethnic origin .
within a single dose study on pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of Aer@@ in@@ aze &apos;s des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is det@@ ectable in plasma 30 minutes after administration .
after the per@@ or@@ atory application of Aer@@ in@@ aze in healthy volunteers over 14 days , the flu@@ ency of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and P@@ seu@@ do@@ wel rin on Day 10 was achieved .
as part of a pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic multi @-@ dos@@ sier , which was carried out using the formulation as a tablet to healthy adult subjects , was found that four subjects of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was badly damaged .
an components @-@ interaction study shows that exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin , according to the sole gift of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin , bio@@ equivalent to exposure to an Aer@@ in@@ aze tablet .
based on the conventional studies on safety technology , tox@@ icity in repet@@ itive gift , tox@@ icity and re@@ produc@@ ibility . however , the pre@@ clinical data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin provide any special haz@@ ards of human beings .
the combination had no greater tox@@ icity than its individual components and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin .
in re@@ productive clinical trials , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adin / P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin during a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits were not ter@@ ated in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .

A@@ eri@@ us was studied in total eight studies comprising about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhin@@ itis ( including four studies in seasonal rhin@@ itis and two trials in patients who had also as@@ thma ) .
the effectiveness was measured by the change in symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of p@@ add@@ ling , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance on the day ) and after six weeks of treatment was determined .
further studies have been submitted to prove that the body makes the sy@@ rup , solution to remove and processed melt in the same way as the tablets and use in children are un@@ th@@ ink@@ able .
in allergic rhin@@ itis , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us became an average decrease in the sympt@@ om scores ( sympt@@ om points ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decline of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving placebo .
in the two studies in Ur@@ ti@@ kar@@ ia , the decline of sympt@@ om scores after six @-@ week treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % compared to patients treated with placebo patients .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be applied to patients , possibly over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , Lor@@ at@@ adin or one of the other parts .
in January 2001 , the European Commission granted the Company SP Europe to approval for the placing of A@@ eri@@ us throughout the European Union .
one tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , for the reduction of symptoms in allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ ti@@ kar@@ ia ( see section 5.1 ) .
there are limited experience of clinical trials for efficacy in use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin with adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis ( appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should occur according to the previous illness , and it may be resum@@ ed after finishing the symptoms and the symptoms are resum@@ ed .
the persistent rhin@@ itis ( appearance of symptoms to 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) may be recommended to patients during the allerg@@ y period .

in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol the most efficient effect of alcohol is not reinforced ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be clari@@ fied in fact that in very rare cases it can occur in very rare cases , that can lead to a impair@@ ment or ability to serve machines .
in clinical trials in different indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us were reported in patients who were treated with placebo .
the most common adverse events that were more common in placebo were fatigue ( 1,2 % ) , mouth tro@@ scopy ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.6 % ) .
in a clinical study with 5@@ 78 you@@ thful patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side @-@ head@@ ache was treated with 5.9 % of the patients who were treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and in 6.9 % of patients treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose trial which were given up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nine clinical dose ) , no clinical @-@ relevant effects were observed .
this includes both inhibit@@ ing of pro@@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory cy@@ to@@ kin@@ en such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 of human ma@@ stic cells / bas@@ oph@@ ile , as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the Ad@@ mon@@ astic molec@@ ule P sel@@ ess on En@@ do@@ th@@ eli@@ al@@ cells .
in the framework of a clinical study with multiple outlets , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statistically significant or clinical @-@ related cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , showed no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c intervals .
in an individual dos@@ sier study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement sizes including the ampli@@ fication of sub@@ jective or the tasks that are connected to flies .
in patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in reducing the symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , Nas@@ en@@ rol@@ tion and Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ ot and ro@@ cking of eyes as well as Ju@@ ck@@ ri@@ z on the pal@@ ate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rhin@@ itis can be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis and persistent rhin@@ itis .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent rhin@@ itis is defined as the appearance of symptoms at 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as shown in the total of questionn@@ aire to life quality in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively decreased the pollution due to seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis .
the chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria was designated as a representative for other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , since the underlying path@@ ology of path@@ ology was similar to different forms and chronic patients .
since the hist@@ ological release is an caus@@ al factor in all ur@@ ari@@ ous diseases , it is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin also demonstrated in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ le@@ ia in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective when improvement in Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the size of qu@@ add@@ les at the end of the first dose of dose .

improvement of jew@@ ellery by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and wax significantly , as measured by a 4 @-@ point rating for evalu@@ ating these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic study , which patients were similar to patients with the general seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis -@@ population , was achieved in 4 % of patients a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin .
there are no evidence points for clinical @-@ relevant cum@@ ulation after a daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5- 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine enzyme , however , was not yet identified , so that inter@@ actions with other medicines will not be excluded

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals to prevent symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ ti@@ kar@@ ia ( see section 5.1 ) .
the pres@@ cription doctor should be aware of that most cases of rhin@@ itis in children under 2 years are caused by infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data suggest that a treatment of inf@@ ectious rhin@@ itis with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respir@@ atory cases , or anatom@@ ical anom@@ al@@ ies , the diagnosis of an@@ am@@ ism , physical investigations and appropriate laboratory and skin tests should play a role .
some 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin limited and learn a higher sub@@ static load ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , the met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed , is identical to the children that is normally met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed .
this drug contains suc@@ rose and Sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients with her@@ ed@@ itary problems of a fru@@ ct@@ ose int@@ ol@@ er@@ ance , gl@@ ucose @-@ g@@ act@@ ose absorption or a sac@@ char@@ ase @-@ in@@ suff@@ iciency of this medication should not be taken .
clin@@ ically relevant interaction between clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets were not detected , in which Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were also given ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , suffering from ag@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol was not reinforced with the most efficient effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the total th@@ reading of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group as in the placebo group .
in clinical trials with adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ ia , were reported in the recommended dose of 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents , at which up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nine clinical dose ) were given , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
children between the ages of 1 and 11 who came to a question of anti@@ hist@@ ological therapy , received a daily des@@ lor@@ at@@ ind@@ ul@@ osis of 1.25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2,5 m@@ g. ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rhin@@ itis / chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated with adults on the children &apos;s population .
in the framework of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statistically significant or clinical @-@ relevant cardiovascular effect was described .

in June 2008 , Nov@@ art@@ is V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. was officially recognized by the Committee on Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) that the company ret@@ ains its application for the placing of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov for prevention of the viol@@ inist H@@ 5@@ N1 influenza in adults and older people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be applied to the protection against the flu caused by the tribe ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N1 of the In@@ flu@@ enza @-@ A virus .
this is a special kind of vacc@@ ination that could cause a strain of influenza , to protect a future pan@@ demic .
the epidemic breaks out when a new strain of Gri@@ pp@@ ev@@ irus diving , which can easily be spread out of human being , because humans have no immun@@ ity ( no protection ) against it .
after administration of the vaccine , the immune system det@@ ects the immune system contained in the vacc@@ ination of influenza virus and forms an antibody against it .
this makes the immune system later in the position to form a contact with a Gri@@ pp@@ ev@@ irus of this family @-@ faster antibodies .
afterwards , the membrane cover of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( protein found on the membrane surface that det@@ ects the human body as physical activity ) , are cleaned and used as a component of the vaccine .
a inspection of some of the study centers showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
thereby , the scope of the clinical data base for the assessment of the vaccine must not be fulfilled in order to fulfil the requirements of the guidelines of the EMEA for pre@@ pan@@ demic vacc@@ ines .
if you need to participate in a clinical trial and require further information on your treatment , please contact your doctor &apos;s doctor .
if you require further information regarding the recommendations of the CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is applied in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immun@@ ode@@ ficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which caused the acquired immun@@ ode@@ ficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who can &apos;t swal@@ low capsules , A@@ gen@@ ase is available as a solution for adjusting , but this can not be taken together with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the safety of this combination was not examined .
A@@ gen@@ ase should only be classified when the doctor has examined what an@@ tivir@@ al medicines had previously taken before , and the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood is judged that the virus will speak to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which together with twice daily 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines .
for children between four and twelve years and with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gen@@ ase is based on body weight .
A@@ gen@@ ase reduces HIV in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines at a low level in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines .
AIDS is not able to heal the immune system , so that the development of associated infections and diseases would not hesitate .
A@@ gen@@ ase , in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines , however , was examined without R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults , which previously did not have been treated with prot@@ ease .
with low do@@ si@@ onal R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced medicines A@@ gen@@ ase , was compared with 206 adults , which had taken earlier prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or compared with other proteins .
main Indi@@ c@@ ator for the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable concentrations of HIV in blood ( vir@@ us@@ load ) or the change of vir@@ al load after treatment .
in the studies of patients who had no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or had taken after 48 weeks in gen@@ gen@@ ase more patients a vir@@ al load of 400 copies / ml as under Placebo , but A@@ gen@@ ase had less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gen@@ ase also reduced the vir@@ us@@ last , but with the children who had been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or were only very few to the treatment .
in the study with adults who were treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or were treated with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced medicines A@@ gen@@ ase the vir@@ al load after 16 weeks of treatment as well as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or :
in the patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , it came together with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r with a stronger tr@@ ash of vir@@ al load after four weeks than in the patients who proceeds up their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or :
the most common adverse events of A@@ gen@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( kidney ) , Nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , vom@@ iting , r@@ ash and F@@ atigue strength ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gen@@ ase cannot be applied to patients that are possibly over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r or one of the other components .
A@@ gen@@ ase can also not be applied to patients , the cur@@ rant herb ( a vegetable preparation for treating depression ) or pharmac@@ euticals , which are in the same as A@@ gen@@ ase , and are in high concentrations in blood health harmful .
as with other medicines for HIV , the gen@@ gen@@ ase , the risk of a li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rophy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , an oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose ( symptoms of bone tissue ) or a immune activ@@ ist ( symptoms of infection that causes recovery immune system ) .
in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines , the Medic@@ ines Committee ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the benefits of gen@@ eric inhibit@@ or in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines are treated with HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
A@@ gen@@ ase is generally taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics amplifiers R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee noted that the benefit of gen@@ eric inhibit@@ or in patients who have not taken no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or .
A@@ gen@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; since the time of approval for scientific reasons , only limited information .
October 2000 , the European Commission granted the G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited by approval for placing the placing of A@@ gen@@ ase in the entire European Union .
gen@@ eric is found in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1- , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or ( PI ) -@@ previously treated adults and children over 4 years .
usually A@@ gen@@ ase capsules are supposed to be administered to the pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ d boo@@ sted by Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual vir@@ al resistance of the patients and the pre @-@ treatment of the patients ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bi@@ dder angle of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r as a solution for inser@@ ting is 14 % less than one capsule ; therefore , A@@ gen@@ ase capsules and solution for inser@@ ting on a milli@@ grams per milli@@ grams is not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gen@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r twice daily with 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines .
2 If A@@ gen@@ ase capsules without the reinforced additive of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sted ) must be applied , higher doses have to be applied to gen@@ gen@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gen@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics , efficacy and safety of gen@@ gen@@ ase in combination with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other Prot@@ eas@@ ants were not examined in children .
A@@ gen@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age , based on the lack of data to in@@ compreh@@ ension and efficacy ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic data , the dose to A@@ gen@@ ase capsules in adult patients with medium @-@ heavier liver function is reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with heavy liver function is reduced to 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous application should be used in patients with mild or even liver function when patients with severe liver function is con@@ tra @-@ inde@@ xed ( see Section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gen@@ ase cannot be given simultaneously with drugs which have a small therapeutic width and also display substr@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
vegetable supplements , the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ation ) may not be applied due to the risk of reducing plasma concentration and a reduced therapeutic effect of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r during the intake of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be noted that gen@@ gen@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy did not lead to a cure of HIV infection , and that they may continue to develop opportun@@ ist infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy including treatment with A@@ gen@@ ase prevents HIV from HIV to other by sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually A@@ gen@@ ase capsules are supposed to be applied together with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients who suffer chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy , an increased risk of severe liver inter@@ actions with potentially fatal course .
for the case of simultaneous treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information about this medicine .
patients with pre @-@ existing liver function including chronic hepatitis men demonstrate an increased frequency of liver function under an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous application of A@@ gen@@ ase and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r with fluor@@ tic@@ ason or other gl@@ ucose levels are not recommended unless the potential benefit of a treatment is over@@ taking the risk of systematic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and support of the side @-@ level function ( see section 4.5 ) .
since the reduction of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ a @-@ Re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of A@@ gen@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opia including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sen .
4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ yl anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and War@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of International normal@@ ization ratio ) , methods to determine the concentration of action .
in patients receiving these medicines at the same time , A@@ gen@@ ase can be less effective because of the reduced plasma concentration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of met@@ abolic effects associated with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hor@@ m@@ onal contra@@ ction can be changed , however , the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of inter@@ actions .
when meth@@ ad@@ on is given simultaneously with am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on oo@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ ss@@ y@@ mptom@@ ome , especially if there are also low doses of r@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of the possible risk content of a tox@@ icity in due to the high propylene gly@@ col solution , this formulation is contra@@ cted in children under an age of four years and should be applied with care in certain other patient groups .
A@@ gen@@ ase should be set to duration 5 if an impact is accompanied by systematic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
patients who received anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , has been reported about the occurr@@ ence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia or an incidence of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases related to their therapy medicines that are associated with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , or hyper@@ glyc@@ emia .
B. higher age , and with pharmaceutical @-@ dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment and associated met@@ abolic disorders , associated .
patients ( type A and B ) that were treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or are reports of an increase of ble@@ eding including spontan@@ eous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ oma and hem@@ at@@ thro@@ es .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immun@@ ode@@ gra@@ ding patients , an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) can develop a flamm@@ able reaction to as@@ y@@ mptom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ ous opportun@@ ist infections which leads to severe clinical circumstances or deteri@@ oration .
although a multi@@ fac@@ tor@@ ial equ@@ ator@@ ial is assumed ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ero@@ ids , alcohol consumption , higher body @-@ measure index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose in particular in patients with advanced HIV @-@ disease and / or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) .
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 substr@@ ates with low therapeutic width of A@@ gen@@ ase may not simultaneously possess certain therapeutic width and also display substr@@ ates of cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 substr@@ ates with low therapeutic width of A@@ gen@@ on@@ avi@@ r can not be combined with pharmac@@ euticals , whose active ingredients are primarily used via CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and associated with increased plasma factors with serious and / or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and lead to a resistance development .
attemp@@ ting to compens@@ ate the lowest plasma factors due to a dose increase of other protein inhibit@@ ors in combination with r@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very frequently un@@ wanted effects were observed in the liver .
Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ation ) The serum mirror of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r can be lowered by simultaneous use of plant preparation with Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ation ) .
if the patient takes part in the direction of Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut , the Am@@ b@@ rist@@ av@@ ir@@ spiegel and , if possible , to check the vir@@ us@@ load and remove the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut .
a dose adjustment for one of the medic@@ inal product is not necessary when clo@@ ve is administered along with am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ sh@@ ir@@ k below ) .
508 % increased , for C@@ max , by 30 % , when R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ b@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , dos@@ ages of 600 mg of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r were used twice daily and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily used to prove the effectiveness and in@@ fertil@@ ity of this treatment schem@@ atic .
52 % lower when Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with cal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg l@@ op@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of L@@ op@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , however , a close monitoring is recommended because the effectiveness and in@@ ability of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic study on the use of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , however , due to the ant@@ a@@ ci@@ de component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , however , the revenue from Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gen@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see Ant@@ azi@@ da below ) .
therefore , in combination with am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and r@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose adjustment is required .
treatment with egg de@@ men@@ tia in combination with am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended since the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or would be lower .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ ins on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data can be assumed that Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin could possibly be det@@ on@@ ated by Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r .
in case this drug should be used simultaneously , caution , since Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din due to the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma factors may be less effective .
when these medicines are used together , caution is commanded ; a thor@@ ough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical surveillance should be made , as an exact forecast of the effect of the combination of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r are difficult to be difficult .
the simultaneous administration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ om@@ ut@@ in led to an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of Ri@@ om@@ ut@@ in to 193 % and thus leads to an increase of ri@@ fug@@ al side effects .
when it is required for clinical reasons , Ri@@ om@@ ut@@ in together with A@@ gen@@ ase will be sufficient to reduce the dosage of Ri@@ ber@@ ut@@ in at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data lie .
pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ic studies with A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in were not performed but could be increased the plasma factors of both medicines in case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg of F@@ os@@ amp@@ er avi@@ r with 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day resulted in an increase of the amount of C@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol in plasma by 25 % and AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ } ) to 2.@@ 69@@ times in comparison to the value , which was observed once daily without simultaneous use of F@@ os@@ amp@@ er avi@@ r with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r once daily .
other medicines that are listed below , including Sub@@ str@@ ate , inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can be used together with A@@ gen@@ ase , possibly lead to inter@@ actions .
patients should therefore be associated to toxic reactions that are associated with these medicines if they are used in combination with A@@ gen@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors it is advis@@ able that Ant@@ azi@@ da should not be taken at the same time as A@@ gen@@ ase , as it can come to res@@ or@@ ption disorders .
the simultaneous application of anti @-@ vul@@ si@@ ves known as enzy@@ mes are known ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r can lead to a t@@ lower of the plasma factors of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r .
the serum levels of calcium @-@ kan@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , di@@ pin , di@@ pin , pine @-@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ et@@ pin , N@@ ins@@ di@@ pin , N@@ ins@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased 10 by Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , thereby increasing the activity and tox@@ icity of this medicine .
the con@@ gest@@ ion with A@@ gen@@ ase can significantly increase their plasma concentration and enhance P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in conjunction with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including h@@ yp@@ ot@@ ment , vision and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in the R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily , together with 50 µg of Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days were increased , while endo@@ genous K@@ ort@@ is@@ ol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % de@@ fi@@ de interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous administration of A@@ gen@@ ase with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r would not be recommended to these gl@@ ucose concentrations together with these gl@@ ucose concentrations , unless the potential benefit of a treatment is the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stly ( see section 4.4 ) .
in H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ a @-@ Re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose contamination are strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are distinctive enh@@ ancements of the plasma factors at the same administration of A@@ gen@@ ase .
since plasma factors of this H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ a @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opath@@ y including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , it is not recommended to combined use of this drug using Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r .
a frequency monitoring of therapeutic concentrations as to stabil@@ ization of the mirror is recommended since the plasma concentration of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ yc@@ in and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased with the benefit of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.4 ) .
therefore , Act shall not be applied together with oral @-@ recorded ten@@ d@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , while using A@@ gen@@ ase , with par@@ ent@@ ric Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am be charged .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ aly@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors refer to a possible increase in plasma factors from Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am to 3 @-@ 4 times .
when meth@@ ad@@ on is administered together with am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on oo@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ ss@@ y@@ mptom@@ ome , especially if there are still low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of the very low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation can be given as Am@@ b@@ av@@ ir@@ - dose is given when Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one .
in simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gen@@ ase , a ampli@@ fication of the IN@@ R ( International normal@@ ized ratio ) is recommended due to the possibility of weak or ampli@@ fication of the anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hor@@ m@@ onal contra@@ ction is not predic@@ table , therefore also alternative methods for the conception of conception .
a careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amin and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ til@@ in ) is recommended for the simultaneous administration of A@@ gen@@ ase ( see Section 4.4 ) .
during pregnancy , this drug may only be used after a careful remedy of the possible uses for the mother in comparison with the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
in the milk l@@ activated rats , Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r @-@ related fabrics have been proven , however , it is not known whether Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r are explo@@ red in breast milk .
a re@@ productive study of wor@@ sen@@ ed rats who was administered by the in@@ ni@@ zation in the u@@ terus to the end of the breast@@ feeding of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase of 12 body weight during pregnancy .
the further development of child@@ birth including fertil@@ ity and reproduction was not imp@@ aired by the administration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r to the parent .
the in@@ denti@@ ality of A@@ gen@@ ase was studied in adults and children 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines .
most of these side effects associated with the A@@ gen@@ ase treatment were slightly up to be completed , early in the early morning , and rarely led to the treatment process .
many of these events is not clari@@ fied whether they are in connection with the in@@ gest@@ ion of gen@@ gen@@ ase or another at the same time to the HIV @-@ treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the disease &apos;s disease .
most of the above @-@ mentioned adverse events are from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which the previously untreated patients were not previously treated with 1200 mg of A@@ gen@@ ase twice daily .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were reported standing by the examination in connection with the study medication , and in more than 1 % of patients were performed , as well as in the treatment of im@@ aging lab changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) .
the anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy was associated with a distribution of body fat ( Li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rophy ) in HIV @-@ patients , including a loss of peripheral and fa@@ una fat tissue , increasing intra@@ ocular and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ t@@ rophy of the breasts and dor@@ o@@ rect@@ al fat collection ( Sti@@ cks ) .
under 113 anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al non @-@ treated persons who had been treated with am@@ b@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ in / z@@ id@@ ov@@ ud@@ in over a medium length of 36 weeks was only one case ( Sti@@ cks ) ( &lt; 1 % ) .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , 245 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - pre @-@ treated patients were performed under Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a medium length of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.001 ) .
skin covers usually slightly mild to moderate , er@@ y@@ them@@ ed or ma@@ cult nature , with or without ju@@ ck@@ ri@@ z and usually occur during the second treatment week and disappeared spontan@@ e@@ ously within two weeks , without causing the treatment with am@@ b@@ avi@@ r had to be canc@@ eled .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose cases were especially reported in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV @-@ disease or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immun@@ ode@@ ficiency effect , an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) can develop flamm@@ able reaction to as@@ y@@ mptom@@ atic or resi@@ den@@ ial opportun@@ ist infections ( see Section 4.4 ) .
patients treated with PI pre@@ treated R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Grade 3 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were observed twice daily with low @-@ conden@@ sed R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Grade 3 and 4 ) , which were observed with low glyc@@ eri@@ de and CP@@ K values , who received A@@ gen@@ ase in patients who received A@@ gen@@ ase together with low @-@ sensitive R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in case of an over@@ dosage , the patient is on signs of a po@@ is@@ ic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) , if necessary , necessary support measures are necessary .
Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active center of the HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and prevents the proc@@ essi@@ vely vir@@ al g@@ ag@@ - and g@@ ag @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ nom@@ en@@ ants with the consequence of a formation of un@@ disp@@ uted , non @-@ inf@@ ectious vir@@ al particles .
the an@@ tivir@@ al activity of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r in vitro was studied against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB both in acute and chronic ly@@ mpho@@ cy@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as in peripheral blood ly@@ mpho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % inhibit@@ or concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0,0@@ 12 to 0.08 µ@@ M in acute cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells
the connection between the activity of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and in@@ hibition of the HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved F@@ os@@ amp@@ l@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r doses have been observed - as with other R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r blocked treatment schem@@ as with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the described mut@@ ations only rarely observed .
in sixteen years of 434 anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al patients who received 700@@ mg of F@@ os@@ amp@@ ut@@ l@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in the study ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 , a vi@@ ro@@ logical error occurred up to week 48 , with 14 isol@@ ate gen@@ otype could be studied .
gen@@ otype analysis of Isol@@ ate of 13 of 14 children , where a vi@@ ro@@ logical error occurred within the 59 closed , with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or not treated patients showed resistance patterns that were similar to those with adults .
L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 3@@ I , K@@ 20@@ R , K@@ 3@@ I , I@@ 3@@ I , I@@ 50@@ V , I@@ 50@@ V , I@@ 54@@ V , I@@ 54@@ V , I@@ 54@@ V , I@@ 54@@ V , I@@ 54@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2A / I , I@@ 84@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M , and I@@ 93@@ L / M .
in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 and their extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 and their extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg F@@ os@@ amp@@ l@@ avi@@ r twice daily : N = 107 ) in patients with vi@@ ro@@ om@@ ic pro@@ hibit@@ ors over 96 weeks , the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or mut@@ ations were observed :
based on gen@@ otype resistance tests , Gen@@ otyp@@ ical interpre@@ tations can be used to estimate the activity of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ 11 algorithm for f@@ os@@ amp@@ ra@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r defined resistance than the presence of the mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / I , I@@ 54@@ A / C / F / F / F , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with a decreased resistance to F@@ os@@ amp@@ l@@ avi@@ r with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r and a reduced probability of a vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) .
conclusions regarding the relev@@ ance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation pattern can be subject to additional data , and it is recommended to use the actual interpre@@ tations systems for analysis of the results of resistance tests .
based on ph@@ ant@@ ine resistance tests , clin@@ ically vali@@ dated evaluation systems can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ical data for estim@@ ation of the activity of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors isol@@ ates .
companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic Cut @-@ offs ( divi@@ ders ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used for interpretation of results of a resistance tests .
each of these four with an reduced sensitivity against Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r associated genetic pattern creates a certain degree resistant against R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity against in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r .
there are currently data to cross @-@ resistant between Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or for all 4 f@@ os@@ amp@@ l@@ avi@@ r resistance to either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
based on five @-@ twenty anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al patients ( one of them demonstrated a resistance against L@@ op@@ in@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 Isol@@ ate ) , In@@ car@@ in@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 trials ) , cat@@ ch@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 ins@@ ulators ) and Tip@@ ran@@ vi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 ins@@ ulators ) and Tip@@ ran@@ vi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 ins@@ ulators ) .
vice versa , Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ret@@ ains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or isol@@ ate near ; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in isol@@ ates .
early termination of a reconc@@ iled therapy is recommended to keep the infection of a variety of mut@@ ations in the limits that can act on the following treatment .
the proof of the efficacy of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily based on the study ( Vir@@ us@@ load ≥ 1000 copies twice daily ) together with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ st@@ o@@ sid@@ pi@@ oga ( N@@ RT@@ I ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with lowest R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
one hundred thre@@ es@@ core and sixty @-@ thre@@ es@@ core ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to as@@ gen@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the study study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis showed the non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AP@@ V / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI Group in terms of time @-@ adjusted average change from the output value ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ maintenance wave of 0.4 log@@ ged copies / ml .
the proof of the efficacy of un@@ le@@ ath@@ ered A@@ gen@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were treated with PI .
in studies , A@@ gen@@ ase solution to take and capsules into dos@@ ages of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no low do@@ si@@ zed R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of those treated with PI pre@@ treated patients had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s combined with A@@ gen@@ ase .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the patients enrolled in the study included a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration of &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml with a median increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) .
19 Based on these data should be considered to be considered to be considered with PI pre@@ treated children who are considered to be considered as expected &quot; A@@ gen@@ ase . &quot;
after oral administration the average length ( T@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r amounts approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
508 % increased , for C@@ max in contrast to 30 % when R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % reduction in AU@@ C but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore the minimum concentration in the ste@@ ady @-@ State ( C@@ min , s@@ s ) remains un@@ affected by the food intake , although the simultaneous intake increases the extent and the rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and allows to close a large distribution volume and a broad penetration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r from the blood circulation in the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of action in plasma , with the amount of unlimited Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active portion , probably remain unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ born Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active substances varies in the ste@@ ady activity of the ste@@ ady state in the ste@@ ady state over the area of C@@ max , s@@ s to C@@ min , s@@ s .
hence the pharmac@@ euticals , CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induced or in@@ hib@@ itions or a substr@@ ate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 are given , with caution if they are given simultaneously with A@@ gen@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gen@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice daily or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to a similar daily Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r exposure such as adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r is made from the solution 14 % less bio @-@ available as well as from the capsules ; therefore A@@ gen@@ ase solution and A@@ gen@@ ase capsules are not re@@ plac@@ eable at a single gram@@ m@@ basis .
also , the ren@@ al cle@@ aring of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ le@@ cted , therefore the impact of a ren@@ al function occurs on elim@@ ination of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these treatment schem@@ es lead to am@@ b@@ avi@@ r plasma screens like those who have achieved in healthy volunteers according to a dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r twice daily without a simultaneous administration of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
in long @-@ term studies for can@@ ogen@@ icity with am@@ b@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats came to male animals of h@@ epat@@ ocy@@ an@@ ew Adenauer ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8- ( rat ) of exposure to humans , according to twice daily gift of 1200 mg of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , said .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ epat@@ o@@ cellular Aden@@ omas und Kar@@ zin@@ ome has not been clari@@ fied and the relev@@ ance of this observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
however , from the present study data on humans , both of clinical trials , as well as from the therapeutic use , however , had little indications for the assum@@ ption of a clinical relev@@ ance of this findings .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity tests , the bacterial reverse printing tests ( Am@@ es @-@ test ) , micro@@ core test in rats and chromosome test test in human peripheral ly@@ mpho@@ cy@@ tes were Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r neither mut@@ ations nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
these liver tox@@ icity can be monitored and proven in clinical use by measurement of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
until now in clinical studies , no significant tox@@ icity in patients was observed , neither during the administration of A@@ gen@@ ase even after the treatment .
studies on tox@@ icity at young , which were treated from an age of 4 days , showed both the control and using Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r treated animals a high mortality .
in a system@@ ic plasma exposition , significantly below ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) as the expected exposure of therapeutic dosage in humans were observed , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ muscles and lower sk@@ el@@ eton changes observed that indicate a delayed development .
24 If A@@ gen@@ ase capsules without the reinforced additive of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sted ) must be applied , higher doses have to be applied to gen@@ gen@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gen@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application should be used in patients with a weak or lighter liver function when patients with severe liver function is con@@ tra @-@ inde@@ xed ( see Section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ yl anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and War@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of International normal@@ ization ratio ) , methods to determine the concentration of action .
A@@ gen@@ ase should be set at duration 27 if an impact is accompanied by systematic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
an increased risk for a li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rophy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with pharmaceutical @-@ dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment and associated met@@ abolic disorders .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and lead to a resistance development .
508 % increased , for C@@ max , by 30 % , when R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ b@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of L@@ op@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , however , a close monitoring is recommended because the effectiveness and in@@ ability of this combination is not known .
treatment with egg de@@ men@@ tia in combination with am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended since the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or would be lower .
when these medicines are used together , caution is commanded ; a thor@@ ough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical surveillance should be made , as an exact forecast of the effect of the combination of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r are difficult to be difficult .
when it is required for clinical reasons , Ri@@ om@@ ut@@ in together with A@@ gen@@ ase will be sufficient to reduce the dosage of Ri@@ ber@@ ut@@ in at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although no clinical data lie .
the serum levels of calcium @-@ kan@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , di@@ odi@@ ac , di@@ pin , Nic@@ ah@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , N@@ ins@@ di@@ pin , N@@ ins@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , thereby increasing the activity and tox@@ icity of this medicine .
in a clinical study , in the R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily , together with 50 µg of Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days were increased , while endo@@ genous K@@ ort@@ is@@ ol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % de@@ fi@@ de interval 82 to 89 % ) .
in simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gen@@ ase , a ampli@@ fication of the IN@@ R ( International normal@@ ized ratio ) is recommended due to the possibility of weak or ampli@@ fication of the anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ th@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg Eth@@ in@@ y@@ le@@ stra@@ ol plus 1.0 mg No@@ re@@ th@@ in@@ dr@@ on ) led to a decrease of AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
during pregnancy , this medicine may only be applied only after a careful remedy of the possible uses for the mother in comparison with the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
a re@@ productive study of wor@@ sen@@ ed rats who was administered by the in@@ ni@@ zation in the u@@ terus to the end of the breast@@ feeding of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase in body weight during pregnancy .
the in@@ denti@@ ality of A@@ gen@@ ase was studied in adults and children 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines .
in case of an over@@ dosage , the patient is on signs of a po@@ is@@ ic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) , if necessary , necessary support measures are necessary .
the an@@ tivir@@ al activity of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r in vitro was studied against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB both in acute and chronic ly@@ mpho@@ cy@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood ly@@ mpho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % inhibit@@ or concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0,0@@ 12 to 0.08 µ@@ M in acute cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.50 µg / ml ) .
vice versa , Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ret@@ ains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or isol@@ ate near ; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in isol@@ ates .
based on these data , these data should be considered as expected to be considered to be considered to be considered to be considered as expected &quot; A@@ gen@@ ase &quot; using PI pre@@ treated children .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ born Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active substances varies in the ste@@ ady activity of the ste@@ ady state in the ste@@ ady state over the area of C@@ max , s@@ s to C@@ min , s@@ s ..
hence the pharmac@@ euticals , CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induced or in@@ hib@@ itions or a substr@@ ate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 are given , with caution if they are given simultaneously with A@@ gen@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
also , the ren@@ al cle@@ aring of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible ; therefore the impact of a ren@@ al function reduces the elim@@ ination of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies for can@@ ogen@@ icity with am@@ b@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats entered doses of male animals h@@ epat@@ ocy@@ an@@ ew Adenauer ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8- ( rat ) of exposure to people twice daily gift of 1200 mg of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of the h@@ epat@@ ocy@@ ular Aden@@ omas und Kar@@ zin@@ ome has not been clari@@ fied and the relev@@ ance of this observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
however , from the present study data on humans , both of clinical trials , as well as from the therapeutic use , however , few indications for the assum@@ ption of a clinical relev@@ ance of this findings .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity tests , the bacterial reverse printing tests ( Am@@ es @-@ test ) , micro@@ core test in rats and chromosome test test in human peripheral ly@@ mpho@@ cy@@ tes included , was Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r neither mut@@ ations nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
studies on tox@@ icity at young , which were treated from an age of 4 days , showed both the control and using Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r treated animals a high mortality .
these results indicate that in young the metabolism will not be fully mature , so that Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation is necessary ( z . ) .
gen@@ eric solution for inser@@ ting is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines for treating HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or ( PI ) -@@ previously treated adults and children from 4 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the benefit of using R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gen@@ ase solution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was done either with PI previously treated patients with PI pre@@ treated patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bi@@ dder angle of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r as a solution for inser@@ ting is 14 % less than one capsule ; therefore , A@@ gen@@ ase capsules and solution for inser@@ ting on a milli@@ grams per milli@@ grams is not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the patients should , as soon as they are able to swal@@ low capsules , taking the solution to take a solution ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gen@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 2800 mg of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , there is no dose of dose for the simultaneous use of A@@ gen@@ ase solution to insert and low @-@ controlled R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination would be avoided for these patient groups .
although a dose of dose for Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r is not necessary for use , an application of A@@ gen@@ ase solution for inser@@ ting patients with kidney failure ( see paragraph 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of high prop@@ yl@@ ation content , A@@ gen@@ ase solution for inclusion in small children and children under 4 years , among pregnant women , with reduced liver function or liver fail@@ ures and patients with kidney failure contra@@ cted .
the simultaneous administration may lead to a competent in@@ hibition of the metabolism of this drug and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects such as cardi@@ ac arr@@ hyth@@ mia ( z ) .
patients should be noted that gen@@ gen@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy did not lead to a cure of HIV infection , and that they continued to develop opportun@@ ist infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy including treatment with A@@ gen@@ ase prevents HIV / risk of HIV at other by sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , Phen@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and War@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of International normal@@ ization ratio ) , methods to determine the concentration of action .
A@@ gen@@ ase should be reduced to duration when an impact is accompanied by systematic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
an increased risk for a li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rophy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with medication @-@ 49 dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment and associated met@@ abolic disorders .
patients ( type A and B ) that were treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or are reports of an increase of ble@@ eding including spontan@@ eous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ oma and hem@@ at@@ thro@@ es .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and lead to a resistance development .
508 % increased , for C@@ max , by 30 % , when R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ b@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the con@@ gest@@ ion with A@@ gen@@ ase can significantly increase their plasma concentration and lead to P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in conjunction with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors ( see section 4.4 ) .
based on the data on 54 other CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am are expected to significantly higher plasma concentration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for humans is not known as A@@ gen@@ ase solution for inser@@ ting a toxic reactions of fo@@ et@@ us to the contains propylene gly@@ col in the pregnancy ( see Section 4.3 ) .

a re@@ productive study of wor@@ sen@@ ed rats who was administered by the in@@ ni@@ zation in the u@@ terus to the end of the breast@@ feeding of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase of 55 body weight during pregnancy .
the in@@ denti@@ ality of A@@ gen@@ ase was studied in adults and children 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines .
many of these events is not clari@@ fied whether they are in connection with the in@@ gest@@ ion of gen@@ gen@@ ase or another at the same time to the HIV @-@ treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the disease &apos;s disease .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved F@@ os@@ amp@@ l@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r doses have been observed - as with other R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r blocked treatment schem@@ as with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the described mut@@ ations only rarely observed .

for this reason , these patients should continue to be closely monitored , and the infusion of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be made in a reasonable clinical environment , in which recovery facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are available immediately .
due to the clinical Phase 3 study , almost all patients Ig@@ G @-@ antibodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , generally , is usually within 3 months from the course of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of inf@@ usi@@ oned reaction , must be treated with caution using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
as little experience concerning repe@@ ating the treatment after a longer break , due to the theoretical increased risk of risk provisions , the treatment must be c@@ auti@@ ous after an inter@@ ruption of treatment .
60 minutes before the beginning of infusion with medic@@ ations ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and / or anti @-@ py@@ lock ) to minim@@ ize the potential appearance of inf@@ usi@@ oned reactions .
in case of slight or moderate inf@@ usi@@ oned reaction , treatment with anti @-@ hist@@ amine and Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be hal@@ ted and / or a reduction of infusion rate to half of the infusion rate , in which the reaction has occurred .
in case of individual , heavy inf@@ usi@@ oned reaction , the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are brought to decline , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is needed .
infusion rate can be resum@@ ed on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of infusion rate when the inf@@ usi@@ rate has occurred .
3 ( Anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ika and Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction of infusion rate in 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of infusion rate , where the past reaction has occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or pro@@ c@@ ain , because a potential risk of interference with intra@@ cellular recording of lar@@ v@@ id@@ ase exists .
animal experimental studies do not leave direct or indirect adverse impacts on the pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
since there were no data on new@@ bor@@ ns that were exposed to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , above the breast milk , it is recommended to be silent during treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
side effects in clinical trials were classified primarily as inf@@ usi@@ oned reactions , which were observed in 53 % of patients in the phase 3 study ( treatment duration of up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under the age of 5 ( treatment duration of up to 1 year ) were observed .
un@@ wanted medication actions in connection with Al@@ thir@@ az@@ y@@ me , who were observed during the Phase 3 study and their extension in total 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older with a treatment duration of up to 4 years , are very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe MP@@ S @-@ I @-@ related participation of the upper air@@ ways and lungs in the pre@@ history , heavy reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ asmus , respir@@ atory , and fac@@ ial oils ( see Section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ wanted medication in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , who were reported in a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 , with predominantly de@@ formation form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months reported , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients it occurred within 3 months after the onset of treatment to a ser@@ op@@ o@@ version , with patients at the age of 5 years with a severe deteri@@ oration form ( on average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and older ) .
until the end of the phase 3 trial ( or to an early release from the study ) , 13 / 45 patients were detected by Radio@@ immun@@ op@@ cip@@ itation ( R@@ IP ) Ass@@ ay det@@ ectable , including 3 patients , with which it never came to Ser@@ con@@ ence .
patients with missing up to a low antibody ; a robust reduction in G@@ AG Spi@@ eg@@ els in Har@@ n , while in patients with high antibody tit@@ res was to set a variable reduction in G@@ AG in the har@@ n .
four patients ( three in the phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study ) demonstrated a mar@@ g@@ inal to low neutr@@ alis@@ ic effect on the enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ - activity in vitro that seemed to affect clinical efficacy and / or the reduction of G@@ AG in the har@@ n .
the presence of antibodies did not seem to stand with the incidence of un@@ desired pharmac@@ euticals , even if the occurr@@ ence of un@@ wanted medication actions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G @-@ antibodies .
the reasons for the enzy@@ mes is in one of the acute substr@@ ate and preventing a further accum@@ ulation suff@@ iciently restore the enzy@@ mes .
after intraven@@ ous infusion , lar@@ v@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the blood circulation and cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely via man@@ t @-@ 6 @-@ phosphate recept@@ ors .
safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were analysed in a randomised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study at 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recruited for the study , showing the entire disease spectrum , the majority of the patients received by the mean phen@@ otype and only one patient had the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recruited if they had an exp@@ o exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and it had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the efficacy were the percentage of anticipated FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk .
all patients were subsequently recruited for an open @-@ label renewal study where they received more than 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) every week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
after 26 weeks of therapy the patients were treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me compared to the placebo group an improvement of lung function and ability to see in the following table .
in the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintaining this effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ thir@@ az@@ y@@ me group and a group of 182 weeks in the placebo / al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as described in the following table .
the decrease in the increase percentage of the FE@@ V is not significant over this period of clinical and absolute pneum@@ onia increased propor@@ tionally to the height of growing children .
of the 26 patients with a h@@ epat@@ oma of patients reached 22 ( 85 % ) to the end of the study a normal liver size .
within the first 4 weeks , a significant decrease in the G@@ AG mirror in the Har@@ n ( µg / mg cre@@ at@@ ine ) was determined that remained constant until the academic year .
regarding hetero@@ gen@@ eous disease manifest@@ ation between the patients , which has been taken into account the clin@@ ically significant changes in the five @-@ minute walk test ( to be expected ) , no change in 10 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 9 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
an old open phase 2 study was conducted in which mainly the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was examined at 20 patients , who were in the study at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years old ( 16 patients with severe deteri@@ oration form and 4 with the middle course form ) .
in four patients the dosing was increased because of elevated GA@@ G@@ - mirrors in the Har@@ n week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg .
in several patients , a size of magnitude ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) was determined according to the Z @-@ Score for this age group The younger patients with severe deteri@@ oration form ( &lt; 2,5 years ) and all 4 patients with the middle course form had a normal mental development speed , whereas only no progress made in cogn@@ itive development .
in a phase 4 study , investigations into the dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosing schem@@ es were carried out on the G@@ AG mirror in the har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosage scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent in patients who have difficulty with weekly infusion ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosing schem@@ es is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will evaluate any new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the medicine is updated .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar to those in older and less strongly affected patients .

A@@ lim@@ ta is treated in patients who have previously untreated even other chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in and patients who previously applied other chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies .
to reduce side effects , the patient should receive a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as foli@@ c acid ( vitamin C ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta ( vitamin B12 ) and inj@@ ections of vitamin B12 .
when A@@ lim@@ ta is administered with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in , in addition , or after the administration of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in additionally a &quot; anti @-@ emet@@ ry &quot; ( medicines for vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent liquid defic@@ iency ) .
in patients whose blood is changed , or with which certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be taken up or reduced or the dosage should be reduced .
the active form of P@@ emet@@ re@@ v slow@@ ed down the formation of the DNA and RNA and prevents the cells .
the conversion of P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed in its active form is lighter than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of medication by means of a longer period of cancer cells .
for treatment of mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ ke , A@@ lim@@ ta was studied in a main study on 456 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy against their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta reported in a study on 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease which previously treated with chemotherapy , previously compared to doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another medic@@ inal drugs against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta is also compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( a further drug against cancer ) , both in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ plat@@ in survived average 12,@@ 1 months , compared to 9.3 months at the filing of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in .
patients who previously received chemotherapy was the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8.3 months compared to doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in 7.9 months .
however , in both studies , however , patients with cancer were not responsible for the record epi@@ thel@@ ial cells , during the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta longer survival , than with the comparative clinical medicine .

each bottle @-@ bottle must be eff@@ ected at 4.2 ml 0.9 % sodium chloride injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary wick dose is taken and diluted with 0.9 % sodium chloride injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see Section 6.6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is shown in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in to first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al@@ car@@ cin@@ oma except for vast sign of epi@@ thel@@ ial hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in two @-@ line treatment of patients with Lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al cancer . ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) administered as an intraven@@ ous infusion of a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment course .
the recommended dose of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as infusion of a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after the P@@ emet@@ ry infusion - infusion on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment course .
patients with non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al@@ car@@ cin@@ oma after prec@@ urs@@ ing chemotherapy is the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F administered as an intraven@@ ous infusion of a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of bon@@ net actions a day before and on the day of the P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed gift as well as the day after the treatment a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ero@@ id was given .
during seven days before the first dose P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed must be taken at least 5 doses of foli@@ c acid and intake must be continued during the whole treatment period and for another 21 days after the final P@@ emet@@ ry dosage .
patients must also receive in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection of vitamin B12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed dose and after each third bar cycle .
in patients treated with P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed , it should be created in front of every gift a complete blood pattern , including differentiation of the leu@@ k@@ ocy@@ tes and a Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ g@@ ale .
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ at trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Al@@ anine @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment course , a dose test must take place under consideration - the N@@ adi@@ rs of the blood of blood or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity of the forec@@ asted treatment cycles .
after recovery , the patients have to be treated according to the references in Tab@@ les 1 , 2 and 3 , to apply for AL@@ IM@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity Crit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 blood .
should patients develop non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ≥ degree 3 ( excluding neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , the patient must be interrupted with AL@@ IM@@ TA , until the patient needs the value before treatment
treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be canc@@ eled when patients occurs after 2 dose of hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity 3 or 4 or so@@ - continue at the appearance of grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
clinical studies have no indication that in patients at age 65 , or compared to patients at age 65 , an elevated side risk is increased .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to non @-@ sufficient data to in@@ compreh@@ ension and efficacy .
in clinical studies , in patients with a cre@@ at@@ ine Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min , there were no dose adjustments that may be recommended for all patients with recommended dose adjustments .
the data base in patients with a cre@@ at@@ ine Clear@@ ance of under 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in cases of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 times the upper limit value ( in presence of liver metast@@ ases ) are not studied especially in studies .
patients must not be monitored with regard to the bone structure and P@@ emet@@ re@@ v may not be given to patients before their absolute neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ ic number has a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ - cy@@ tes number again achieved a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose of dose for further cycles is based on the N@@ adir of absolute neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ ic number , Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ ten@@ numbers and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity , as they were observed in the previous therapy courses ( see Section 4.2 ) .
a lower tox@@ icity and a reduction of degrees 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity , like neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with degree 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , when a pre @-@ treatment with foli@@ c acid and vitamin B12 was carried out .
therefore all patients treated with P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed patients , foli@@ c acid and vitamin B12 should be used as proph@@ y@@ - l@@ act@@ ate measure to reduce tox@@ icity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s ) such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - c@@ yl@@ s ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days prior to therapy , at least 2 days prior to therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ v ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients who are intended for therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ v is necessary to avoid taking N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ life for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ v ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients receiving these events , corresponding risk factors for the occurr@@ ence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , existing hyper@@ tension or diabetes .
therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid tolerance in trans@@ cellular space a drainage of the connection to the P@@ emet@@ re@@ v treatment can be detected .
5 serious cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and her@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events were reported in clinical trials with P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed occasionally when this substance was usually given in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug .
for this reason , the simultaneous application atten@@ u@@ inated life dim@@ mer ( except yellow fever , these vacc@@ ination is con@@ tra @-@ indicated ) not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible skull was re@@ mixed by P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed , men should be pointed out to treatment - G@@ inn insi@@ sted on advice regarding the sperm enhancement .
in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non @-@ ster@@ oid chlor@@ ic acid ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) to a reduced P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed lot with a result of increasing awareness of side effects .
therefore be careful if patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can be used in high dosage .
I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ - acid in a high dosage for at least 2 days prior to therapy , must be avoided by treatment with P@@ emet@@ re@@ v ( see section 4.4 ) .
since there are no data concerning the interaction with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ life such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application must be avoided for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ - are avoided .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of coupling status during the disease and the possibility of inter@@ actions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplast@@ y chemotherapy requires increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International normal@@ ized ratio ) , if the decision was taken to treat the patient du@@ cks with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed near Schwan@@ res , but as in an@@ gu@@ ise anti@@ metabol@@ ites are expected to be severe birth defects .
P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed may not be applied during pregnancy , except if necessary , and after careful turning of the useful life for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible damage caused by P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed , men should be pointed out before the treatment start , consulting on the sperm cells .

AL@@ IM@@ TA ( P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed ) is an ant@@ in@@ ous anti @-@ fol@@ ate that assi@@ sts its effect , det@@ oxi@@ fy the fol@@ ly @-@ dependent met@@ abolic processes that are necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
in vitro studies revealed that P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed as anti @-@ fol@@ ate with several wars involved in developing the thy@@ mid@@ yl@@ ate reduc@@ t@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) and gly@@ cin@@ am@@ i@@ dri@@ o @-@ m@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , the fol@@ ate @-@ dependent key enzyme of the de nov@@ o Bi@@ os@@ yn@@ thesis by thy@@ mid@@ in@@ - and pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ us .
E@@ MP@@ OR@@ IS , a mul@@ tic@@ entr@@ e , randomised , simply @-@ blind Phase 3 study of AL@@ IM@@ TA plus C@@ is@@ plat@@ in treated patients with mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ om showed that with AL@@ IM@@ TA and C@@ is@@ plat@@ in treated patients a clin@@ ically significant advantage of a median 2.8 @-@ month survival compared to such patients who were only fast@@ ened with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in .
the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received the treatment arm in the treatment arm ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
a statistically significant improvement in clinical @-@ relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ e ) in connection with mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ om was shown in the use of lung disease in AL@@ IM@@ TA / C@@ is@@ plat@@ in arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the sole C@@ is@@ pla@@ it arm ( 218 patients ) .
the differences between the two treatment arms resulted in an improvement of lung fluid parameters in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / C@@ is@@ plat@@ in arm and a deteri@@ oration of lung function in the course of time in control .
a mul@@ tic@@ entr@@ e , randomised , open phase III study with AL@@ IM@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC after prior chemotherapy was treated with AL@@ IM@@ TA treated patients ( Int@@ ent to Tre@@ at Population n = 283 ) and from 7,9 months in patients with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el treated patients ( ITT n = 288 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on the overall survival effect of AL@@ IM@@ TA in patients with NSC@@ LC is adjusted to benefit from D@@ ox@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( n = 172 , 6.2 versus 7.4 months , adjusted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0,0@@ 18 ) .
limited data of a separate randomised , controlled Phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression free survival ) for P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) are similar to doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
the efficacy analy@@ tics of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the ITT population and support the non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AL@@ IM@@ TA C@@ is@@ plat@@ in combination opposite the gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ plat@@ in combination .
median PFS was 4.8 months for the combination of AL@@ IM@@ TA C@@ is@@ plat@@ in ( adjusted HR = 1.@@ 04 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 94 - 1.@@ 15 ) , the overall response rate was 30.@@ 6 % ( 95 % CI = 27,@@ 0 - 3@@ 1.4 ) for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ plat@@ in .

it is applied in overweight adults with a body mass index ( Body Mass Index - BMI ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in combination with low cal@@ orie , low @-@ fat diet .
patients receiving all@@ i may take no weight loss after 12 weeks should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if this enzy@@ mes s@@ war@@ med , they can not build some fats in food , thereby creating about a quarter of the fats that in@@ corrup@@ ted the intest@@ ines .
in a third study it was compared to 391 overweight patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo .
in both studies in patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2 we had patients who recorded a total weight loss of 4.8 kg compared to a year , compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo .
in the study involving all@@ i in patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , could not be observed for the patients &apos;s relevant weight loss .
the most common adverse events of all@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily spots on after , fle@@ atus ( winch ) with chair , chair oil , fet@@ al / o@@ ily chair , departure of sec@@ ures ( feet ) , Flat@@ ul@@ ence ( winch ) and soft chairs .
it may not be applied to patients with Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( for preventing the organ of transplan@@ tation ) or with drugs such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may not be applied to patients who suffer from a long @-@ term impact syndrome ( which do not suffer enough nutrients from the digest@@ ive tract ) or to cholesterol ( a liver disease ) , and at pregnant or breast cancer .
in July 2007 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited approval for placing the placing of Or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K throughout the European Union .
all@@ i is inde@@ xed to weight loss of adults with overweight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a hypo@@ allergi@@ en@@ ic , fet@@ al induced diet .
all@@ i may not be applied to children and young people under 18 , because there are no sufficient data available for efficacy and safety .
however , Or@@ list@@ at only is minim@@ ally res@@ or@@ ously , is necessary for elderly and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function .
• Over@@ sensitivity to the substance or one of the other components • Excellent treatment with Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see Section 4.6 ) • Working time ( see Section 4.6 ) • Stop treatment with War@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see sections 4.5 and 4.8 )
the probability of recur@@ ring gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a low @-@ fat single meal or low @-@ fat diet .
as the weight reduction can be used in diabetes with improved met@@ abolic control , patients who consult a drug with all@@ i before the start of therapy with all@@ i to consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist , because the dosage of anti @-@ diabet@@ ic activity must be adapted .
patients receiving all@@ i as well as pharmac@@ euticals against hyper@@ tension or an increased cholesterol level , should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist whether the dosage must be adjusted to this medicine .
it is recommended to meet additional fluctu@@ ating measures in order to prevent liability of severe di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea in the case of severe di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( see Section 4.5 ) .
both in a study on interaction effects of medicines as well as in several cases with simultaneous application of or@@ list@@ at and Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in was observed a lowering of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ ine Plas@@ m@@ asp@@ que .
when the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at could affect the Quick values ( international normal@@ ized ratio , IN@@ R ) ( see section 4.8 ) .
in most patients who were treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years with or@@ list@@ at , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as the beta carot@@ enes are treated .
however , the patients should be recommended to ensure a supplem@@ entary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement to ensure a sufficient vit@@ amine intake ( see section 4.4 ) .
after the gift of one single dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on was observed with a limited number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time , a lower decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on plasma concentration .
animal experimental studies show no direct or indirect adverse impacts on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the effects of Or@@ list@@ at are mainly gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal nature and depend on pharmac@@ ological effects of the pharmaceutical , as the absorption of recorded fat is prevented .
the gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally easy and temporary .
the Frequ@@ encies are defined as follows : very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) , rarely ( frequency 1 / 1,000 ) and very rarely ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data is not estimated ) .
the pre@@ valence of these adverse events that were found after the market launch of Or@@ list@@ at , is not known as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of a certain population .
† It is pl@@ au@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to potential or actual gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days to normal and overweight subjects without having significant clinical findings .
during the majority of the cases reported by Or@@ list@@ at @-@ Over@@ do@@ zation , no side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on humans and animal , from a fast re@@ formation of any system@@ ic effects , which can be attributed to the li@@ pas@@ ter properties of or@@ list@@ at .
the therapeutic effect occurs in the l@@ umen of Mag@@ ens and the upper small int@@ estine through cov@@ al@@ ent li@@ aison to the active Ser@@ in @-@ rest of the gast@@ ric and pan@@ cre@@ atic Li@@ pas@@ en .
clinical trials was derived that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at is taken three times daily , the absorption of approximately 25 % of the diet .
two double blind , randomised , placebo @-@ controlled studies on adults with a BMI of 28 kg / m2 on the effectiveness of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times daily in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ ine , fet@@ al induced diet .
the primary parameters , the alter@@ ation of the body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ isation ) , was as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as part of those student body , which have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies , the greatest weight loss happened during the first 6 months .
the average change in total cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( output value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mol / l ) and placebo + 2.8 % ( output value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mol / l ) .
the average change of the LD@@ L cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( output value 3.@@ 30 m@@ mol / l ) and placebo + 3.8 % ( output value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mol / l ) .
for the wa@@ ist circumference , the average change is -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( output value 10@@ 3.7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3,6 cm ( output value 10@@ 3,5 cm ) .
plasma concentration of non met@@ abolic or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ ur@@ able 8 hours after the oral gift of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
7 In general , non @-@ met@@ abolic or@@ list@@ at in plasma was only spor@@ adi@@ cally and extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.001 µ@@ mol ) and without signs of a cum@@ ulation .
in a study with adi@@ p@@ ous patients who was given minimum system@@ ically res@@ or@@ ated dose , namely M1 ( in position 4 hy@@ d@@ rol@@ y@@ zed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after folding of the N @-@ form@@ yl @-@ leu@@ c@@ ine group ) , identified approximately 42 % of total pl@@ as@@ ma@@ concentrations .

Alo@@ xi is applied on chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( such as C@@ is@@ plat@@ in ) , as well as chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies , the moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , D@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or Car@@ b@@ op@@ lat@@ in ) .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by an additional administration of a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medic@@ inal product that can be used as anti@@ emet@@ ry ) .
the application for patients under 18 years is not recommended , as to the effects in this age group is not enough information .
this means that the substance has the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
Alo@@ xi was investigated in three main studies on 1 8@@ 42 adult , chemical therap@@ ies , which are strong and moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting .
in chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi in the 24 hours after chemotherapy was no vom@@ iting ( 132 out of 223 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron patients ( 126 from 221 ) .
for chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies , the moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi in the 24 hours after chemotherapy was no vom@@ iting ( 153 of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron patients ( 127 of 185 ) .
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values are 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission granted Helsinki branch Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . a approval for the placing of Alo@@ e in the entire European Union .
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : to prevention of acute nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in heavily em@@ eto@@ gen@@ ic chemotherapy due to a cancer @-@ disease and vom@@ iting with moderate chemotherapy due to a cancer disease .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ e to prevention of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , which is induced by a strong in@@ eto@@ gen@@ ic chemotherapy , can be increased by adding a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids in front of chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the col@@ o@@ int surgery , patients should be monitored by an am@@ nesty decre@@ asing or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us after injection .
like with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ agon@@ ists , however , caution was charged with the benefit of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with pharmac@@ euticals , which extends the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ T@@ - interval is extended or those that tend to such an extension .
except in connection with another chem@@ o@@ therapeu@@ tics gift , Alo@@ xi is supposed to be used in the days after chemotherapy nor to the treatment of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting .
in pre@@ clinical studies of inhibit@@ ors Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron identified the activity of the five examined chem@@ o@@ therapeu@@ tics ( C@@ is@@ plat@@ in , Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , Cy@@ clo@@ ab@@ in , D@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ yc@@ in C ) .
in a clinical study no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic interaction among a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a ste@@ ady concentration of Met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ am@@ ids , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
in one of a population based pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic analysis showed that the simultaneous administration of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ inhibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on , C@@ elec@@ oxi@@ b , ox@@ et@@ ine , ox@@ et@@ ine , sp@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , sp@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , ra@@ zed , ser@@ tr@@ al@@ ine and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience to use Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies occur not , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied at fluctu@@ ations , unless it is necessary to be deemed necessary by the treat doctor .
in clinical trials , the most common dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which at least could be related to Alo@@ e at least , head@@ aches , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and al@@ ar@@ ising ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity re@@ actions and reactions at the administration site ( Bur@@ ning , har@@ dening , complaints and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experience .
in the group with the highest dosage , similar Frequ@@ encies of adverse events showed in the other dosage groups ; there were no dose action relations .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were performed , but due to the large distribution volume , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not effective treatment with an Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dosage .
in two randomised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients / m2 C@@ is@@ plat@@ in , Car@@ b@@ op@@ lat@@ in , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 , placebo and 250 mcg / m2 of cy@@ an@@ os@@ et@@ ron were treated with patients who received 32 mg On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time period 7.3 hours ) , which was given at day 1 without D@@ ange@@ eth@@ as@@ one intraven@@ ously .
in a randomised double @-@ blind study , 667 patients who received a strong em@@ eto@@ gen@@ ic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ b@@ az@@ in as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , were compared to patients who received 32 mg of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron who received 1 intraven@@ ous day .
results of studies with moderate chemotherapy and the study with strong em@@ eto@@ gen@@ ic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables .
in clinical trials investig@@ ating chemotherapy induced nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were similar to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters , including the respective effects of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
after the findings of clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the I@@ on@@ ary channels in the vent@@ ric@@ ular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation to extend the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study carried out at 221 healthy volunteers were the assessment of the EC@@ G @-@ effects of i.@@ v. of cl@@ ung Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.25 , 0.75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
res@@ or@@ ption For intraven@@ ous gift follows an initial decrease of the plasma concentration of a slow elim@@ ination from the body with an average terminal half @-@ duration of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ately in the entire dose range of 0,@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg .
according to the intraven@@ ous gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the average ( ± SD ) increase in Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34 % .
from pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics sim@@ ulations , that at once daily intraven@@ ous gift of 0.25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in 3 consecutive days reached total exposition ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) which was comparable to an intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous administration of 0.75 mg ; however , the C@@ max was higher after the set of 0.75 mg higher .
about 40 % of the kidneys were eliminated , and another 50 % are eliminated in two primary metabol@@ ites compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in less than 1 % of the ant@@ agon@@ ist effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in vitro studies for Met@@ abol@@ ism , CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 has been involved in the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elim@@ ination following an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found approximately 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in ur@@ ine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an un@@ altered substance made approximately 40 % of the given dose .
after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous Bol@@ us@@ in@@ ski injection , the total body @-@ rate 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al cle@@ aring was 53 ± 29 ml / min .
although patients with severe liver function dis@@ rup@@ tions the terminal elim@@ ination time and the average system@@ ic exposure of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases , a reduction in the dose is however not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions that are considered adequate for the maximum human therapeutic exposure , which indicates a low relev@@ ance for clinical use .
10 From pre@@ clinical trials stated that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can block only in very high concentrations of I@@ on@@ ary channels , which can be involved in the vent@@ ric@@ ular de@@ - and repe@@ al period .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose ent@@ ree in about the 30@@ fold of the therapeutic exposure of people ) , carried out daily over two years , led to an increased frequency of liver tum@@ ors , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ op@@ las@@ men ( in thy@@ ro@@ id , p@@ itu@@ itary , pan@@ cre@@ as , an@@ ni@@ er@@ en@@ mark ) and skin cancer in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the used high doses and da Alo@@ xi is determined for one @-@ time application , the relev@@ ance of this results will be a low for human beings .

June 2006 , the Committee on Human Nutrition Agency ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report in which the pro@@ hibit@@ ing of approval for the treatment of hepatitis C is recommended for the treatment of hepatitis C for the treatment of Alph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
this means that Alph@@ eon should be similar to Ro@@ feron @-@ A with the same practices ne@@ il@@ i effective part , which is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; Reference Sub@@ stances &quot; ) .
Alph@@ eon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( one by virus infection ) .
a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic investigation shows the liver tissue damage , and the values of the liver enzyme Al@@ an@@ in@@ - amin@@ ot@@ rans@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) is increased in the blood .
it is produced by a yeast into which a gene ( DNA ) was transferred to the formation of action .
the manufacturer of Alph@@ eon presented data to the comparison of Alph@@ eon with Ro@@ feron @-@ A ( active structure , composition and purity of the medication , effects , safety and efficacy of hepatitis C ) .
in the study on patients with hepatitis C , the efficacy of Alph@@ eon was compared to 455 patients .
the study was measured as many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks as well as 6 months after adjusting the treatment to the drug ( i.e. no signs of the virus referred to in the blood ) .

in addition , concerns relating to the stability of the drug and the pharmaceutical products were not suff@@ iciently explained .
the number of patients with hepatitis C that talked to the treatment with Alph@@ eon and Ro@@ feron @-@ A was similar in clinical study .
after setting the treatment with Alph@@ eon , the disease has increased again in more than with regard to the reference rate ; in addition , Alph@@ eon had more side effects .
apart from that , the test was included in the study to evaluate a immune response ( i.e. the body is antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) , not adequate .
it can be used for the treatment of Imp@@ et@@ igo ( one with a cr@@ ushing formation of skin infection ) and small in@@ infected Laz@@ er@@ ations ( R@@ iss@@ or chi@@ ves ) , sh@@ ading and se@@ duc@@ ed wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go is not used to treat infections , which were det@@ ectable or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RSA ) because Alar@@ go against this type of infections may not be avoided .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years may not exceed 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not respond to the treatment two to three days , the doctor should re@@ examine the patient further examination and alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of bacteria cell where proteins are produced ) and in@@ hib@@ its the growth of bacteria .
the main Indi@@ c@@ ator of the efficacy was in all five studies of the patients whose infection was denied after the end of treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients were treated with placebo .
in the treatment of infected skin wounds , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in similar to response : when the results were taken together with skin wounds , about 90 % of both groups were treated for the treatment .
however , in these two trials , however , Al@@ tar@@ go was found in the treatment of wast@@ es ( failed cav@@ ity in body tissue ) or of infections , which were det@@ ectable or probably caused by M@@ RSA , not effective enough .
the most common side effect with alt@@ ar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation of the order .
the E@@ tar@@ go ( CH@@ MP ) Committee became the conclusion that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go is in short @-@ time treatment of the subsequent surface treatment of the following super@@ ficial skin attacks against the risks : • Imp@@ et@@ igo , • infected small in@@ sights , elim@@ in@@ able or inclined wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd . an approval for the placing of Al@@ tar@@ go in the entire European Union .
the patients , in which there is no improvement in cases within two to three days , should not be considered once and an alternative therapy is considered ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in the case of sen@@ si@@ zing or heavy local Ir@@ rit@@ ation through the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment should be carefully wi@@ ped and an adequate alternative therapy of the infection began .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not to be applied to the treatment of infections , for which M@@ RSA is known as path@@ ogen is known or assumed ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical studies , the efficacy of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections , which were caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant st@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RSA ) , in@@ sufficient .
an alternative therapy is considered to be considered if after 2 to 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected place occurs .
the effect of simultaneous use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical means on the same skin area is not examined and the simultaneous use of other top@@ ical medicines is not recommended .
due to the low plasma concentration , which were achieved in people after top@@ ical use on sh@@ ielded skin or infected super@@ ficial wounds , a clinical @-@ relevant in@@ hibition could not be expected in vivo ( see section 5.2 ) .
3 After a continuous gift of 2 times daily 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol , the mean Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max according to top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be fell to the poor skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the low system@@ ic exposure of top@@ ical application in patients , dose adjustments cannot be kept necessary when top@@ ical Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during a system@@ ic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a re@@ productive medicine after oral intake and are in@@ adequate in relation to a statement on the birth and the f@@ öt@@ t@@ ale / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be applied during pregnancy , if a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clear , and the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able in an system@@ ic anti@@ bi@@ otic treatment .
in case of decision whether the breast@@ feeding is continued / terminated or the therapy with alt@@ ar@@ go is expected to be completed between the benefit of a stand@@ still for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical studies in 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go had applied , the most frequently reported side effects of Ir@@ rit@@ ation at the administration of the administration , which concerned about 1 % of patients .

the action mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis on interaction in a certain binding point in the 50s sub@@ unit of the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ om , which differs from the ashes of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ anti@@ bacterial substances .
data show that the bonds of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales protein L3 is involved in the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding point and the Pep@@ tide transferred centre .

in case of the local pre@@ valence of the resistance of the resistor value of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some inf@@ ectious forms should appear , an advice should be targeted by experts .
there were no differences in in @-@ vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in the case of a failure to treat the treatment in S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .

Am@@ bi@@ rix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases related to liver ) in children between one and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases .
Am@@ bi@@ rix is applied in the context of one from two doses existing , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may be achieved only after administration of the second dose .
for this reason , Am@@ bi@@ rix may only be used when the immun@@ isation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection , and ensured that the vacc@@ ination plan can be led out of two doses .
if a ref@@ res@@ h dose against hepatitis A or B is preferred , Am@@ bi@@ rix or other hepatitis A@@ - or -@@ B vaccine will be given .
vacc@@ ines work by stim@@ ulating the immune system ( the natural Ab@@ le of the body ) , &quot; as it can defend itself against a disease .
once a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recogni@@ zes the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; foreign &quot; and produces antibodies against it .
Am@@ bi@@ rix includes the same components as the vaccine Twin@@ rix Children since 1996 and the vaccine Twin@@ rix Children since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are being applied to the protection against the same diseases , however , Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ults and Twin@@ rix Children administered in the context of one from three doses existing .
because Am@@ bi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that supports the application of Twin@@ rix adults , also used as a cover for the application of Am@@ bi@@ rix .
the main Indi@@ c@@ ator for the effectiveness was the proportion of im@@ min@@ ated children , which had developed a protective anti @-@ physical concentration after the last injection .
in an additional study with 208 children , the efficacy of the vaccine is compared to a six @-@ month and a 12 month distance between the two inj@@ ections .
am@@ bi@@ rix introduced a month after the final injection of the antibody against hepatitis A and B between 98 % and 100 % of the vacc@@ ination .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Am@@ bi@@ rix was similar to a six @-@ month distance between the inj@@ ections was similar .
the most common adverse events of Am@@ bi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses ) are head@@ ache , appet@@ ite , pain on injection point , red@@ ness , matrix ( fatigue ) as well as friction .
Am@@ bi@@ rix may not react to the molecular entities ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other parts or Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an anti@@ bi@@ otic ) .
in August 2002 the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ etic . an approval of the placing of Am@@ bi@@ rix in the entire
the Stand@@ ar@@ dim@@ ti@@ met@@ able for the Grun@@ dim@@ entation with Am@@ bi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , whereby the first dose is given at the date of choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a table runs for hepatitis A as well as for hepatitis B , it can be vacc@@ inated with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or with a combination of combination .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B anti @-@ hepatitis ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) anti @-@ hepatitis B anti @-@ hepatitis ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) anti @-@ hepatitis B anti @-@ hepatitis ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) anti@@ ch@@ ment values are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not fully secured whether immun@@ ity persons who have been addressed to an hepatitis @-@ A@@ - vacc@@ ination , since they possibly have no longer det@@ ectable anti @-@ antibodies by the immune memory .
3 As all inj@@ ures are required for the rare case of an@@ aph@@ yl@@ ac@@ tic reaction , according to the gift of the vacc@@ ination of vacc@@ ination and monitoring will always be available immediately .
if a faster protection against hepatitis B is needed , the standard dim@@ pl@@ scheme is recommended , the 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface is recommended .
in case of hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the immune system , an anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibody being achieved , so in these cases the gift of further vacc@@ ines may be required .
since an intra@@ ocular injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration could lead to the glut@@ eal muscles , these inj@@ ections should be avoided .
according to Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ t@@ open@@ ia or blood disorders , Am@@ bi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected as an exception , as it can come to in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration in these cases .
when Am@@ bi@@ rix was administered in the form of a separate injection , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ular Per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , activated poli@@ omyel@@ itis , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ itis , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ itis , or Ha@@ em@@ oph@@ ilus , was the immune response to all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients under immun@@ om@@ res@@ sive therapy or patients with immune defects must be assumed that no sufficient immune response is achieved .
in a clinical study that has been carried out with 3 vacc@@ ines of these form@@ ulations in adults , the frequency of pain , red@@ ness , sw@@ elling , head@@ ache , head@@ ache , head@@ ache , head@@ ache , head@@ ache , head@@ ache and preserv@@ ative vaccine form@@ ulating was observed .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines Am@@ bi@@ rix were administered at a total of 10@@ 27 im@@ pregn@@ ation at the age of 1 to 15 years .
in a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 and including 15 years , the toler@@ ability of Am@@ bi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ doses @-@ combined transport material .
only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and matrix on a calculation basis per vacc@@ ination of Am@@ bi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the administration of Am@@ bi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.7 % of the subjects compared with 3@@ 9.1 % in the test according to the gift of a dose of 3 doses .
according to the complete vacc@@ ination cycle we reported 6@@ 6.4 % of the subjects who had given Am@@ bi@@ rix were vacc@@ inated over pain , compared with 6@@ 3.8 % of the subjects who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose .
however , the frequency of Matcha was comparable to a subject ( i.e. about the total vacc@@ ination cycle at 3@@ 9,6 % of the subjects , which received Am@@ bi@@ rix , compared with 3@@ 6.2 % in the subjects who received the 3 @-@ doses @-@ compound .
the pre@@ valence of distinct pain and matter was small and comparable , which was observed after administration of the combination @-@ material with the 3 @-@ doses @-@ vacc@@ ination .
in a comparison study with 1 to 11 years of im@@ fl@@ atten@@ s , the occurr@@ ence of local re@@ actions and general actions was comparable to the am@@ bi@@ kin@@ i group with 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
however , for the 6 to 11@@ - year old , however , after vacc@@ ination with Am@@ bi@@ rix , a frequency of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per subject , reported .
the share of im@@ fl@@ ore , who reported over heavy side effects during the 2 @-@ cans vacc@@ ines with 360 EL@@ ISA@@ - units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated Hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B , was statistically significant not different .
in clinical studies that were carried out with Imp@@ air@@ rings at the age of 1 to 15 years were the serum @-@ conversion rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9.1 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second , to the month 6 ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the serum conversion rates for anti @-@ H@@ BS were 7@@ 4.2 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second , to the month 6 ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study , which was carried out at 12- to including 15 @-@ year @-@ old , received 142 two cans of Am@@ bi@@ rix and 147 the standard combinations with three doses .
in the 289 persons whose immun@@ ity was valuable , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ance rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher than associated with Am@@ bi@@ rix , in the table below 2 and 6 .
the immune response in a clinical comparison study was reached in 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ old one month after the completion of the full vaccine series ( i.e. , in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies the im@@ min@@ ers received either a 2 @-@ cans vacc@@ ination with Am@@ bi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses @-@ vacc@@ ination with 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10@@ µg of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in persons who were aged 12 to 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies took over at least 24 months after immun@@ isation with am@@ bi@@ rix which can be detected in the 0 @-@ 6 months vaccine .
this study observed immun@@ ologic reaction against both anti@@ gens was comparable to vacc@@ ination with a combination of 360 ELISA units , consisting of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated H@@ epat@@ it@@ is@@ - A @-@ virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study in 12- to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies are comparable 24 months after immun@@ isation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vaccine is comparable to that in the 0 @-@ 12 months vaccine .
when the first dose of Am@@ bi@@ rix was administered at the same time with the collection of a combined di@@ ph@@ ic , tet@@ an@@ us@@ o@@ rem , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ itis and 8 Ha@@ em@@ oph@@ ilus ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) , or with the first dose of a combined mas@@ ons m@@ um@@ ps vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens .
a clinical study carried out with 3 doses of current formulation in adults showed the current formulation of similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ors and serum conversion rates as for the former formulation .
the vaccine is reflected in both eyes and / or physical changes by eye @-@ pen@@ dic@@ ular particles and / or physical changes .
in accordance with Article 114 of Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , the state @-@ based batch conversion is carried out by a state laboratory or an authorised laboratory for this purpose .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transferred by vir@@ al food@@ stuffs and beverage , but can also be transmitted by other ways , such as through Baden in water pur@@ ified waters .
you can feel very tired , have a dark ur@@ ine , a fl@@ aming face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms possibly make a stationary treatment .
as with all vacc@@ ines Am@@ bi@@ rix can not protect themselves from an infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vaccine series has been completed with 2 doses .
if you are infected with Hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus ( although you have not been infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus ( although you still feel un@@ likely or feel sick / feel ) may not prevent vacc@@ ination .
a protection against other infections which cause the liver damage or symptoms which are similar to those of hepatitis B infection , cannot be convey@@ ed .
• when using you / your child you have an allergic reaction to Am@@ bi@@ rix or any component of this vaccine including Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an anti@@ bi@@ otic ) .
an allergic reaction can be ign@@ ited by ju@@ ck@@ ating skin attacks , respir@@ atory skin or gu@@ ardi@@ ans . • if you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B only if you have a severe infection with a fever or a fever .
• if you want to have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the dosing of the second vacc@@ ination ) .
with a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with am@@ bi@@ rix .
instead , he will recommend 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of hepatitis B ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) .
the second vacc@@ ination of this vaccine with reduced content is administered in one month after the first dose and should give you a vacc@@ ination against the vaccine series at the end of the vacc@@ ination .
sometimes Am@@ bi@@ rix is inj@@ ected in persons who are inj@@ ected to severe ble@@ eding disorders if you are weak@@ ened / or if your child is weak@@ ened in their own immune defence / or if you under@@ go / her child into a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis .
Am@@ bi@@ rix can be given in these cases but the immune response of these persons can be not sufficient for vacc@@ ination , so that a blood test can be needed to see how strongly the reaction is on vacc@@ ination .
21 S@@ ages your doctor if you receive / your child any further medicine ( including those who have been vacc@@ inated without dis@@ appearance ) or if you have given / your child recently been vacc@@ inated / received or Immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine ( antibodies ) or has been planned in the near future .
but it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine must be given simultaneously with Am@@ bi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated in separate areas and possible different li@@ mb@@ s .
if Am@@ bi@@ rix should be given at the same time or shortly before or after injection of Immun@@ og@@ lob@@ bies , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be adequate .
usually Am@@ bi@@ rix pregnant or l@@ act@@ ating women are not given , except it is ur@@ gently required to be vacc@@ inated with hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B .
important Information about certain other features of Am@@ bi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( anti@@ bi@@ otic ) in case of you / your child .
if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , please talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible .

Am@@ bi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
based on the data , which has become known since the approval of the first approval for placing on the market , the CH@@ MP grants positive opinion that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Am@@ bi@@ rix remains positive .
since Am@@ bi@@ rix was installed only in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security data for this medicine is limited to small patient exposition .
Ammon@@ ites can also be used at the age of over a month with in@@ complem@@ entary enzy@@ mes or with hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ic En@@ cep@@ halopath@@ y ( brain damage due to high am@@ mon@@ ium concentration ) in its history .
Ammon@@ ites is administered - split by several single doses ( meals ) , mixed by food or via a Gast@@ rust@@ om@@ ial ( through the abdom@@ inal to the stomach &apos;s leading hose ) or a no@@ bl@@ onde ( due to the nose into the stomach &apos;s leading hose ) .
this was not a comparative study because the children of Ammon could not be compared to any other treatment or placebo ( a drug medicine , i.e. without active ingredient ) .
Ammon@@ ites can also lead to appet@@ ite , a abnormal acidity , scal@@ ability , head@@ ache , head@@ ache , flav@@ ours , flav@@ ours , flav@@ ours , nau@@ sea , const@@ ip@@ ation , skin r@@ ash or weight gain .
the EU Committee on Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) came to conclu@@ de that Ammon@@ ites were effectively prevented in patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the ur@@ inary cycle .
Ammon@@ ites was approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; because of the rarity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information about this medicine .
the use is inde@@ xed in all patients with a complete enzyme ( within the first 28 life days ) .
in patients with a late @-@ mani@@ fold form ( un@@ complete enzyme , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first life of life ) , there is an indication for use when in the history of a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ic En@@ cep@@ halopath@@ y .
for babies , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with s@@ u@@ cking disorders is AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS also available in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form .
the daily dose may be calculated individually for the protein tolerance and the development of daily intake of the patients .
according to the previous clinical experiences the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg .
patients who suffer from an early mani@@ fold defic@@ iency of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosphate or Or@@ ni@@ th@@ in@@ tran@@ sponder bam@@ yl@@ ase , is necessary to be subst@@ itution of Cit@@ y@@ lin or arg@@ in@@ ine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
patients with ar@@ arg@@ in@@ os@@ uc@@ cin@@ oma defic@@ iency need to preserve arg@@ in@@ ine in a dosage of 0,4 @-@ 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15,@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with stro@@ kes , as a risk for the emergence of Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , if the tablets do not reach immediately in the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mol ) sodium , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , equivalent to the maximum daily dose .
therefore , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be applied with con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure or severe cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency as well as with sodium re@@ sign@@ ation and oil formation only with caution .
since Met@@ abol@@ ism and de@@ position of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is carried out over the liver and the kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be applied with liver or kidney failure , only with the first caution .
the importance of these results in terms of pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore con@@ tra @-@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous util@@ isation of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ acet@@ ate to young rats at a high dosage ( 190 - 474 mg / kg ) , it came to a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal deteri@@ oration and an increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed matur@@ ation of her@@ eb@@ r@@ als syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of working nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of the brain growth .
it could not be noted whether phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ acet@@ ate is eliminated when humans in the breast milk is avoided , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is con@@ tra @-@ inde@@ xed during the stand@@ time ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , at least 56 % of patients showed at least one un@@ wanted event ( AE ) and 78 % of these un@@ wanted events were assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old ano@@ dis@@ kt@@ atic patient , which developed a met@@ abolic En@@ cep@@ halopath@@ y in conjunction with Lak@@ ut@@ azi@@ r , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , P@@ anz@@ yt@@ open@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y and pan@@ cre@@ at@@ itis .
a case of an over@@ dosage occurred with a 5 month old little child with an acci@@ dental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms proceed with the accum@@ ulation of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ acet@@ ate , which showed an intraven@@ ous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day a dos@@ sier of neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ abolic active compound , which is con@@ jug@@ ated by acet@@ yl@@ ate glut@@ amine in glut@@ amine glut@@ amine by the kidneys .
St@@ ö@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to urea ( both coupl@@ ings contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as a alternative carrier for de@@ position of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed to be produced for each gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat between 0.12 and 0.15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is of importance that the diagnosis is early , and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival opportunities and clinical outcome .
the progn@@ osis of the early @-@ shaped form of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was formerly almost always inf@@ ant , and the disease was in treating treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al@@ di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their st@@ ick@@ ed free anal@@ ysts within the first year of life .
by hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis , the util@@ isation of alternative ways of nit@@ ric de@@ position ( So@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , prot@@ ein@@ y K@@ ost and possibly subst@@ itution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate in post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first of life ) diagnosed diseases to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients the survival rate was with many as many as mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ ien@@ cies .
patients with a late @-@ shaped form of the disease ( including female patients with hetero@@ zy@@ got@@ es form of the Or@@ ni@@ th@@ in@@ tran@@ sponder bam@@ yl@@ ase @-@ Man@@ gels ) , which were treated by a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ic En@@ cep@@ halopath@@ y form and treated permanently with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and a protective reduction diet was 98 % .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ si@@ bly in treatment and with some patients a further deteri@@ oration of neuro@@ logic function can occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ al is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate , which is con@@ jug@@ ated in the liver and kidneys with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its Met@@ abol@@ ites in plasma and ur@@ ine were determined according to the gift of a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in so@@ res healthy adults and patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which was determined as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( non @-@ controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabolism was also studied in cancer patients with intraven@@ ous gift of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in tablet form , 15 minutes after taking meas@@ ur@@ able plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were determined .
in the majority of patients suffering from ur@@ inary cycles or hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ s ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) on the next morning , no phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate was det@@ ectable in plasma .
in three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the medium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in Plas@@ m@@ asp@@ que were five times higher than after the first gifts .
the medication is extracted within 24 hours to about 80 @-@ 100 % of the con@@ jug@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ ate glut@@ amine by the kidneys .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat had no cl@@ ast@@ ogenic effects ( investigation 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is either or@@ ally taken ( inf@@ ant and children who can &apos;t swal@@ low tablets , or patients with stro@@ kes ) or via a rust@@ proof dish or a no@@ bl@@ onde .
according to the previous clinical experiences the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg .
the concentration of ammonia , arg@@ in@@ ine , essential amino acids ( in particular bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in plasma should be kept within the normal range .
patients who suffer from an early mani@@ fold defic@@ iency of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosphate or Or@@ ni@@ th@@ in@@ tran@@ sponder bam@@ yl@@ ase , is necessary to be subst@@ itution of Cit@@ y@@ lin or arg@@ in@@ ine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5.4 m@@ mol ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , equivalent to the maximum daily dose .
when R@@ atten@@ d@@ les were exposed to the birth phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ acet@@ ate ( active met@@ e@@ lit by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , there came to les@@ ions in the pyramid of the cran@@ ial container .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old ano@@ dis@@ kt@@ atic patient , which developed a met@@ abolic En@@ cep@@ halopath@@ y in conjunction with Lak@@ ut@@ azi@@ r , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , P@@ anz@@ yt@@ open@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y and pan@@ cre@@ at@@ itis .
St@@ ö@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to urea ( both coupl@@ ings contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as a alternative carrier to eradi@@ cation of excess
on the basis of investigations on the exp@@ ulsion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed that for each gram , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can be produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible in treatment , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of neuro@@ logical state may occur .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form , 15 minutes after taking meas@@ ur@@ able plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were determined .
during the duration of the durability , the patient can use the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C .
with this approach , the small measuring spoon 0.@@ 95 g , the average measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon of 8.6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
if a patient needs to obtain the medicine via a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ u@@ bility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat amounts up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzy@@ mes are missing , so that they can not ex@@ crete to consumption of proteins in the body .
if the laboratory tests are carried out , you must tell the doctor that you may take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat may affect the results of certain laboratory studies .
when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines , or recently , even if it is not prescribed for pres@@ cription medic@@ inal products .
during a stand@@ still time , you cannot take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as the medicine could be over@@ flowing with your baby .
in rare cases , tur@@ bul@@ ence , head@@ ache , flav@@ ours , vari@@ ability , disin@@ ter@@ ity , memory disorders and deteri@@ oration of existing neuro@@ logical states were observed .
if you notice one of these symptoms , you immediately put yourself with your doctor or with the emergency absorption of your hospital for introduction of an appropriate treatment in connection .

an@@ gi@@ ox is applied for the treatment of adult patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ age synthesis ( ACS , reduced blood vessels ( a form of pain in the chest basket with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( cardi@@ ac disease ) without &quot; ST@@ - Heb@@ ung &quot; ( a anom@@ al@@ ous measurement value at the electro@@ cardi@@ ograph or EK@@ G ) .
angi@@ ox@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients receiving one PCI , a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
in patients with ang@@ ina or cardi@@ ac arr@@ he@@ a , this can contribute to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS at all with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI ) which was compared with conventional combination treatment with H@@ ep@@ arin ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ) and a G@@ PI .
during the PCI , the patients frequently used a st@@ ent ( a short tube , which in the arter@@ ial remains to prevent a closure ) , and they received additional medicines for preventing blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and A@@ spir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS was an@@ gi@@ ox - with or without gift of G@@ PI - at preventing the new events ( deaths , heart failure or revol@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation ) after 30 days or a year in total as usual for conventional treatment .
in patients who under@@ go a PCI was an@@ gi@@ ox in terms of all indicators as well as H@@ ep@@ arin , except for severe ble@@ eding , where it was significantly more effective than H@@ ep@@ arin .
an@@ gi@@ ox may not be applied to patients , possibly over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , other mil@@ ud@@ ine or one of the other parts .
it also may not be applied to patients who had a blast of blood , as well as with a strong hyper@@ tension or severe kidney problems or a heart infection .
the Medic@@ ines Committee ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that angi@@ ox during the treatment of ACS and a PCI is an acceptable replacement for H@@ ep@@ arin .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the Company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd . an approval for the placing of an@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ de@@ dro@@ mes ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ Heb@@ rides ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) in case of an emergency case or when an early intervention is fore@@ seen .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is a intraven@@ ous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI option is carried out in a row , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be increased and the infusion for the duration of the intervention is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
after the PCI service requirements , the reduced infusion dose ranges from 0.25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately before the procedure , a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg is administered , followed by an infusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention .
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with one PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous bolt of 0.75 mg / kg of body weight and a subsequent intraven@@ ous infusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention .
the safety and efficacy of an all@@ ine Bol@@ us gift of angi@@ ox was not examined and is not recommended even when a short PCI intervention is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened under 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body@@ weight should be charged .
in order to reduce the appearance of lower ACT values , the re@@ constituted and diluted medicine was carefully mixed before application , and the Bol@@ us@@ dose rapidly administered intraven@@ ously .
once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly .
patients with moderate ren@@ al restriction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) which are subjected to one PCI ( whether with bi@@ valent ir@@ ud@@ in against ACS or not ) , a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT value is below 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is sufficient to increase the ACT 5 minutes after the second wr@@ ist dose .
in patients with moderate ren@@ al damage caused by the Phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , which were included in the approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the gift of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Bol@@ us with no dose adap@@ tion at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds .
3 For patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients , angi@@ ox is con@@ tra @-@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ ox can be re@@ directed 30 minutes after the end of the intraven@@ ous gift of un@@ fra@@ c@@ tion@@ ised h@@ ep@@ arin or 8 hours after finishing the sub@@ cut@@ aneous util@@ isation of Lower H@@ ep@@ arin .
• well @-@ known hyper@@ sensitivity against the active ingredient or other blood samples or against mil@@ ud@@ ine • active blood disorders due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of hem@@ og@@ as@@ es@@ ystems and / or ir@@ reversible stim@@ ul@@ ant disorders . • severe kidney failure ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of ble@@ eding , especially when Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) .
even when using PCI @-@ patients under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in most hem@@ or@@ tions of arter@@ ial pun@@ cture devices , patients who under@@ go out of a per@@ cut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ar@@ intervention ( PCI ) , during the treatment principle you may occur anywhere .
in patients treated with War@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , a monitoring of IN@@ R @-@ Wer@@ ts ( International normal@@ ized ratio ) should be considered to ensure that the value of treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in is again achieved in front of the treatment .
starting from the knowledge about the effects of anti @-@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( H@@ ep@@ arin , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ń@@ sk ) may be assumed that these substances may increase blood risk .
in combination of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in with Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tic aggreg@@ ates or anti @-@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants are the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ asis parameters in any case regularly .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used for treating adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes that require a treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) in the abdom@@ inal wall , inj@@ ected th@@ igh@@ s or upper arm with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not process sufficient insulin to control the gl@@ ucose level ( sugar ) in the blood or the insulin is not effective .
insulin p@@ is@@ ins distingu@@ ishes itself very mar@@ gin@@ ally of human insulin , and the change means that it works faster and shorter activity as a short @-@ term human insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra was used in combination with a long @-@ term insulin @-@ type insulin in combination with type 1 diabetes , where the body does not produce insulin , in two trials with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and included in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in case of type 2 diabetes , A@@ pi@@ dra has been investigated in a study with 8@@ 78 adults .
the main Indi@@ c@@ ator for the effectiveness was the change of the concentration of the substance gly@@ kos@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that shows how good blood sugar is set .
in the first study in adults with type 1 diabetes , a decrease of 0.14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) in comparison to a total lowering of 0.14 % at insulin p@@ is@@ an .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the decrease of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra in comparison to 0.@@ 30 % for human normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be applied to patients that are possibly over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against insulin @-@ insulin or one of the other parts , or in patients who suffer from hypo@@ glyc@@ emia .
the cans of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adjusted if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood @-@ gl@@ ucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ ent@@ is Deutschland GmbH to approval by A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is available as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the section of abdom@@ inal wall , or to apply or sub@@ cut@@ aneous to continuous infusion in the area of abdom@@ inal loading .
due to the reduced happiness capacity and reduced insulin delivery , the insulin demand may be reduced in patients with a limitation of liver function .
every change of active strength , the brand ( Her@@ - St@@ eller ) , the insulin ( normal , N@@ PH , zin@@ ge delay , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the production method can move a change in insulin demand .
3 A in@@ adequate dosage or breakdown of treatment , especially in patients with a insulin @-@ dependent diabetes , may lead to hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and diabet@@ ic k@@ eto@@ azi@@ r ; these states are potentially life @-@ threat@@ ening .
the change@@ over of one patient on another insulin type or insulin should be made under str@@ ingent medical supervision and may require a change of dosage .
the timing of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the efficiency profile of the used insulin . therefore , the change of treatment schem@@ es can therefore change .

heavy hypo@@ glyc@@ em@@ esis with consciousness can be treated by means of in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of gl@@ ucose ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is given by an intraven@@ ous person or treated by a doctor &apos;s intraven@@ ous gift .
after a gl@@ ucose monitoring , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the primary cause for the heavy hypo@@ glyc@@ emia and avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stim@@ ulating the peripheral gl@@ ucose ( particular by sk@@ el@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as the in@@ hibition of the gl@@ ucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous gain of insulin @-@ insulin @-@ effects occur faster and the duration of life is shorter than at hu@@ - man@@ em normal insulin .
in a study of 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes , insulin showed insulin @-@ relevant dosing range from 0,0@@ 75 to 0.15 E / kg , a proportional flow of glu@@ ing effects , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a proportional increase in glu@@ ing effects , exactly like human insulin .
insulin @-@ insulin has twice as fast effic@@ ien@@ cies as usual human insulin and achieves the full @-@ glu@@ ed effect of about 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
the data was evident that during a application of insulin inj@@ is@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before meal a comparable post @-@ postoperative glyc@@ em@@ ic control is achieved as with human normal levels , which is 30 minutes before meal .
if the insulin was charged 2 minutes before meal , insulin was performed better than with human normal levels , which was given 2 minutes before meal .
if insulin takes 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal , a comparable glyc@@ em@@ ic control is achieved as with human normal levels , which is given 2 mi@@ ths before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) .
