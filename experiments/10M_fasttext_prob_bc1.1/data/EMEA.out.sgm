<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European public assessment report (EPAR), in which explains how the Committee for Human-Compensation (CHMP) has performed the conducted studies in order to access recommendations concerning the application of medication.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need more information about your disease or treatment, please refer to the packet instructions (also part of the EPAR) or consult your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you require further information regarding the recommendations of the CHMP, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg melting tablet (tablets which dissolve in the mouth), as a solution for inserting (1 mg / ml) and as a injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. effective thinking and speaking, Hallucinations (hearing or view of things, which are not present), mistrust and madness; • bipolar-I disorder, a mental illness, in which patients have deficiency (periods of abnormal high spirits) alternately with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilled is used to treat medium to severe adverse episodes and preventative episodes of patients who have been in the past in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">Injection solution is applied for rapid control of increased unrest or behavioural troubles when the intake of the medicine is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">For both illnesses, the solution can be used for inserting or processed cheese in patients that make the swallow of tablets difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients, taking other medicines at the same time, the dose of Abilled should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs the signal transmission between brain cells by "neurotranitter," i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of the nerve cells.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole probably works as "partial Agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripipevamine like 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but in less measurements than the neural smitter effect to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine with schizophrenia and bipolar failure to play a role in Aripiprazole to normalize the activity of the brain, thereby reducing the psychotic or manic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of Abilisi, the restation of the symptoms, was investigated in three studies over up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared with 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases resulting in increased unrest, over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilled was compared to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study conducted the efficacy of Abilled and placebo which had already been stabilized on 160 patients, with which the manic symptoms had already been stabilized with Abilled.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilid injection solution was diagnosed in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder suffering from increased unrest, compared to Lorazepam (another antipsychotica) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change in patients were examined by a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also led studies to investigate how the body uses the melting tablet and the solution to remove resorously (up).</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with the injection solution, patients who received Abilisi in doses of 5.25 mg, 9,75 mg or 15 mg, a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms like patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the application for the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilled decreased in four of the five short-time studies of manic symptoms effective as placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition, Abilled was prevented for up to 74 weeks in more effective than placebo for re-perform episodes of previously treated patients and when it was also given to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Aspbilled injections in 10- or 15-mg doses have also been reduced effective as placebo which provoked unrest and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common adverse events of Abilisi (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients), headache (constant movement), headache (constant movement), scathic hypersecretion (increased memory production), fatigue and creation (increased memory production), redness and exhaustion, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">In contrast to the conclusion that the advantages of agronomy in the treatment of schizophrenia and medium-heavy-severe episodes of patients who had mainly manic episodes and with the preventative episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazole, opposed to the risks of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the Committee came to the result that the advantages of the injectors of disturbance and behavioural troubles in patients with schizophrenia or patients with manicophrenia or patients with manicophrenia is bipolar-I failure, when an oral therapy is not suitable.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. an approval for the placing on the market of Abilisi in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is responsible for the treatment of severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new deficiencies in patients, mainly manic episodes and their manic episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at a dose of 15 mg / day, regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">An increased effectiveness in doses above a daily dose of 15 mg was not detected, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">Efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar-I- disorder in patients ≥ 65 years was not detected.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initiation dose should be considered as clinical factors are justify (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from combination therapy, the Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behaviour belongs to psychotic diseases and affecting disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after change of an antipsychotic therapy, also in treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of a epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder, an elevated suicidal risk of Arijprazole was opposed to other antipsychotica compared to other antipsychotica.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be treated with care in patients with well-known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction), hercinogenic diseases, conditions which are prescribed for hypotonia (dehydration, Hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure sensitive drugs) or hypertension (including aczelerated and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Spätdyskinesia: in clinical trials, which was a year or less, there was occasional reports on treatment with Aripiprazole dysenting dyskinesis.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the patients treated with ABILIFY treated the signs and symptoms of a late dynasty, should be taken into consideration the dose should reduce or the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient undermark the signs and symptoms, which has to interpret a mns, or unclear fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotica must be removed, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore Aripiprazole should be used in patients with campas in the anamous or with condition that are used to be treated with caution.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years old with Aripiprazole in patients with psychosis which were associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazole, an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">There were however, in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between dosage and response to unwanted rovascular events with Aripiprazole patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoazivan or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients who were treated with atypical antipsychotic effects including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There is no excessive risk assessment for hyperglycemia related events with ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic effects of patients treated with direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polyphenols, polyphagie, and weakness, patients with diabetes mellitus, or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus, should be monitored regularly in regard to a deterioration of the glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain is generally used in schizophrens patients and patients with bipolar deficiencies due to comorbidities, the application of antipsychotics, in which weight gain as a side effects, and may lead to severe complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, it is charged if Aripiprazole is used in combination with alcohol or other centrally-effective drugs related side effects as sedation (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces resorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased the AUC of Aripiprazole by 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected to expect another highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6 such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, similar effects and therefore should be done similar dose reductions.</seg>
<seg id="52">In CYP2D6 'bad' (= "Poor") Metabolism can cause the joint application with high effective invertebrates of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentration of Aripiprazole in comparison to CYP2D6 extendable Metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you consider the common gift of ketoconazol or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential benefit should have potential risks for patients.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazol and HIV protease, have to be able to have similar effects and therefore should be done similar dose reductions.</seg>
<seg id="55">After placing the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors the dose of ABILIFY would be lifted to the Dosishist prior to the start of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Dileman or Escitalopram, or CYP2D6, together with ABILIFY, can be calculated with a constant increase of Aripipol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials, doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprayopia showed no significant effect on the metabolism of CYP2D6 (Dextromethorphan / 3-methodxymorphine ratio), 2C9 (Warbird), 2C19 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (Dextromethorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or pregnancy during the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the insufficient data of security in humans and due to the impairment of the animal, this drug may not be applied in pregnancy, unless the potential benefit is the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, in other antipsychotics the patients have been warned of warning, dangerous machines, including power vehicles, to operate, until they ensure that Aripiprazole has no negative influence on it.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medical-related side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the side effects listed below is defined by the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study about 52 weeks occurred in patients who were treated with Aripivole, a total of less incidence (25.8%) from EPS, including parcsonism, acathouse, Dystony and Dyskinesia compared to patients who were treated with Haloperidol (57,3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19% was treated in patients under Aripiprazole treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study of over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 14.8% was treated in patients treated with Aripipama and 15.1% in patients under Olanzapin therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes with bipolar-I-disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks was the incidence of EPS 23,5% in patients under Aripivol- treatment and 53.3% in patients under Haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study about 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients under Aripiprazole treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase, more than 26 weeks during a placebo-controlled study was the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients under Aripipol- treatment and 15.7% for placebo treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo which potentially clinically controlled laboratory parameters were detected, there was no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Enhancements of CPK (creatine phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of the patients with Aripipzole patients, compared to 2.0% of treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="71">Among the adverse events which may occur in connection with an antipsychotic treatment, the malignant neuroleptosis syndrome, speardyskinesis, and increased mortality rate of dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch have been unintentional, or deliberate overdossiations with an estimated doses of up to 1260 mg in adult patients with an estimated doses of up to 1260 mg.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there are no information about the effectiveness of a hematdialysis in the treatment of an overdosage with Aripiprazole; however, it is unlikely that hematalysis in the treatment of an overdosage value is because Aripiprazole has a high plasma cutting.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the effectiveness of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disturbance via the combination of a partial agonist effect on Dopamine D2- and Serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and a antagonist effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors is mediated.</seg>
<seg id="75">In vitro, Aripiprazole showed a high affinity to Dopamine D2- and D3-receptor as well as an incredible affinity to Dopamine D4-, to the serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1-adrinsane and for histamine-H1receptors.</seg>
<seg id="76">In the gift of Aripiprazole in dosages from 0,5 up to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks in healthy volunteers the Positans emissions reductions of 11C-Racloprid showed a D2 / D3-receptor, a D2 / D3-receptor, at the nucleus caudatus and on the Putt.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-time studies (4 to 6 weeks) at 1.228 schizophrens patients with positive or negative symptoms showed an statistically significant stronger improvement of psychotic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a half-controlled study, 52 of the proportion of patients who participated in study medication should be similar to study medication, in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measuring scales, which were defined as secondary study rates, including PANSS and Montgomery-Asgery scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than in Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study, more than 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia showed significantly higher reduction in response rate, which was 34% in the Aripiprazole group and 57% under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In a Olanzapin controlled, multinational double-blind study included in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, the 314 patients had decreased significantly less patients at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with a more flexible dose over 3 weeks with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I failure, Aripiprazole showed a placebo over placebo over 3 weeks in reducing clinical symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study about 3 weeks with fixed dosage of patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I failure, Aripiprazole showed no superior effectiveness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo- and active-controlled Monotherapy studies for 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychological characteristics, Aripiprazole showed a comparison to placebo over placebo in week 3 and a lasting effect, which was comparable to lithium or Haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In week Aripiprazole reported 12 a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania on like Lithium or Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study about 6 weeks with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I failure, with or without psychotic characteristics, which partially over 2 weeks did not reflect on lithium or Valproat-Monotherapy, the accompanying therapy associated with Aripipylbenzene found a superior effectiveness in the reduction of manic symptoms compared to Monotherapy with lithium or Valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study about 26 weeks, followed by a long-term expansion lasting more than 74 weeks before Randomisation during a stabilisation period before Randomisation revealed a remission compared to placebo in regard to the prevention of a bipolar return, mainly in the prevention of a retreat in the Manie.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the strain drifting and hydroxyredness of Aripiprazole, the N-Dealkyrie is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean elimination time is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazole in an extensive metabolic syndrome via CYP2D6 and for almost 146 hours at 'bad' (= "Poor") Metabolism over CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazole there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, as well as a pharmacokinetic investigation did not show gender-dependent patients.</seg>
<seg id="91">A pop-specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics revealed no indication of clinically significant differences in ethnicity or the effect of smoking to pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazoni was similar in patients with severe cardiac insufficiency compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study involving human liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the influence of liver function on pharmacokinetics of Arizona, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of class C, which is not enough to pull loops on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on safety-harmacology, toxicity in repetitive gift, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and for canogens potential the preclinical data had no particular hazards in human beings.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicecologically significant effects were observed only with dosages or expositions, which exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure of people, so they have limited liability for clinical use only or no significance.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects recorded a dossier-dependent on toxicity (Lipofuscine-pigment cumulation and / or parenchymal cell loss) during rats to 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (corresponds to 10 times the mean Steady-State exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, a cholelithip was found as a result of the removal of sulfate-conjugate in the Gall of apes after repeated oral gift of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the 1- to triple) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16- to 81fold of the recommended maximum dose when people is based on mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="98">However, at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found in the highest recommended daily dose of hydroxy- Aripiprazole no more than 6% of the concentrations, which were found in the study about 39 weeks in the gall of monkeys, and are far below the limit values (6%) in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">These effects were observed in rabbits which resulted in expositions of 3- and 11fold of the mean Steady-State AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an anti-microtubuli active ingredient reducing the microtubules from the tube agent and stabilizes the microtubuli by inhibiting their depression.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to a inhibiting of the normal dynamic reorganisation of the microtubular network which is essential for the vitale interphase and the exotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that Albumosis has been mediated in the endothelial cells and within the framework of in-vitro studies proved that the presence of Albumin the transport of Paclitaxel is supported by endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is believed that this improved transentielial transport is mediated by the gp-60-album Acceptors and due to the albumeric protein acidic rich in cysteine) a Paclitaxel accumulation in the area of the tumors occurs.</seg>

<seg id="317">10 According to an intravenous gift of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the Paclitaxel plasma concentration took off a multifunctional mode.</seg>
<seg id="318">The average distribution volume amounted to 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume has an extensive extravasculous distribution and / or wheat-binding of Paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study of patients with advanced sound tumors, the pharmacokinetic properties of Paclitaxel were compared to intravenous 30 minutes for intravenous 30 minutes, with the values after a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 solvent containing Paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The clearing of Paclitaxel was higher after the Abraxane-gift (43%) than after a solvent containing Paclitaxel injection, and also the distribution volume was at Abraxane higher (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the literature on in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue coating is reported that Paclitaxel is metabolic in first line to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel) metabolized.</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer was reduced to 4% of the given total dose with less than 1% of the given total dose with less than 1% of the metabolism 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel, which indicates a far-reaching non-renal clearing.</seg>

<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study was injected at least eight weeks of Eprex / Erypo in a Vene before they were either sent to Abseamed or continue to Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main Indicator for the effectiveness was the change in hemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the distribution period in the weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also put the results of a study in which the effects were investigated by the skin speculated dropping by those of Eprex / Erypo in 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients who had caused anaemia were caused by kidney problems, the hemoglobinds were killed in the same degree as among the patients who still received Eprex / Erypo.</seg>

<seg id="386">Anamiesymptomome and follications can be different depending on age, gender and total disease load; therefore, the assessment of individual clinical trials and disease is necessary due to the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="387">An increase in hemoglobins by more than 2 g / dl (1,25 mmol / l) should be avoided for a period of four weeks.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability of patients a single hemoglobins can occasionally be observed or under the hemoglobins target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">In view of this hemoglobinvariability the hemoglobin targets should be tempted by 10 g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the hemoglobins increased by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month, or if the permanent hemoglobin value is 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epetine-alfa dosage is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epetine alfa in the lowest approved dose, which is required for the control of anaemia and Andimiesymptomss.</seg>
<seg id="392">The present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low height (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.75 mmol / l) may require higher yield rates than patients where the initial anemia is less difficult (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The present clinical results suggest that patients with a very low hardness value (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.25 mmol / l) may require higher yield rates than patients where the initial anemia is less difficult (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>

<seg id="588">Treatment of osteoporosis • postmenopausal women • in men with an increased risk of fractures, including patients with a recent undisputed low-traumatic collapse.</seg>
<seg id="589">For the post-menopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men an intravenous infusion of 5 mg Aclasta is recommended once a year.</seg>
<seg id="590">In patients with low-traumatic holes, the administration of the infusion of Aclasta is recommended two or more weeks after the operating supply of the hats (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For the treatment of Morning Paget Aclasta should only be prescribed by physicians, experience in the treatment of Moravian Paget.</seg>
<seg id="592">After a treatment of the Morning Paget to Aclasta a long Remissional period was observed in patients who have been addressed to the therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is very advisable to ensure a sufficient supply of calcium, corresponding to at least 500 mg of elemental calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a recent undisputed low-traumatic error correction, a initialdose of 50,000 to 125,000 is recommended for oral or intramuscular vitamin D before the first Aclasta infusion is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="595">The prevalence of symptoms, which occur within the first three days after administration of Aclasta, may be reduced from Aclasta's gift using Aclasta's application.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with kidney dysfunction (see section 4.4) In patients with a creatine Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min Aclasta is not recommended because limited clinical experiences for this patient group.</seg>
<seg id="597">Older patients (≥ 65 years) A Dosage adaption is not necessary because the bio availability, distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and adolescents Aclasta is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age because data are missing and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="599">Aclasta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure (Kreatine Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min), since this patient population lies only limited clinical experiences.</seg>
<seg id="600">An existing hypokaline is before the start of therapy with Aclasta due to sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Due to the rapid integration of the effect of zoledronic acid on bone structure, a temporary, mitigated symptomatic hypokaline can develop, whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the infusion of Aclasta (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is very advisable to ensure a sufficient supply of calcium, corresponding twice daily at least 500 mg of elemental calcium, for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="603">Cancer disease, chemotherapy, treatment with corticoeroids, bad oral hygiene) should be detected before applying bisphosphonate a dental examination with appropriate predefined dental treatment.</seg>
<seg id="604">For patients who need dental handles, no data is available if the interruption of treatment with bisphosphonates reduces the risk of osteonecroses in the field of jaw.</seg>
<seg id="605">The clinical assessment by the treated doctor should be the basis for treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="606">The frequency of symptoms, which occur within the first three days after administration of Aclasta, may be reduced from Aclasta's gift using Aclasta's application (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="607">The prevalence of serious side effects reported by prehoped numbers was increased in patients who received Aclasta (1.3%) (51 of 3,862) compared to patients who received placebo (0.6%) (22 of 3.852).</seg>
<seg id="608">In the osteoporosis studies (PFT, HORIZON - Recurgent Fracture Trial Chamber [RFT]) was comparable to placebo (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%).</seg>
<seg id="609">Very frequent (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000), rare (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) undesirable medicines are listed in Table 1.</seg>
<seg id="610">Kidney-interference Coledronic acid was associated with kidney dysfunction (i.e. an increase in serum-creatine) and in rare cases as the acute cardiac failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">The change in the creatine Clearance (measured before the administration) and the occurrence of kidney failure and a reduced kidney function were similar to osteoporosis during three years between the Aclasta- and the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase in serum-creatinine within 10 days of administration was observed at 1.8% of patients treated with Aclasta treated patients compared to 0.8% of treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on analysis of laboratory data the temporary calcium values, which were below the normal fluctuation area (less than 2.10 mmol / l), at 2.3% of patients treated with Aclasta in a large clinical trial patients treated with Aclasta in the Moravian-Paget-studies.</seg>
<seg id="614">All patients received adequate amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study on postmenopausal osteoporosis, in the study to prevent clinical fractures after a hats and in the Moravian-Paget studies (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study on avoidance of clinical fractures after a recently revised thrift, the B1-D mirror was not routinely measured, but the majority of the patients received a initialdosage of vitamin D before the administration of Aclasta (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions According to the administration of Zoledronic acid in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions to the infusion, such as tubes, swelling and / or pain (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteonecrosen in the orchards region was mainly reported in cancer patients, about osteonecrosen (primary in the orthored region), which were treated with bisphosphonades, including Zoledronic acid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had the signs for local infections, including osteopathitis, and the majority of reports relates to cancer patients to dental veneer or other dental instruments.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 study involving 7,736 patients showed osteonecrose in a pine forest with Aclasta and a placebo treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="620">In case of an overdosage which leads to a clinical relevant hypokaline, may be achieved through the gift of oral calcium and / or an intravenous infusion of calcium gluconate to compensate.</seg>
<seg id="621">Clinical efficacy in the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis (PFT) once a year for 3 consecutive years (7,736 women aged between 65 and 89 years) with either one bone density- (BMD) and at least two light or a medium-existing editary congestion, or a BMD-T score for the Schenkelhas ≤ -2.5 with or without signs of an existing cycline structure.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on morphometric cycline factions Aclasta significantly decreased over a period of three years and already after one year the incidence of one or more new vertebrates (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Aclasta-treated patients of 75 years and older had a reduced risk for spinal sex fractures compared to placebo patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on hip fractures Aclasta reported a constant effect over three years, which resulted in a reduced risk of bouncing fractures in one by 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%).</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on the bone density (BMD) Aclasta increased the bone density at the lumbar agic acid, hip and distal radius compared to placebo (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9% increase of the bone density of lumbar spine by 6.7%, the total thigh increased by 6.0%, the scraper reduced by 5.1% and the distal radius by 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">Bone histology At 152 post-menopausal osteoporotic patients treated with Aclasta (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70) were taken from the third annual dose of bone biopsies from the pelvic mud.</seg>
<seg id="628">A microcomputerised tomography (µCT) analysis showed with Aclasta treated patients compared to placebo a increased bone volume and receipt of the trabecular bone architecture.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone marital markings markings (BSAP), the N-terminal propeptid of type-collagen (P1NP) in serum and the beta-C-Telopeptid (b-CTx) in serum samples were determined in subgroups of 517 to 1.246 patients in periodic intervals during the study period.</seg>
<seg id="630">Treatment with an annual 5 mg dose Aclasta reduced BSAP after 12 months significantly by 30% compared to the initial value and was kept at 28% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was reduced significantly by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTx was reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">The vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of the patients received a initial dose of vitamin D (50.000 to 125,000 but oral or intramuscular) 2 weeks before infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">The total mortality was 10% (101 patients) in the group treated with Aclasta, compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) in the HORIZON-RFT study increased the Aclasta treatment in comparison to placebo treatment the BMD on the total thigh and scrapers of all points.</seg>
<seg id="636">The Aclasta treatment led over 24 months in comparison to placebo treatment an increase of the BMD around 5.4% in total and 4.3% on the crankhals.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in males In the HORIZON RFT study were randomized to 508 men and 185 patients were evaluated by the BMD after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to demonstrate a reduction in clinical fractures in men; the frequency of clinical fractures was 7.5% in Aclasta-treated males compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study involving men (CZOL446M2308), the once annual administration of Aclasta was included in comparison to the percentage change of the bar vertebra BMD after 24 months compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical efficacy of treatment with Morning Paget of the bone Aclasta was examined in patients and patients at the age of 30 years with radiologically confirmed morphine Paget of the bone (middle serum levels of alkaline phosphatase according to 2.6fold up to 3.0fold specific upper standard value for inclusion in the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The effectiveness of an infusion of 5 mg of zoledronic acid is taken once daily during 2 months during a period of 2 months compared to comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the combined results, a similar decrease of pain level and pain was observed in comparison to the initial value for Aclasta and Risedronat after 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as responding to the therapy at the end of the six-month main study (on therapy) could be taken up in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">Of the 143 with Aclasta and 107 with Risedronate patients who took part in the follow-up study, the therapeutic contact could be kept at 141 of the patients treated with Aclasta compared to 71 of the patients treated with Risedronate patients during a mean follow-up period of 18 months after application.</seg>
<seg id="645">One-time and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting infusion of infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg of zoledronic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data that referred to as dosisan.</seg>
<seg id="646">After this, the plasma concentration increased rapidly to &lt; 10% of the highest value after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 hours, followed by a long lasting phase, no more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Mixed-phase disappearance from the large cycle with half-life t ½ α 0.24 and t ½ to 1.87 hours, followed by a long elimination phase with a scheduled elimination period t ½ g 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early distribution phases (α and β, with the above t ½ -values) probably represent the fast resorption in the bone and the deposition of the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 h 39 ± 16% of the approved dose in the urine, while the rest is mainly bound to the bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body Clearance is independent of the dose of 5,04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains unaffected by gender, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion period of 5 to 15 minutes resulted in the decrease of the tick-acid concentration by 30% at the end of infusion, but had no effect on the surface under the curve (plasma concentration of time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A reduced clearing of by cytochrome P450 enzyme metabolic systems is unlikely because zoledronic acid is not metabolized in humans and because it does not have a weak or not direct and / or irreversible, vibrating dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see Section 4.2) The renal clearing of the Zoledronic acid correlated with the creatine Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the creatine Clearance, and amounted to 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in a slight decrease (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate renal function until reaching a creatine clearing up to 35 ml / min no dose adjustment of the coledronic acid demands.</seg>
<seg id="655">Because for severe kidney dysfunction (Kreatinine Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) only restricted data is possible for this population no statements possible.</seg>
<seg id="656">Toxicity The highest non-acting intravenous dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight and rats 0,6 mg / kg body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">For studies in dogs, single doses have been 1.0 mg / kg (based on AUC the 6fold of the recommended human therapeutic exposition), administered over a period of 15 minutes, good and without an renal improvement.</seg>
<seg id="658">Subchronic and chronic toxicity in studies with intravenous application was given a 15-minute infusion in 3-day intervals, a total of 6 times (a cumulative dose, which corresponds to approximately 6 times (a cumulative dose, which corresponds to the 7fold of human therapeutic exposure, relative to the AUC, corresponds to the AUC, corresponds to).</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated use in cumulated expositions, which exceeded the maximum of the intended Human exposure, the toxicological effects of other organisms, including gastrointestinal tract and liver, as well as to the intravenous injection point.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most frequent report with repeated use was to multiply primary Spongiosa in the metaphysical of the long bones in the growth phase with almost all dosages, a fund that reflects the pharmacological, antiresortive effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">Rats observed a teratogenicity at doses ranging from 0.2 mg / kg as external and inner (visceral) abnormalities and such a skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">In rabbits, no teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed, although the maternal toxicity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg due to the lowest serum-calcium mirror.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public The present document is a summary of the European public assessment report (EPAR), in which explains how the Committee for Human-Compensation (CHMP) has performed the conducted studies in order to access recommendations concerning the application of medication.</seg>
<seg id="750">Acetate is applied to treatment of type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes), where metformin (a diabetic medicine) can not be applied. • It can be applied together with another diabetic medicine (Dualtherapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">In addition, metformin patients (especially above important patients) can be applied, which can't be satisfactory in the highest tolerable dose alone in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulphur resin or insulin, the present dose of sulphur resin or insulin can be retained at the beginning of acetate treatment, except for patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); this should be reduced to the dose of sulphur resin or insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's own insulin is better, and the blood sugar level drops better, reducing type 2 diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="754">In case of more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of acetate in Tripletherapy was investigated; in addition, patients received a combination of metformin with a sulphur resin, in addition they received either acettos or placebo for 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies, the concentration of a substance was measured in the blood (glycopylized hemoglobin, HbA1c) which shows how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">In addition to a lowering of the HbA1c value, which means that blood glucose levels has been lowered by 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the Tripletherapy study the effect of an additional gift of acettos on the existing treatment with metformin and a sulphur resin in a decrease of HbA1c values of 0.94%, while the additional gift from placebo led to a decrease of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, in which the combination of acettos and insulin was examined in 289 patients, patients who took action in addition to insulin, lowering the HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared to 0.14% compared to placebo which took additional placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events associated with Actos were vision disorders, infections of the upper respiratory tracts (cold), weight gain and hypothesis (reduced sensitivity to maturity).</seg>
<seg id="760">Acettos must not be applied to patients either (allergic) against Pioglitacon or one of the other parts, even in patients with liver problems, congestive heart failure or diabetic Cetoazir (high hardness levels - acidity level - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that acettos should serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with metformin in patients, where metformin is not displayed in which metformin is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000 the European Commission announced the company Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited approval for placing on account of account in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white and white, round, curved and carry on one side the mark "15" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitacon is also shown for the combination with insulin type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is inadequate, and in which metformin due to contraindications or incompatibility (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For the use of Pioglitacon in patients under 18 years of age, no data is available, therefore the application is not recommended in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients receiving at least one risk factor (e.g. former heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should start the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose continuously.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure, weight gain or oil, especially those with reduced cardiovascular reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure, weight gain and estrogen occurs when Pioglitazon is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular study involving Pioglitacon in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes mellitus and existing advanced macrovascular disease was carried out.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in reports of cardiac insufficiency, which however did not lead to an increase of mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output liver data (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the norm range) or with other signs of a liver disease may not be used to Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirror increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the standardisation range, the liver data are as soon as possible to control.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient is designed to refer to a hepatic dysfunction, such as unclarified nausea, vomiting, toressness, fatigue, appetite and / or darker Harn, are the liver data values to verify.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision to continue whether the treatment of patients with Pioglitazone should be continued until the pre-order of the laboratory parameters of clinical assessment.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with Pioglitacon, a dosgrazing weight gain was detected, which can be used by grease deposits, and in some cases with a liquid range.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a hemodilution performed under the treatment of Pioglitacon a lower reduction in the middle hemoglobin (relative reduction by 4%) and hematokrits (relative reduction of 4.1%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative studies with pioglitacon in patients under metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobins by 3-4% and hematokrits by 1-2%) and the insulin (relative reduction of hemoglobins by 1-2% and hematokrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity, patients receiving pioglitacon as oral branch or triple-combination therapy with a sulphur resin or as a branch-combination therapy with insulin, the risk of a dosisdependent hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">Following the market launch, including Pioglitazon, including Pioglitacon, a deterioration of a diabetic macular edema was reported, with a reduction of visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear if there is a direct connection between taking Pioglitacon and the occurrence of macular edemons, but they should be aware of a macular edema, if patients have to report on disruptions of visual acuity; a complete ophthalmologic examination should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of messages unwanted events of undesirable, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients who were treated with Pioglitacon</seg>
<seg id="782">The applied fracture-incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years of treated with Pioglitacon treated women and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years of women who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the proactive study, a study of 3,5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular disease reported fractures at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures for 100 patient years) compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients that were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy, and if a patient wishes or enter a pregnancy, the treatment is taken (see Section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies for examining the interactions have shown that Pioglitacon has no relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmaceutical dynamics of Digoxin, Warfarin, phenol, and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with drugs which are metabolized by these enzymes, such as oral contraction, Cyclosporin, calcium blocker and HMGCoA-reduction inhibitor are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of Pioglitacon with gemfibrous (a cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase of the AUC of Pioglitacon around the 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of pioglitacon with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a decrease of the AUC of Pioglitacon by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is primarily attributable to treatment with Pioglitazone who reduces hyperpampinemia and increased non-resistant insulin-resistant insulin-resistant increase in the loss of metabolic substrates.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; often &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000; rare &gt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (from present data not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="791">They lead to a temporary change in the Turgors and the refractive index of the lens, as they can also be observed in other hypoglycemic effects.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with Pioglitacon, ALT-infection about three times the upper limit of the norm range is similar to as below placebo but less than in comparative groups below metformin or sulphate resin.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an Outcome study in patients with pre-existing macrovascular disease, the frequency of a severe cardiac insufficiency was 1.6% higher than placebo when Pioglitacon bzw.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch, rarely about cardiac insufficiency was reported in Pioglitacon, however, when Pioglitacon was used in combination with insulin-failure in patients with congestive heart failure.</seg>
<seg id="795">There was a summary analysis of messages unwanted events of randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitacon-treated groups and more than 7.400 patients treated with comparative medication-treated groups.</seg>
<seg id="796">During a period of 3.5 years of ongoing proactive study, fractures were treated with 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with Pioglitacon patients, compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients that were treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">In taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, 180 mg / day after seven days there were no symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone seems to work with activating specific core receptor (peroxisome proliferator of reptor-γ (PPAR-γ)), which leads to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver, grease and skeleton muscular cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitacon reduces the Glucosine production in the liver and increases the peripheral Glucosystem use in the case of insulin resistant.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study involving Pioglitacon versus Gliclazide as Monotherapy has continued over two years to investigate the time until the time of the therapeutic effectiveness (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 treatment months).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the onset of therapy, a blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) could be calculated by Pioglitacon at 69% of treated patients (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclazid).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study over 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was discontinued despite three imonatibility optimisation, to Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under pioglitacon, the mean hbA1c - value was reduced by 0.45% compared to patients who still only received insulin; a reduction in the insulin-insulin-treated group was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year, under Pioglitacon introduced a statistically significant decline in the album / creatine quotients compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitacon (Monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small scale based on type 2 diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical studies, compared to placebo a reduction of the overall plasma triglyceride and the free fatty acids and an increase in HDL- cholesterol levels as well as slightly, but clinically not significantly increased LDL- Cholesterinspiegel.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitacon compared to Plazebo, Metformin or Gliclazide the total plasol glycopic acid and free fatty acids and increased the HDL cholesterol level.</seg>
<seg id="808">In comparison to Plazebo was no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol levels while in metformin and Gliclazid decreased values.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study more than 20 weeks, Pioglitacon reduced triglyceride, but also improved triglyceride level, which has an effect on triglyceride absorption as well as to the hepatic Triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the proactive study, a cardiac study Outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and existing advanced macrovascular disease were randomized to have a time of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular disease either to the existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, Pioglitacon is absorbed quickly, with the top concentration of dumplitacon in plasma usually 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">This basis corresponds to the contribution of M-IV to efficacy in about three times the effectiveness of Pioglitacon, while the relative effectiveness of M-II minimally pronounced.</seg>
<seg id="813">In Interaction studies, Pioglitacon has no relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmaceutical dynamics of Digoxin, Warfarin, phenol, and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of pioglitacon (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) increases the plasma concentration of Pioglitacon (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral application of radioactive marketed Pioglitacon in humans, the marker was found mainly in the fever (55%) and a lower extent in the harness (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma-elimination uptime of unchangeable Pioglitacon is 5-6 hours, while the total active metabolism is in 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentration of Pioglitacon and its metabolism are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than with healthy volunteers, but the rates of the oral clearing of the parent is similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies appeared in mice, rats, dogs and apes, after repeated administration, with hemodilution, anemia and reversible eccentric cardiac hypertrophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is primarily attributable to treatment with Pioglitacon which reduces hyperpineinemia and increased non-resistant insulin-resistance of dams and reduces the availability of metabolic substrates for the reddish growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long term studies (up to 2 years), hyperplasia (in male and female rats) were ininduced by male and female rats (male and female rats).</seg>
<seg id="821">In a veterinary model of the family-family polyposis (FAP), treatment with two other thiazolions lead to an increased frequency of colonies.</seg>
<seg id="822">The tablets are white-whitish, round, flat and wear on one side the mark "30" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="823">The applied fracture-incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years of treated with Pioglitacon treated women and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years of women who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the proactive study, a study of 3,5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular disease reported fractures at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures for 100 patient years) compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients that were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study about two years the effects of a combination therapy of metformin, each with Pioglitacon or Gliclazid were examined.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year, under Pioglitacon demonstrated a statistically significant decline in the album / creatine quotients compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazone reduced triglyceride level, but improved triglyceride level, which has an effect on the Tryglyceride absorption as well as to the hepatic Tryglizd synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study was missing as regards their primary endpoint, a combination of the total mortality, non-deadly coronarisation, leg amputation above the ankles, coronary revolascularization and Revascularization and Revascularisation and Revascularisation and Revascularisation and Revascularisation and Revascularisation and Revascularisation and Revascularisation and Revascularisation and Revascularisation and Revascularisation and Revascularisation and Revascularisation and Revascularisation and Revascularisation and Revascularisation and Revascularisation and Revascularisation and Revascularisation and Revascularisation and Revascularisation and Revascularisation and Revascularisation and Revascularisation and Revascularisation and Revascularisation and Revascularisation and Revascularisation and Revascularisation and Revascularisation and Revascularisation and Revascularisation and Revascularisation and Revascularisation and Revascularisation and Revascularisation and Revascularisation and Revascularisation and Revascularisation and Revascularisation and Revascularisation and Revascularisation and Revascularisation and Revascularisation and Revascularisation and Revascularisation and Revascularisation of the</seg>

<seg id="865">In the study, after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance (glycopylized hemoglobin (HbA1c) was measured, which shows how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="866">Actraphane led to a decrease in the HbA1c spider that indicates that blood sugar levels have been lowered considerably, like with another human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="867">Actraphane should not be applied to patients that react oversensitive to human insulin (DNA) or one of the other parts.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only doctors who are familiar with immunosressive therapy and treatment of transplant patients, this medicine should be classified, or make changes in the immune-intensive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Because of clinically relevant differences of the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus this can lead to graft reactions or to an increased incidence of adverse events, including under- or immune response.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients always maintained the same Tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; reversing of the formulation or regimes should only be performed under the narrowful control of a medical profession (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a result of a changeover to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic pharmaceutical monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments will be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus remains.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Advagraf should be primarily based on clinical assessment of waste and tolerability in individual fall and on blood-reflective specifications (see below "recommendations</seg>
<seg id="1415">After conversion from Prograf to Advocf the Tacrolimus valley should be monitored in front of the changeover and over two weeks of changeover.</seg>
<seg id="1416">On Day 4, the systemic exposure time was measured as a valley level with both forbons both with kidney and transplanted patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated controls of the Tacrolimus valley level are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation, in order to ensure adequate substance exposure in immediate recovery phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Since Tacrolimus is a substance with low clearing can take a change of the Advocf-Dosisschemas several days until the Steady State is reached.</seg>

<seg id="1422">Further dose adjustments can be later necessary since the pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus can change in the process of stabilization of patients after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dose recommendations - liver transplant prophylaxis of transplantation. oral Advantine therapy should begin with 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift at the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Recommended Dosage - changeover from Prograf to Advocf must be converted to a daily dosage of prograf capsules at a time daily intake of Advagraf, this changeover is taken at a ratio of 1: 1 (mg: mg), relative to the entire daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">Kidney and liver transplant after a changeover from other immunosressiva to Advocf once a day the treatment with the recommended initials recommended dose for the prophylaxis of transplantation begin.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Transplantation in adult patients who are converted to Advocf is an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg per day once daily.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplant receivers Obdo not have clinical experience with Advantage in lung cancer, pancreas and darmtransplanted patients in a oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day, with pancredentified patients at a oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day and for intestinal transplants in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dose adjustment in special patient groups with reduced liver function for maintaining blood-tales in the targeted sphere can be necessary in patients with heavy liver function and a reduction of the dose.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function When kidney function does not exercise impact on pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus, it may be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrotoxic potentials of Tacrolimus a careful monitoring of the renal function (including a regular determination of the serenciratine mirror, a calculation of creatinine and monitoring of the urinary volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Changeover from Ciclosage to Advocf At the changeover of a Ciclosporine - to a Tacrolimus-based therapy is caution (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Recommendations on the valley level in full blood The dose should be primarily associated with clinical assessment of exhaust and tolerability in single fall under inability of full blood-blood-blood-level controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform frequent controls of the Tacrolimus valley level during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic inspections during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood-valley mirror of Tacrolimus should also be controlled by Prograf at Advantf, Dosage customization, modifications of immune soup-intensive therapy or with continuous use of substances that could change the Tacrolimus whole blood concentration (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advantf is a drug with a low clearing, customization of the dose may require several days until the Steady State entered.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical trials make sure that a successful treatment is possible in most cases when the valley mirror should not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the valley level of Tacrolimus are in full blood in the first time according to liver transplant usually in the range from 5 - 20 ng / ml and worried patients with 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent retention of liver, kidney and palms, blood concentrations in the range from 5 - 15 ng / ml were generally used.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events including graft reactions or other side effects, which can occur in a row of Tacrolimus sub- or overexposition.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients always maintained the same Tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; reversing of the formulation or regimes should only be performed under the narrowful control of a medical profession (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with graft reactions, which attaching to other immunosressiva as therapy, no clinical data for the retardized formulation of Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1442">To the prophylaxis of the graft reactions in adult heart transplant and graft reactions in childhood are no clinical data for the retardized formulation of Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Due to potential interaction, which can lead to a reduction of the Tacrolimus mirror in the blood and a feasibility of the clinical effect of Tacrolimus, is the intake of Herbal medicine, the Johanniskraut (hypericum perforation), or avoid other plant healing during treatment with advancing (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">Patients with diarrhoea is a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimus concentrations in the blood, as the Tacrolimus blood level could be subjected to such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, under Prograf, considered a cardiac opathy called Kammer- or septumhypertrophie, which can therefore occur below the agraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors which increase the risk of such clinical disturbances are already existing cardiac disease, a treatment with corticoeroids, kidney or liver function, infections, fluid load and oil.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosressiva, the impact of sunlight or UV light should be restricted by suitable clothing or using a sun protection by means of a high protective factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients receiving tacrolimus, symptoms of pores like headache, changed awareness of consciousness, alternators and vision disorders, should be a radical investigation (e.g.</seg>
<seg id="1449">Since Advancf hard capsules, retanness, lactose is included in patients with the rare lactose-lactose intolerance, lactase deficiency, or glucose-gactose body absorption.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or plant medications that are known as inhibitor or inductors from CYP3A4 can increase metabolism of Tacrolimus and thus reducing the blood values from Tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">Therefore, it is advisable to change the Tacrolimus- blood level when changing substances that can change the CYP3A metabolism and adjust the Tacrolimus dose to maintain the smooth concentrations (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetics studies revealed that the increase of the blood level mainly from the increased bioavailability of Tacrolimus, caused by the inhibition of the gastrointestinal propitiation, results.</seg>
<seg id="1454">High-level prednisolon or methylprednisolon, as it is used in acute exhaust actions, can increase the concentration of Tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">Effect of Tacrolimus to the metabolism of other medicines Tacrolimus is known as the CYP3A4 inhibitor; therefore the simultaneous application of Tacrolimus can be metabolized by CYP3A4, whose metabolism will affect the metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Since Tacrolimus put down the clearing of steroid contraction and thereby the hormones can increase, it is particularly careful in the decisions of receiving measures.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal experiments have shown that Tacrolimus can reduce the clearing of Pentobarbital and phenol, and extend their half hours.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a low number of investigations to transplant patients do not provide evidence that under Tacrolimus a increased risk for unwanted events in regard to the course and the result of pregnancy.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the specifications available since the initial approval of the CHMP, the CHMP has continued to be positively rated as a positive, but considering that the safety profile is closely monitored in the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, the CHMP based on the basis of the security code from ADVATE, which makes a submission of PSURs every 6 months, decided to apply a further extension procedure for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited (CHMP) shared the company that the company has its application for approval for the placing on the market for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">However, normally the breast, the brain, bones, or Weird parts (tissue, which combines other structures in the body, is surrounded and leans) of it.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a kind of virus, which was genetically modified that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">With the virus in Advexin, this is a "Adenovirus" which is so altered that there is no copies of itself, and so that no infections could be redeemed in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin could be injected directly into the tumours and enable the cancer cells to form the normal p53 protein again.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53-protein that is made out of the human body existing p53 gene, usually carries damaged DNA and to kill cells in when the DNA can't be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">In case of Li-Fraumeni cancer, the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein is not correct, and the cancer cells can grow and share it.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study in a study involving the Li-Fraumeni cancer in the field of undermining, in the bones and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP grants the company's answers to the questions, still some questions were unexplained.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the testing of the initially submitted documents the CHMP is created on Day 120 a list of questions that will be sent to the company.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP diagram, the injection of advances in Li-Fraumeni-tumors has been advantages for patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee further concerns relating to the processing of medication in the body, the type of administration as well as the safety of pharmaceuticals.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company had not been demonstrated that advances in this reliable way, and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in contact with the patient, is harmful.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company translated the CHMP not of it if the withdrawal consequences for patients who currently participate in clinical trials, or "Compassionate-Use" programs with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"modified action" means that the tablets are assembled so that one of the effective components are immediately released and the other slowly over a few hours.</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of the seasonal allergic rhinitis (Heuvup, caused by an allergy against pollen inflammatory inflammation) in patients with nocous membranes (stopped nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and teenagers over 12 years, the recommended dose of Aerinaze twice daily is one tablet, which should be taken with a glass of water or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of treatment should be as short as possible and terminated once the symptoms, especially the swelling of the mucous membranes (stopped nose).</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medication can be redone on the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main effective measures were the changes in the severity of the hayloft symptoms which were reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary with a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In consideration of all Heuvupfensac symptoms except for the constipation of the nose reported patients, the Aerinaze's income, compared with a decrease in symptoms by 46.0%, compared with 35.9% compared to the patients suffering from the disease in the disease.</seg>
<seg id="1662">When only the swelling of the nocous membranes were considered, the patients were treated under Aerinaze a reduction of symptoms by 37.4% versus 26.7% compared to 26.7% in patients that desloratadin alone proceeds.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common adverse events of Aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are Tachyon, mental arithmetical hyperactivity (hypertension), constipation, headache, tiredness, tiredness, Insomnia (insomnia), somnolence (slump), sleep disturbances and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be applied to patients who may not be sensitive to desloratadin, pseudoephedrin or one of the other parts, against adore substances or Loratadin (another medicinal product to treat allergies) are not applied.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze may not be applied to patients that suffer from a narrow angle glaucoma (hypertension), heart or vascular diseases (hypertension), hyperthyroosis (hypertension), hyperthyroosis (oversight of thyroid) or already have a hemorrhagic impact (caused by a brain bleeding) or having a risk for a hemorrhagic impact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007 the European Commission granted the Company SP Europe to approval for placing the placing of aerinaze in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, however, is in total to swallow it (i.e. without breaking them to break or cut up).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be used in children under 12 years due to the lack of data for infertility and efficacy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible, and should not be continued after the symptoms of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days, since at long time application the activity of Pseudometedrin can take time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After a decline in the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory case, treatment with dessert can be continued as a monotherapist.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerinaze Pseudodhedrin, the medicine is also contradicated in patients that are treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor or within 2 weeks after the termination of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to the illamimetical activity of the combination of Pseudoephedrin, with other vasoconstrictors, Pergoydroergyamin or other decongestiva, the peroral or nasal than abnormal. phenylpropanamine, phenyl propanamine, phenylegenin, ephatirin, OxyCazolin, Naphazolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and effectiveness of these combination therapy were not checked for this patient's patient and data are not sufficient to discuss appropriate recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Safety and efficacy of aerinaze have not checked in patients with kidney or liver function and data are not sufficient to address corresponding recommendations for the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed about that treatment at occurrence of hypertension or from Palpitations, heart rhythms, diarrhythmia, nausea or etaiding other neurologic symptoms (such as headache or a amplification of the headaches) must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="1677">In the treatment of following patients groups: • patients under DIGITALIS • Patients with hypertension • patients with hypertension • patients with hypertension infarction in the anamines, diabetes mellitus, bladder, or bronchospasmus at the Anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze must terminate at least 48 hours before performing dermatological tests, as antihistamine, otherwise agreed upon indicators for skin reaction, or reduce in its extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the framework of clinical trials with Desloratadin, in which Erythromycin or Ketoconazol was also given, however, no clinically relevant interaction or changes of the plasma concentration of Desloratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">In the results of psychic-controlled tests, no significant differences between the patients treated with desloratine and placebo was detected, regardless of whether desloratine was alone or taken with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the Metabolism of Desloratadine enzyme was not yet identified, so that interactions with other medicines can not be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin inhibits in vivo CYP3A4 and in vitro studies have shown that the medicine CYP2D6 is not inhibits and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoprotein.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The inability of use of aerinaze during pregnancy is not backed by a large number of pregnancies, however, no increase in frequency of abnormalities in comparison to the frequency of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproductive studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and due to the vascular properties of Pseudoephedrin should not be applied to aerinaze in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be clarified in fact that in very rare cases it can occur in very rare cases that can lead to a impairment or ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">Symptoms can vary between one ZNS depression (sedation, Apnoe, reduced mental attention, cyanosis, coma, heart circulation collaps) and one ZNS-stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, Tremor, convultures) with possible breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, exhaustive heart failure, heart rhythms, respiratory, respiratory, palpitations, thirst, nausea, vomiting, precordials pain, dizziness, tinnitus, seaweeds and hypertension or hypotonia.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A zNS-stimulation is particularly likely in children, like atropin-typical symptoms (mouth troscopy, pupil rigid and - dilatation, hood, hyperthermia, and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both inhibiting of proinflammatory cytokinen such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-8 and IL-13 of human mastic cells / basophile, as well as the inhibition of the expression of the adjuvant molecule P seless on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In an individual dosage study with adults Desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement sizes of the flight performance including the amplification of subjective or the tasks that are connected to flies.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical studies, at the recommended dosage of 5 mg, no increased frequency of disparity was detected in comparison to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of Pseudoephedrin in the recommended dosage can produce more sympathetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, a speedometer or manifestations of a zNS-regression.</seg>
<seg id="1693">There were 1,248 patients at the age between 12 and 78 years with seasonal rhinitis, with 414 patients received Aerinaze pills.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histaminantagonist effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets, determines from the total number of symptoms (apart from nasal densely swelling), significantly higher than under a monotherapy with Pantidephedrin for the 2 weeks treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The efficacy of Aerinaze Tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determines from the nasal mucinal swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with Desloratadin on the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The efficacy of aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences in regard to sex, age or ethnic origin.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Within a single dose study on pharmacokinetics of Aerinaze's desloratadine is detectable in plasma 30 minutes after administration.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroratory application of Aerinaze in healthy volunteers over 14 days, the fluency of Desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and Pseudowel rin on Day 10 was achieved.</seg>
<seg id="1699">As part of a pharmacokinetic multi-dossier, which was carried out using the formulation as a tablet to healthy adult subjects, was found that four subjects of Desloratadin was badly damaged.</seg>
<seg id="1700">An components-interaction study shows that exposure (Cmax and AUC) of Pseudoephedrin, according to the sole gift of Pseudoephedrin, bioequivalent to exposure to an Aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on the conventional studies on safety technology, toxicity in repetitive gift, toxicity and reproducibility. however, the preclinical data of desloratadin provide any special hazards of human beings.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient Pseudoephedrin.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive clinical trials, the combination of Loratadin / Pseudoephedrin during a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits were not terated in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>

<seg id="1709">Inform your doctor if you are diagnosed or diagnosed under the application of Aerinaze with following symptoms or diseases: • hypertension, palpitations • heart rhythms • nausea and headache or a amplification of existing headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1710">When taking Aerinaze with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other medicines, or recently, even if it is not prescribed for prescription medicinal products.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Transport and use of machines At use in the recommended dosage is not to calculate that Aerinaze leads to benchmarks or attention.</seg>

<seg id="1718">About cases of palpitations, hunt, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, dizziness, cardiac disease, troublessness, anti-incidence physical activity, about cases of liver ignity and over cases of remarkable liver values also was also very rare.</seg>
<seg id="1719">It is as a 5 mg tablet, 5 mg- lophilisation for inserting (soluble tablet), 2.5 mg- and 5 mg melting tablets (tablets which dissolve in the mouth), 0.5 mg / ml syrup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution.</seg>
<seg id="1720">For children ages one to five years, the dose is 1.25 mg once daily, which is in the form of 2.5 msyrup or syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1721">For children ages six to eleven years, the dose is 2.5 mg once daily, either in the form of 5 ml syrup or respectively.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was studied in total eight studies comprising about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four studies in seasonal rhinitis and two trials in patients who had also asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The effectiveness was measured by the change in symptoms (itching, number and size of paddling, impairment of sleep and performance on the day) and after six weeks of treatment was determined.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been submitted to prove that the body makes the syrup, solution to remove and processed melt in the same way as the tablets and use in children are unthinkable.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg Aerius became an average decrease in the symptom scores (symptom points) by 25 to 32%, compared to the decline of 12 to 26% in patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two studies in Urtikaria, the decline of symptom scores after six-week treatment with Aerius 58 and 67% compared to patients treated with placebo patients.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be applied to patients, possibly oversensitive (allergic) against Desloratadin, Loratadin or one of the other parts.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission granted the Company SP Europe to approval for the placing of Aerius throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once a day, with one or without a meal, for the reduction of symptoms in allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent rhinitis) and Urtikaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There are limited experience of clinical trials for efficacy in use of Desloratadin with adolescents from 12 to 17 years (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">Treatment of intermittent allergic rhinitis (appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks) should occur according to the previous illness, and it may be resumed after finishing the symptoms and the symptoms are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="1732">The persistent rhinitis (appearance of symptoms to 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks) may be recommended to patients during the allergy period.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interaction between clinical trials with Desloratadin tablets not detected, in which Erythromycin or ketoconazol were also given (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical-pharmacological study, while taking Aerius and alcohol the most efficient effect of alcohol is not reinforced (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be clarified in fact that in very rare cases it can occur in very rare cases, that can lead to a impairment or ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials in different indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more side effects in patients with Aerius were reported in patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common adverse events that were more common in placebo were fatigue (1,2%), mouth troscopy (0.8%) and headaches (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study with 578 youthful patients from 12 to 17 years, the most common side-headache was treated with 5.9% of the patients who were treated with Desloratadin and in 6.9% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">In a multi-dose trial which were given up to 45 mg of Desloratadin (nine clinical dose), no clinical-relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both inhibiting of proinflammatory cytokinen such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-8 and IL-13 of human mastic cells / basophile, as well as the inhibition of the expression of the Admonastic molecule P seless on Endothelialcells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">In the framework of a clinical study with multiple outlets, in the desloratadin a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days, no statistically significant or clinical-related cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical-pharmacological study, in the desloratadin a dose of 45 mg daily (the Neunfold of clinical dose) was administered over ten days, showed no extension of the QTc intervals.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In an individual dossier study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement sizes including the amplification of subjective or the tasks that are connected to flies.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in reducing the symptoms such as Niesen, Nasenroltion and Juckreiz of the nose, itching, lacriot and rocking of eyes as well as Juckriz on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis can be divided into intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent rhinitis is defined as the appearance of symptoms at 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As shown in the total of questionnaire to life quality in Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively decreased the pollution due to seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronic idiopathic urticaria was designated as a representative for other forms of urticaria, since the underlying pathology of pathology was similar to different forms and chronic patients.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since the histological release is an causal factor in all urarious diseases, it is expected that Desloratadin also demonstrated in other forms of urticleia in other forms of urticaria; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective when improvement in Pruritus and the size of quaddles at the end of the first dose of dose.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamids in chronic idiopathic uria, the minority of the patients who did not react to Antihistaminika, from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Improvement of jewellery by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with desloratadine patients compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">The treatment with Aerius reduced the disturbance of sleep and wax significantly, as measured by a 4-point rating for evaluating these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study, which patients were similar to patients with the general seasonal allergic rhinitis -population, was achieved in 4% of patients a higher concentration of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no evidence points for clinical-relevant cumulation after a daily use of Desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the Metabolism of Desloratadine enzyme, however, was not yet identified, so that interactions with other medicines will not be excluded</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadin inhibits in vivo-not CYP3A4 and in vitro studies have shown that the medicine CYP2D6 is not inhibits and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoprotein.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dossier study with Desloratadin in a dose of 7.5 mg actual meals (greasy, calorie rich breakfast) not on the availability of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The trials carried out with desloratadin and Loratadin in a comparable degree of exposure of Desloratadin, no qualitative and quantitative differences concerning the toxicability fils of desloratine and from Loratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on conventional studies on safety-harmacology, toxicity in repetitive gift, genotoxicity and reproductionate the preclinical data of Desloratadin provide any special hazards of human beings.</seg>

<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be applied to the protection against the flu caused by the tribe (type) H5N1 of the Influenza-A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special kind of vaccination that could cause a strain of influenza, to protect a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">The epidemic breaks out when a new strain of Grippevirus diving, which can easily be spread out of human being, because humans have no immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">After administration of the vaccine, the immune system detects the immune system contained in the vaccination of influenza virus and forms an antibody against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">This makes the immune system later in the position to form a contact with a Grippevirus of this family-faster antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Afterwards, the membrane cover of the virus with the "surface antigens" (protein found on the membrane surface that detects the human body as physical activity), are cleaned and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">A inspection of some of the study centers showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">Thereby, the scope of the clinical data base for the assessment of the vaccine must not be fulfilled in order to fulfil the requirements of the guidelines of the EMEA for prepandemic vaccines.</seg>

<seg id="1905">For patients who can't swallow capsules, Agenase is available as a solution for adjusting, but this can not be taken together with Ritonavir because the safety of this combination was not examined.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Agenase should only be classified when the doctor has examined what antiviral medicines had previously taken before, and the likelihood is judged that the virus will speak to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, which together with twice daily 100 mg of Ritonavir and with other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">For children between four and twelve years and with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of Agenase is based on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">Agenase reduces HIV in combination with other antiviral medicines at a low level in combination with other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1910">AIDS is not able to heal the immune system, so that the development of associated infections and diseases would not hesitate.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenase, in combination with other antiviral medicines, however, was examined without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults, which previously did not have been treated with protease.</seg>
<seg id="1912">With low dosional Ritonavir reinforced medicines Agenase, was compared with 206 adults, which had taken earlier protease inhibitor compared with other proteins.</seg>
<seg id="1913">Main Indicator for the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with non-detectable concentrations of HIV in blood (virusload) or the change of viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies of patients who had no protease inhibitor had taken after 48 weeks in gengenase more patients a viral load of 400 copies / ml as under Placebo, but Agenase had less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenase also reduced the viruslast, but with the children who had been treated with protease inhibitor were only very few to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who were treated with protease inhibitor were treated with Ritonavir reinforced medicines Agenase the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment as well as other protease inhibitor:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In the patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protease inhibitor, it came together with Ritonavir with a stronger trash of viral load after four weeks than in the patients who proceeds up their previous protease inhibitor:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common adverse events of Agenase (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea (kidney), Nausea (nausea), vomiting, rash and Fatigue strength (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenase cannot be applied to patients that are possibly oversensitive (allergic) against Ambavir or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenase can also not be applied to patients, the currant herb (a vegetable preparation for treating depression) or pharmaceuticals, which are in the same as Agenase, and are in high concentrations in blood health harmful.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, the gengenase, the risk of a lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), an osteonecrose (symptoms of bone tissue) or a immune activist (symptoms of infection that causes recovery immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">In combination with other antiretroviral medicines, the Medicines Committee (CHMP) came to the conclusion that the benefits of generic inhibitor in combination with other antiretroviral medicines are treated with HIV-1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenase is generally taken together with the pharmacokinetics amplifiers Ritonavir, but the committee noted that the benefit of generic inhibitor in patients who have not taken no protease inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1924">Agenase was originally approved under "extraordinary circumstances" since the time of approval for scientific reasons, only limited information.</seg>
<seg id="1925">October 2000, the European Commission granted the Glaxo Group Limited by approval for placing the placing of Agenase in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Generic is found in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1-, protease inhibitor (PI) -previously treated adults and children over 4 years.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually Agenase capsules are supposed to be administered to the pharmacokinetd boosted by Ambavir together with low doses of Ritonavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of Ambavir should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance of the patients and the pre-treatment of the patients (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bidder angle of Ambavir as a solution for inserting is 14% less than one capsule; therefore, Agenase capsules and solution for inserting on a milligrams per milligrams is not interchangeable (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenase capsules is 600 mg of Ambavir twice daily with 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenase capsules without the reinforced additive of Ritonavir (boosted) must be applied, higher doses have to be applied to gengenase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenase capsules is 20 mg of Ambavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg of Ambavir, which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of gengenase in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other Proteasants were not examined in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age, based on the lack of data to incomprehension and efficacy (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose to Agenase capsules in adult patients with medium-heavier liver function is reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with heavy liver function is reduced to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous application should be used in patients with mild or even liver function when patients with severe liver function is contra-indexed (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenase cannot be given simultaneously with drugs which have a small therapeutic width and also display substrates of the cytochrome P450-Isoenzms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Vegetable supplements, the Johanniskraut (hypericum perforation) may not be applied due to the risk of reducing plasma concentration and a reduced therapeutic effect of Ambavir during the intake of Ambavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be noted that gengenase or any other antiretroviral therapy did not lead to a cure of HIV infection, and that they may continue to develop opportunist infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy including treatment with Agenase prevents HIV from HIV to other by sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually Agenase capsules are supposed to be applied together with low doses of Ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients who suffer chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with an antiretroviral combination therapy, an increased risk of severe liver interactions with potentially fatal course.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of simultaneous treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant information about this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with pre-existing liver function including chronic hepatitis men demonstrate an increased frequency of liver function under an antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous application of Agenase and Ritonavir with fluorticason or other glucose levels are not recommended unless the potential benefit of a treatment is overtaking the risk of systematic corticosteroid effects including Morbus Cushing and support of the side-level function (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the reduction of the HMG-Coa-Reductase inhibitor Lovastatin and Simvastatin is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, a simultaneous administration of Agenase with Lovastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended because of the increased risk of myopia including Rhabdomyolysen.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life-threatening side effects, such as Carbamazepin, phenytoin, phenytoin, phenyl antidepressants and Warfarin (under surveillance of International normalization ratio), methods to determine the concentration of action.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients receiving these medicines at the same time, Agenase can be less effective because of the reduced plasma concentration of Ambavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic effects associated with Ambavir, the effectiveness of hormonal contraction can be changed, however, the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">When methadon is given simultaneously with ambavir, patients should therefore be monitored on oopiatentssymptomome, especially if there are also low doses of ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Because of the possible risk content of a toxicity in due to the high propylene glycol solution, this formulation is contracted in children under an age of four years and should be applied with care in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Agenase should be set to duration 5 if an impact is accompanied by systematic or allergic symptoms or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">Patients who received antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors, has been reported about the occurrence of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia or an incidence of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases related to their therapy medicines that are associated with diabetes mellitus, or hyperglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and with pharmaceutical-dependent factors such as a longer lasting antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders, associated.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Patients (type A and B) that were treated with protease inhibitor are reports of an increase of bleeding including spontaneous cutaneous hematoma and hematthroes.</seg>
<seg id="1957">In HIV-infected patients with severe immunodegrading patients, an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART) can develop a flammable reaction to asymptomatic or residuous opportunist infections which leads to severe clinical circumstances or deterioration.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multifactorial equatorial is assumed (including application of corticoeroids, alcohol consumption, higher body-measure index), cases of osteonecrose in particular in patients with advanced HIV-disease and / or long-term application of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic width of Agenase may not simultaneously possess certain therapeutic width and also display substrates of cytochrome P450-Iso enzms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width of Agenonavir can not be combined with pharmaceuticals, whose active ingredients are primarily used via CYP2D6 and associated with increased plasma factors with serious and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It was shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in the AUC of Ambavir, which can lead to a virological failure and lead to a resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">Attempting to compensate the lowest plasma factors due to a dose increase of other protein inhibitors in combination with ritonavir, very frequently unwanted effects were observed in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="1963">Johanniskraut (hypericum perforation) The serum mirror of Ambavir can be lowered by simultaneous use of plant preparation with Johanniskraut (hypericum perforation).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If the patient takes part in the direction of Johanniskraut, the Ambristavirspiegel and, if possible, to check the virusload and remove the Johanniskraut.</seg>
<seg id="1965">A dose adjustment for one of the medicinal product is not necessary when clove is administered along with ambavir (see also Eshirk below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increased, for Cmax, by 30%, when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with ambavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, dosages of 600 mg of Ambavir were used twice daily and Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily used to prove the effectiveness and infertility of this treatment schematic.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% lower when Ambavir (750 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with caletra (400 mg lopinavir + 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of Ambavir in plasma, which were achieved in combination with Kaletra (400 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than when Ambavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1970">A dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Ambavir and Kaletra can not be given, however, however, a close monitoring is recommended because the effectiveness and inability of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There was no pharmacokinetic study on the use of Agenase in combination with didanosine, however, due to the antacide component of didanosine, however, the revenue from Didanosin and Agenase are at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in combination with ambavir (600 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) no dose adjustment is required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with egg dementia in combination with ambavir and Saquinavir is not recommended since the exposure of both protease inhibitor would be lower.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirains on other protease inhibitors and existing limited data can be assumed that Nevirapin could possibly be detonated by Ambavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In case this drug should be used simultaneously, caution, since Delavirdin due to the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma factors may be less effective.</seg>
<seg id="1976">When these medicines are used together, caution is commanded; a thorough clinical and virological surveillance should be made, as an exact forecast of the effect of the combination of ambavir and Ritonavir are difficult to be difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous administration of Ambavir and Riomutin led to an increase in plasma concentration (AUC) of Riomutin to 193% and thus leads to an increase of rifugal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1978">When it is required for clinical reasons, Riomutin together with Agenase will be sufficient to reduce the dosage of Riberutin at least half of the recommended dose, although no clinical data lie.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with Agenase in combination with Erythromycin were not performed but could be increased the plasma factors of both medicines in case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg of Fosamper avir with 200 mg ketoconazole once a day resulted in an increase of the amount of Cetoconazol in plasma by 25% and AUC (0-}) to 2.69times in comparison to the value, which was observed once daily without simultaneous use of Fosamper avir with Ritonavir once daily.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines that are listed below, including Substrate, inhibitor or inductors of CYP3A4, can be used together with Agenase, possibly lead to interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be associated to toxic reactions that are associated with these medicines if they are used in combination with Agenase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other protease inhibitors it is advisable that Antazida should not be taken at the same time as Agenase, as it can come to resorption disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous application of anti-vulsives known as enzymes are known (phenytoin, phenobarbital, Carbamazepin), with Ambavir can lead to a tlower of the plasma factors of Ambavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">The serum levels of calcium-kaners such as Amlodipin, dipin, dipin, pine-pin, nifeetpin, Ninsdipin, Ninsdipin and Verapamil can be increased 10 by Ambavir, thereby increasing the activity and toxicity of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The congestion with Agenase can significantly increase their plasma concentration and enhance PDE5 inhibitors in conjunction with PDE5 inhibitors, including hypotment, vision and priapism (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, in the Ritonavir 100 mg capsules twice daily, together with 50 µg of Fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days were increased, while endogenous Kortisol decreased by approximately 86% (90% defide interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous administration of Agenase with Ritonavir would not be recommended to these glucose concentrations together with these glucose concentrations, unless the potential benefit of a treatment is the risk of systemic corticostly (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">In HMG-Coa-Reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose contamination are strongly dependent on CYP3A4, are distinctive enhancements of the plasma factors at the same administration of Agenase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plasma factors of this HMG-Coa-reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathy including a Rhabdomyolysis, it is not recommended to combined use of this drug using Ambavir.</seg>
<seg id="1991">A frequency monitoring of therapeutic concentrations as to stabilization of the mirror is recommended since the plasma concentration of Cyclosporin, Rapamycin and Tacrolimus can be increased with the benefit of Ambavir (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Act shall not be applied together with oral-recorded tendzolam (see Section 4.3), while using Agenase, with parentric Midazolam be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous use of paralyzolam with other protease inhibitors refer to a possible increase in plasma factors from Midazolam to 3-4 times.</seg>
<seg id="1994">When methadon is administered together with ambavir, patients should therefore be monitored on oopiatentssymptomome, especially if there are still low doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the very low reliability of historical comparisons, no recommendation can be given as Ambavir- dose is given when Ambavir is administered simultaneously with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">In simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants together with Agenase, a amplification of the INR (International normalized ratio) is recommended due to the possibility of weak or amplification of the antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contraction is not predictable, therefore also alternative methods for the conception of conception.</seg>
<seg id="1998">A careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example Desipramin and Nortryptilin) is recommended for the simultaneous administration of Agenase (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">During pregnancy, this drug may only be used after a careful remedy of the possible uses for the mother in comparison with the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk lactivated rats, Ambavir-related fabrics have been proven, however, it is not known whether Ambavir are explored in breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproductive study of worsened rats who was administered by the innization in the uterus to the end of the breastfeeding of Ambavir, showed a reduced increase of 12 body weight during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of childbirth including fertility and reproduction was not impaired by the administration of Ambavir to the parent.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The indentiality of Agenase was studied in adults and children 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of these side effects associated with the Agenase treatment were slightly up to be completed, early in the early morning, and rarely led to the treatment process.</seg>
<seg id="2005">Many of these events is not clarified whether they are in connection with the ingestion of gengenase or another at the same time to the HIV-treatment, or whether they are a consequence of the disease's disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the above-mentioned adverse events are from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which the previously untreated patients were not previously treated with 1200 mg of Agenase twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4), which were reported standing by the examination in connection with the study medication, and in more than 1% of patients were performed, as well as in the treatment of imaging lab changes (Grade 3 to 4).</seg>
<seg id="2008">The antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with a distribution of body fat (Lipodystrophy) in HIV-patients, including a loss of peripheral and fauna fat tissue, increasing intraocular and visceral fat tissue, hypertrophy of the breasts and dororectal fat collection (Sticks).</seg>
<seg id="2009">Under 113 antiretroviral non-treated persons who had been treated with ambavir in combination with lamivudin / zidovudin over a medium length of 36 weeks was only one case (Sticks) (&lt; 1%).</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROAB 3006, 245 NRTI- pre-treated patients were performed under Ambavir 7 cases (3%) compared to 27 cases (11%) in combination with various NRTIs over a medium length of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Skin covers usually slightly mild to moderate, erythemed or macult nature, with or without juckriz and usually occur during the second treatment week and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks, without causing the treatment with ambavir had to be canceled.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Osteonecrose cases were especially reported in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV-disease or long-term application of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In HIV-infected patients with severe immunodeficiency effect, an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART) can develop flammable reaction to asymptomatic or residenial opportunist infections (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">Patients treated with PI pretreated Ritonavir (Grade 3 to 4) and laboratory changes (Grade 3 and 4) were observed twice daily with low-condensed Ritonavir (Grade 3 and 4), which were observed with low glyceride and CPK values, who received Agenase in patients who received Agenase together with low-sensitive Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of an overdosage, the patient is on signs of a poisication (see section 4.8), if necessary, necessary support measures are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Ambavir binds to the active center of the HIV-1 protease and prevents the processively viral gag- and gag-pol- polynomenants with the consequence of a formation of undisputed, non-infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of Ambavir in vitro was studied against HIV-1 IIIB both in acute and chronic lymphocytic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) as well as in peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% inhibitor concentration (IC50) of Ambavir is in the range from 0,012 to 0.08 µM in acute cells and amounts to 0.41 µM in chronically infected cells</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of Ambavir against HIV-1 in vitro and inhibition of the HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral non-treated patients with the currently approved Fosamplavir / Ritonavir doses have been observed - as with other Ritonavir blocked treatment schemas with protease inhibitors - the described mutations only rarely observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In sixteen years of 434 antiretroviral patients who received 700mg of Fosamputlavir with 100mg of Ritonavir twice daily in the study ESS100732, a virological error occurred up to week 48, with 14 isolate genotype could be studied.</seg>
<seg id="2022">Genotype analysis of Isolate of 13 of 14 children, where a virological error occurred within the 59 closed, with protease inhibitor not treated patients showed resistance patterns that were similar to those with adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V3I, K20R, K3I, I3I, I50V, I50V, I54V, I54V, I54V, I54V, I54V, V82A / I, I84V, I85V, I85V, L90M, and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 and their extension APV30005 and their extension APV30005 (700 mg Fosamplavir twice daily: N = 107) in patients with viroomic prohibitors over 96 weeks, the following protease inhibitor mutations were observed:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Based on genotype resistance tests, Genotypical interpretations can be used to estimate the activity of Ambavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-11 algorithm for fosampraavir / Ritonavir defined resistance than the presence of the mutations L10F / I, I54A / C / F / F / F, I84V and L90M in conjunction with a decreased resistance to Fosamplavir with Ritonavir and a reduced probability of a virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">Conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutation pattern can be subject to additional data, and it is recommended to use the actual interpretations systems for analysis of the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Based on phantine resistance tests, clinically validated evaluation systems can be used in conjunction with genotypical data for estimation of the activity of Ambavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitors isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinically-phenotypic Cut-offs (dividers) for FPV / RTV, which can be used for interpretation of results of a resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with an reduced sensitivity against Ambavir associated genetic pattern creates a certain degree resistant against Ritonavir, the sensitivity against indinavir, Nelfinavir and Saquinavir.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data to cross-resistant between Ambavir and other protease inhibitor for all 4 fosamplavir resistance to either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">Based on five-twenty antiretroviral patients (one of them demonstrated a resistance against Lopinavir / Ritonavir (one of 25 Isolate), Incarinavir / Ritonavir (three of 25 trials), catchavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), Saquinavir (three of 24 insulators) and Tipranvir / Ritonavir (four of 24 insulators) and Tipranvir / Ritonavir (four of 24 insulators).</seg>
<seg id="2033">Vice versa, Ambavir retains its activity against some other protease inhibitor isolate near; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Early termination of a reconciled therapy is recommended to keep the infection of a variety of mutations in the limits that can act on the following treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The proof of the efficacy of Agenase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily based on the study (Virusload ≥ 1000 copies twice daily) together with Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) and Nustosidpioga (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, predominantly with lowest Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred threescore and sixty-threescore (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to asgenase, at least one other PI and at least one NRTI were included in the study study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis showed the non-superiority of APV / Ritonavir compared to the SOC-PI Group in terms of time-adjusted average change from the output value (AAUCMB) in plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-maintenance wave of 0.4 logged copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The proof of the efficacy of unleathered Agenase is based on two uncontrolled studies with a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 were treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In studies, Agenase solution to take and capsules into dosages of 15 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, with the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no low dosized Ritonavir at the same time; the majority of those treated with PI pretreated patients had at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs combined with Agenase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of the patients enrolled in the study included a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration of &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml with a median increase in CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74).</seg>
<seg id="2042">19 Based on these data should be considered to be considered to be considered with PI pretreated children who are considered to be considered as expected "Agenase."</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral administration the average length (Tmax) to the maximum serum concentration of Ambavir amounts approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increased, for Cmax in contrast to 30% when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with ambavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of Ambavir with a meal leads to a 25% reduction in AUC but has no effect on the concentration of Ambavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore the minimum concentration in the steady-State (Cmin, ss) remains unaffected by the food intake, although the simultaneous intake increases the extent and the rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg) and allows to close a large distribution volume and a broad penetration of Ambavir from the blood circulation in the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of action in plasma, with the amount of unlimited Ambavir, which represents the active portion, probably remain unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unborn Ambavir remains constant, the percentage of free active substances varies in the steady activity of the steady state in the steady state over the area of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Hence the pharmaceuticals, CYP3A4 induced or inhibitions or a substrate of CYP3A4 are given, with caution if they are given simultaneously with Agenase (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice daily or 15 mg / kg three times a day, leads to a similar daily Ambavir exposure such as adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Ambavir is made from the solution 14% less bio-available as well as from the capsules; therefore Agenase solution and Agenase capsules are not replaceable at a single grammbasis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">Also, the renal clearing of Ritonavir is neglected, therefore the impact of a renal function occurs on elimination of Ambavir and Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment schemes lead to ambavir plasma screens like those who have achieved in healthy volunteers according to a dose of 1200 mg of Ambavir twice daily without a simultaneous administration of Ritonavir twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies for canogenicity with ambavir in mice and rats came to male animals of hepatocyanew Adenauer (mice) or 3,8- (rat) of exposure to humans, according to twice daily gift of 1200 mg of Ambavir, said.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of hepatocellular Adenomas und Karzinome has not been clarified and the relevance of this observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">However, from the present study data on humans, both of clinical trials, as well as from the therapeutic use, however, had little indications for the assumption of a clinical relevance of this findings.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of in-vivo- and in-vitro Genotoxicity tests, the bacterial reverse printing tests (Ames-test), microcore test in rats and chromosome test test in human peripheral lymphocytes were Ambavir neither mutations nor genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">These liver toxicity can be monitored and proven in clinical use by measurement of AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">Until now in clinical studies, no significant toxicity in patients was observed, neither during the administration of Agenase even after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies on toxicity at young, which were treated from an age of 4 days, showed both the control and using Ambavir treated animals a high mortality.</seg>
<seg id="2062">In a systemic plasma exposition, significantly below (rabbits) or not significantly higher (rats) as the expected exposure of therapeutic dosage in humans were observed, however, a number of minor changes including thymuscles and lower skeleton changes observed that indicate a delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If Agenase capsules without the reinforced additive of Ritonavir (boosted) must be applied, higher doses have to be applied to gengenase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Agenase capsules is 20 mg of Ambavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg of Ambavir, which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">The simultaneous application should be used in patients with a weak or lighter liver function when patients with severe liver function is contra-indexed (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2066">26 For some medicines that may cause serious or life-threatening side effects, such as Carbamazepin, phenytoin, phenytoin, phenyl antidepressants and Warfarin (under surveillance of International normalization ratio), methods to determine the concentration of action.</seg>
<seg id="2067">Agenase should be set at duration 27 if an impact is accompanied by systematic or allergic symptoms or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2068">An increased risk for a lipodystrophy was associated with individual factors such as higher age, and with pharmaceutical-dependent factors such as a longer lasting antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2069">It was shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in the AUC of Ambavir, which can lead to a virological failure and lead to a resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="2070">508% increased, for Cmax, by 30%, when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with ambavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2071">The Cmin values of Ambavir in plasma, which were achieved in combination with Kaletra (400 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than when Ambavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2072">A dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Ambavir and Kaletra can not be given, however, however, a close monitoring is recommended because the effectiveness and inability of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Treatment with egg dementia in combination with ambavir and Saquinavir is not recommended since the exposure of both protease inhibitor would be lower.</seg>
<seg id="2074">When these medicines are used together, caution is commanded; a thorough clinical and virological surveillance should be made, as an exact forecast of the effect of the combination of ambavir and Ritonavir are difficult to be difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2075">When it is required for clinical reasons, Riomutin together with Agenase will be sufficient to reduce the dosage of Riberutin at least half of the recommended dose 31, although no clinical data lie.</seg>
<seg id="2076">The serum levels of calcium-kaners such as Amlodipin, diodiac, dipin, Nicahpin, Nifedipin, Ninsdipin, Ninsdipin and Verapamil can be increased by Ambavir, thereby increasing the activity and toxicity of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2077">In a clinical study, in the Ritonavir 100 mg capsules twice daily, together with 50 µg of Fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days were increased, while endogenous Kortisol decreased by approximately 86% (90% defide interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="2078">In simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants together with Agenase, a amplification of the INR (International normalized ratio) is recommended due to the possibility of weak or amplification of the antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2079">The simultaneous administration of Ortho-Novum 1 / 35 (0.035 mg Ethinylestraol plus 1.0 mg Norethindron) led to a decrease of AUC and Cmin by Ambavir by 22% respectively.</seg>
<seg id="2080">During pregnancy, this medicine may only be applied only after a careful remedy of the possible uses for the mother in comparison with the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>

<seg id="2083">In case of an overdosage, the patient is on signs of a poisication (see section 4.8), if necessary, necessary support measures are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2084">The antiviral activity of Ambavir in vitro was studied against HIV-1 IIIB both in acute and chronic lymphocytic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) as well as peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2085">The 50% inhibitor concentration (IC50) of Ambavir is in the range from 0,012 to 0.08 µM in acute cells and amounts to 0.41 µM in chronically infected cells (1 µM = 0.50 µg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2086">Vice versa, Ambavir retains its activity against some other protease inhibitor isolate near; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2087">Based on these data, these data should be considered as expected to be considered to be considered to be considered to be considered as expected "Agenase" using PI pretreated children.</seg>
<seg id="2088">While the absolute concentration of unborn Ambavir remains constant, the percentage of free active substances varies in the steady activity of the steady state in the steady state over the area of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss..</seg>
<seg id="2089">Hence the pharmaceuticals, CYP3A4 induced or inhibitions or a substrate of CYP3A4 are given, with caution if they are given simultaneously with Agenase (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2090">Also, the renal clearing of Ritonavir is negligible; therefore the impact of a renal function reduces the elimination of ambavir and Ritonavir.</seg>

<seg id="2215">Adverse events that were given by 252 into placebo-controlled clinical studies of phase III with Imiquimod-cream treated patients with actinent keratosis are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2216">These according to test plan shows that there is frequently controlled clinical trials with Imiquimod-cream with three-week treatment with Imiquimod-cream often to local skin reaction (61%), erosion / grapping / off (23%) and Ödem (14%) (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2217">According to the test plan, the clinical evidence shows that it was very frequent in these studies with Imiquimod-cream (31%), heavy erosion (13%), and heavy crushing formation and crust (19%).</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical trials for the examination of the application of Imiquimod for the treatment of actinic keratosis, Alopezie was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4% (5 / 1214) in the treatment session or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The unique unique orale intake of 200 mg Imiquimod, which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags, could lead to nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The clinically severe side effects, which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg, consisted in hypotonia, which normalized according to oral or intravenous liquid.</seg>
<seg id="2221">According to the topical application of Imiquimod, systemic concentrations of the alphabet and other cytokine were demonstrated after the topical application of Imiquimod.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 pivotal Phase 3 efficacy studies, the effectiveness in relation to a full recovery of the case is clearly superior to a placebo treatment over 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2223">In 60% of the total of 119 with Imiquimod treated patients the feignies were complete; this was 20% of the 105 patients treated with placebo (95% CI).</seg>
<seg id="2224">A complete remedy could be achieved in 23% of 157 patients treated with Imiquimod treated male patients, compared to 5% of 161 patients treated with placebo (95% CI)</seg>
<seg id="2225">The efficacy of Imiquimod at five-time application per week for 6 weeks was investigated in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target tumors were histologically confirmed single primary superfizial cell carcinoma with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The data presented from an open, uncontrolled long-term study, after four years of present data, about 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%)] of all treated patients were clinically exhausted and this also remained for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">The effectiveness of Imiquimod three weeks of regular application in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four-week treatment period, was investigated in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>

<seg id="2232">Aldara Cream was examined in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled studies of children aged 2 to 15 years with Molluscum Contagiosum (Imiquimod = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The efficacy of Imiquimod could not be shown in these studies in these studies (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or respectively).</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimum systemic absorption of the 5% Imiquimod-cream through the skin of 58 patients with aktinent keratosis was observed in three times weekly use during 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest therapeutic concentrations in the serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1, 0.2 and 1,6 ng / ml in use in the face (12.5 mg, 1 bag), on the scalp (75 mg, 2 bags) and in the hands / poor (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The calculated half-life time was approximately 10 times higher than the 2hour half-hour period according to the subcutaneous application in an earlier study; this indicates a prolonged retreat of the pharmaceuticals in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Data to the systemic exposure showed that the resorption of Imiquimod was low in low application to MC disease in age 6 - 12 years and comparable to healthy adults and adults with actinent keratosis or super-commercial basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study on the substrate toxicity at the rat, doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased milz weight; a four months of the pre-examined study showed a similar effects in the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study on carcinogenicity in mice use three days a week no tumors at the application point.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The corresponding mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimod is only a low systemic absorption of human skin and is not mutagen, a risk for people due to the systemic exposure can be seen very low.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumors found in the group of mice that was treated with real-free cream, earlier and in larger number than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>

<seg id="2277">In the study, mainly the safety of the medicine was investigated, however, its effectiveness was measured by taking its effect on the reduction of GAG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver (the liver was investigated).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under the age of five, Aldurazyme inherited the GAG concentrations in the urine around 60%, and half of the treated children had a normal great liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common adverse events of Althirazyme in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headache, nausea, abdominal pain, osteoathy (joint pain), back pain, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), heat and reaction to the infusion point.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very frequent side effects in patients under the age of five are elevated blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measurement size of lung function), speedometer (accelerated heart rate), fever and Schütt.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not react heavily in patients that react strongly to larvidase or one of the other parts (anaphylactic reaction), not used.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will update every year all new information that may be announced, and this summary required to update.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Althirazyme is treated patients who observe aldurazyme regarding the reactions and development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted Genzyme Europe B.V. an approval for the placing on the market of aldurazyme throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of the human α-L-Iduronidase and is produced by using recombinant DNA technology under the use of Cho-mammier cell cultures (Chinese Hamster OUT, Eierstock of the Chinese Hamsters).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is available for long-term enzyme-treatment in patients with a Muacchariaccharid I (MPS I, α-L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with aldurazyme should take place by a doctor, experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherent metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient carries this to be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">Safety and efficacy of aldurazyme in adults aged 65 years has not been determined, and for this patient no dosing scheme can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Safety and efficacy of aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver insufficiency was not determined, and for this patient no dosing scheme can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients with Aldurazyme treated patients can develop infusible reactions, which are defined as any part of the side effects that occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion day (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, these patients should continue to be closely monitored, and the infusion of aldurazyme should only be made in a reasonable clinical environment, in which recovery facilities for medical emergencies are available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical Phase 3 study, almost all patients IgG-antibodies against Laronidase, generally, is usually within 3 months from the course of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infusioned reaction, must be treated with caution using Aldurazyme (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">As little experience concerning repeating the treatment after a longer break, due to the theoretical increased risk of risk provisions, the treatment must be cautious after an interruption of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the beginning of infusion with medications (antihistamine and / or anti-pylock) to minimize the potential appearance of infusioned reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of slight or moderate infusioned reaction, treatment with anti-histamine and Paracetamol / Ibuprofen should be halted and / or a reduction of infusion rate to half of the infusion rate, in which the reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of individual, heavy infusioned reaction, the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are brought to decline, a treatment with antihistamine and Paracetamol / Ibuprofen is needed.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion rate can be resumed on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of infusion rate when the infusirate has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (Antihistamika and Paracetamol / Ibuprofen and / or Corticosteroids) as well as a reduction of infusion rate in 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of infusion rate, where the past reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be applied simultaneously with chloroquin or procain, because a potential risk of interference with intracellular recording of larvidase exists.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not leave direct or indirect adverse impacts on the pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since there were no data on newborns that were exposed to Laronidase, above the breast milk, it is recommended to be silent during treatment with aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Side effects in clinical trials were classified primarily as infusioned reactions, which were observed in 53% of patients in the phase 3 study (treatment duration of up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under the age of 5 (treatment duration of up to 1 year) were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Unwanted medication actions in connection with Althirazyme, who were observed during the Phase 3 study and their extension in total 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older with a treatment duration of up to 4 years, are very frequently (≥ 1 / 10); frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related participation of the upper airways and lungs in the prehistory, heavy reactions occurred, including bronchospasmus, respiratory, and facial oils (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Unwanted medication in connection with Aldurazyme, who were reported in a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5, with predominantly deformation form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months reported, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients it occurred within 3 months after the onset of treatment to a seropoversion, with patients at the age of 5 years with a severe deterioration form (on average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Until the end of the phase 3 trial (or to an early release from the study), 13 / 45 patients were detected by Radioimmunopcipitation (RIP) Assay detectable, including 3 patients, with which it never came to Serconence.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with missing up to a low antibody; a robust reduction in GAG Spiegels in Harn, while in patients with high antibody titres was to set a variable reduction in GAG in the harn.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in the phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study) demonstrated a marginal to low neutralisic effect on the enzymatic Laronidas- activity in vitro that seemed to affect clinical efficacy and / or the reduction of GAG in the harn.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not seem to stand with the incidence of undesired pharmaceuticals, even if the occurrence of unwanted medication actions typically coincided with the formation of IgG-antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reasons for the enzymes is in one of the acute substrate and preventing a further accumulation sufficiently restore the enzymes.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, larvidase is rapidly removed from the blood circulation and cells into the lysosomes, most likely via mant-6-phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Safety and efficacy of aldurazyme were analysed in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study at 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, showing the entire disease spectrum, the majority of the patients received by the mean phenotype and only one patient had the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had an expo expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and it had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the efficacy were the percentage of anticipated FEV and the absolute distance in the 6-minute walk.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open-label renewal study where they received more than 3.5 years (182 weeks) every week 100 E / kg Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy the patients were treated with Aldurazyme compared to the placebo group an improvement of lung function and ability to see in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">In the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintaining this effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Althirazyme group and a group of 182 weeks in the placebo / aldurazyme group as described in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the increase percentage of the FEV is not significant over this period of clinical and absolute pneumonia increased proportionally to the height of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a hepatoma of patients reached 22 (85%) to the end of the study a normal liver size.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks, a significant decrease in the GAG mirror in the Harn (µg / mg creatine) was determined that remained constant until the academic year.</seg>
<seg id="2326">Regarding heterogeneous disease manifestation between the patients, which has been taken into account the clinically significant changes in the five-minute walk test (to be expected), no change in 10 patients (58%), no change in 9 patients (22%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">An old open phase 2 study was conducted in which mainly the safety and pharmacokinetics of aldurazyme was examined at 20 patients, who were in the study at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years old (16 patients with severe deterioration form and 4 with the middle course form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosing was increased because of elevated GAG- mirrors in the Harn week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients, a size of magnitude (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) was determined according to the Z-Score for this age group The younger patients with severe deterioration form (&lt; 2,5 years) and all 4 patients with the middle course form had a normal mental development speed, whereas only no progress made in cognitive development.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, investigations into the dynamic effects of various Aldurazyme dosing schemes were carried out on the GAG mirror in the harn, the liver volume and the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosage scheme with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can represent in patients who have difficulty with weekly infusion; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical efficacy of these two dosing schemes is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will evaluate any new information that will be available annually, and if necessary, the summary of the characteristics of the medicine is updated.</seg>

<seg id="2364">Patients who were treated with Alimta and Cisplatin survived average 12,1 months, compared to 9.3 months at the filing of Cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">Patients who previously received chemotherapy was the average survival time with Alimta 8.3 months compared to docetaxel in 7.9 months.</seg>
<seg id="2366">However, in both studies, however, patients with cancer were not responsible for the record epithelial cells, during the administration of Alimta longer survival, than with the comparative clinical medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission granted Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. An approval for the placing of Alimta in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Each bottle-bottle must be effected at 4.2 ml 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml), resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The corresponding volume of the necessary wick dose is taken and diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml (see Section 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">ALIMTA is shown in combination with Cisplatin to first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small bronchialcarcinoma except for vast sign of epithelial histology (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in Monotherapy is indicated for the treatment in two-line treatment of patients with Lo- Kal advanced or metastatic non-small bronchial cancer. (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² body surface (KOF) administered as an intravenous infusion of a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day treatment course.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of Cisplatin is 75 mg / m ² KOF as infusion of a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after the Pemetry infusion - infusion on the first day of each 21-day treatment course.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Patients with non-small bronchialcarcinoma after precursing chemotherapy is the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² KOF administered as an intravenous infusion of a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">To reduce the frequency and severity of bonnet actions a day before and on the day of the Pemetrexed gift as well as the day after the treatment a corticoeroid was given.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During seven days before the first dose Pemetremixed must be taken at least 5 doses of folic acid and intake must be continued during the whole treatment period and for another 21 days after the final Pemetry dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients must also receive intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 micrograms) in the week before the first Pemetremixed dose and after each third bar cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients treated with Pemetremixed, it should be created in front of every gift a complete blood pattern, including differentiation of the leukocytes and a Thrombozygale.</seg>
<seg id="2379">The alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartat transaminase (AST or SGOT) and Alanine-transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment course, a dose test must take place under consideration - the Nadirs of the blood of blood or the maximum non-hematological toxicity of the forecasted treatment cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After recovery, the patients have to be treated according to the references in Tables 1, 2 and 3, to apply for ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC degree 2 blood.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients develop non-hematological toxicity ≥ degree 3 (excluding neurotoxicity), the patient must be interrupted with ALIMTA, until the patient needs the value before treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">Treatment with ALIMTA must be canceled when patients occurs after 2 dose of hematological toxicity or non-hematological toxicity 3 or 4 or so- continue at the appearance of grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies have no indication that in patients at age 65, or compared to patients at age 65, an elevated side risk is increased.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to non-sufficient data to incomprehension and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical studies, in patients with a creatine Clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min, there were no dose adjustments that may be recommended for all patients with recommended dose adjustments.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data base in patients with a creatine Clearance of under 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function of &gt; the 1.5-fold of the upper limit value (in cases of liver metastases) or &gt; 5.0 times the upper limit value (in presence of liver metastases) are not studied especially in studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must not be monitored with regard to the bone structure and Pemetrev may not be given to patients before their absolute neutrophilic number has a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the Thrombo- cytes number again achieved a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dose of dose for further cycles is based on the Nadir of absolute neutrophilic number, Thrombocytennumbers and maximum non-hematological toxicity, as they were observed in the previous therapy courses (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction of degrees 3 / 4 hematological toxicity, like neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with degree 3 / 4 neutropenia, when a pre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 was carried out.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore all patients treated with Pemetremixed patients, folic acid and vitamin B12 should be used as prophy- lactate measure to reduce toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to medium cardiac insufficiency (NSAIDs) such as Ibuprofen and acetylsali- cyls (&gt; 1,3 g daily) for at least 2 days prior to therapy, at least 2 days prior to therapy with Pemetrev (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients who are intended for therapy with Pemetrev is necessary to avoid taking NSAIDs with long half-life for at least 5 days prior to therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with Pemetrev (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients receiving these events, corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, existing hypertension or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore, in patients with clinically significant fluid tolerance in transcellular space a drainage of the connection to the Pemetrev treatment can be detected.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 serious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and herebrovascular events were reported in clinical trials with Pemetremixed occasionally when this substance was usually given in combination with another cytotoxic drug.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous application attenuinated life dimmer (except yellow fever, these vaccination is contra-indicated) not recommended (see section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of an irreversible skull was remixed by Pemetremixed, men should be pointed out to treatment - Ginn insisted on advice regarding the sperm enhancement.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal kidney function (Kreatine-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min), high doses of non-steroid chloric acid (NSAIDs, such as Ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage (≥ 1.3 g daily) to a reduced Pemetremixed lot with a result of increasing awareness of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Therefore be careful if patients with normal kidney function (Kreatine-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of NSAIDs or Ace- tylsalicylic acid can be used in high dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen) or acetylsalicyl- acid in a high dosage for at least 2 days prior to therapy, must be avoided by treatment with Pemetrev (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since there are no data concerning the interaction with NSAIDs with long half-life such as Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous application must be avoided for at least 5 days prior to therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with Pemetre- are avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The large intra-individual variability of coupling status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplasty chemotherapy requires increased monitoring frequency of INR (International normalized ratio), if the decision was taken to treat the patient ducks with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of Pemetremixed near Schwanres, but as in anguise antimetabolites are expected to be severe birth defects.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetremixed may not be applied during pregnancy, except if necessary, and after careful turning of the useful life for the mother and the risk for the fetus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Since the possibility of an irreversible damage caused by Pemetremixed, men should be pointed out before the treatment start, consulting on the sperm cells.</seg>

<seg id="2517">The probability of recurring gastrointestinal symptoms (see section 4.8) can increase if alli is taken together with a low-fat single meal or low-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">As the weight reduction can be used in diabetes with improved metabolic control, patients who consult a drug with alli before the start of therapy with alli to consult a doctor or pharmacist, because the dosage of anti-diabetic activity must be adapted.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients receiving alli as well as pharmaceuticals against hypertension or an increased cholesterol level, should ask their doctor or pharmacist whether the dosage must be adjusted to this medicine.</seg>

<seg id="2522">When the application of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat could affect the Quick values (international normalized ratio, INR) (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">In most patients who were treated with orlistat in clinical trials up to 4 full years with orlistat, the concentrations of vitamins A, D, E and K as well as the beta carotenes are treated.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, the patients should be recommended to ensure a supplementary multivitamin supplement to ensure a sufficient vitamine intake (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">After the gift of one single dose Amiodaron was observed with a limited number of healthy volunteers who received orlistat at the same time, a lower decrease in the Amiodaron plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Animal experimental studies show no direct or indirect adverse impacts on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The effects of Orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and depend on pharmacological effects of the pharmaceutical, as the absorption of recorded fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">The gastrointestinal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally easy and temporary.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is applied on chemotherapies, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as Cisplatin), as well as chemotherapies, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin or Carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of Aloxi can be increased by an additional administration of a Corticosteroids (a medicinal product that can be used as antiemetry).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The application for patients under 18 years is not recommended, as to the effects in this age group is not enough information.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the substance has the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was investigated in three main studies on 1 842 adult, chemical therapies, which are strong and moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapies, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients who were treated with Aloxi in the 24 hours after chemotherapy was no vomiting (132 out of 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with Ondansetron patients (126 from 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">For chemotherapies, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients who were treated with Aloxi in the 24 hours after chemotherapy was no vomiting (153 of 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with Ondansetron patients (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In comparison with Dolasetron these values are 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission granted Helsinki branch Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. a approval for the placing of Aloe in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indexed: to prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in heavily emetogenic chemotherapy due to a cancer-disease and vomiting with moderate chemotherapy due to a cancer disease.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The effectiveness of Aloe to prevention of nausea and vomiting, which is induced by a strong inetogenic chemotherapy, can be increased by adding a Corticosteroids in front of chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can extend the coloint surgery, patients should be monitored by an amnesty decreasing or signs of a subacute Ileus after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">Like with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, caution was charged with the benefit of Palonosetron with pharmaceuticals, which extends the QT interval or in patients where the QT- interval is extended or those that tend to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Except in connection with another chemotherapeutics gift, Aloxi is supposed to be used in the days after chemotherapy nor to the treatment of nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies of inhibitors Palonosetron identified the activity of the five examined chemotherapeutics (Cisplatin, Cyclophosphamide, Cycloabin, Doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study no significant pharmacokinetic interaction among a one-time intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a steady concentration of Metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In one of a population based pharmacokinetic analysis showed that the simultaneous administration of CYP2D6-inhibitors (Amiodaron, Celecoxib, oxetine, oxetine, spoxetine, spoxetine, razed, sertraline and terbinafin) had no significant impact on the Clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience to use Palonosetron in human pregnancies occur not, therefore Palonosetron should not be applied at fluctuations, unless it is necessary to be deemed necessary by the treat doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical trials, the most common dose of 250 micrograms (a total of 633 patients), which at least could be related to Aloe at least, headaches, headaches (9%) and alarising (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions at the administration site (Burning, hardening, complaints and pain) were reported in post-marketing experience.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage, similar Frequencies of adverse events showed in the other dosage groups; there were no dose action relations.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were performed, but due to the large distribution volume, a dialysis is probably not effective treatment with an Aloxi- overdosage.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients / m2 Cisplatin, Carboplatin, ≤ 1,500 mg / m2, placebo and 250 mcg / m2 of cyanosetron were treated with patients who received 32 mg Ondansetron (half-time period 7.3 hours), which was given at day 1 without Dangeethasone intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study, 667 patients who received a strong emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazin as well as 250 or 750 micrograms of Palonosetron, were compared to patients who received 32 mg of Ondansetron who received 1 intravenous day.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of studies with moderate chemotherapy and the study with strong emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials investigating chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of Palonosetron were similar to blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters, including the respective effects of Ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After the findings of clinical studies, Palonosetron has the ability to block the Ionary channels in the ventricular de- and repolarisation to extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study carried out at 221 healthy volunteers were the assessment of the ECG-effects of i.v. of clung Palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption For intravenous gift follows an initial decrease of the plasma concentration of a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half-duration of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally disproportionately in the entire dose range of 0,3- 90 μ g / kg.</seg>
<seg id="2638">According to the intravenous gift of Palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the average (± SD) increase in Palonosetron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">From pharmacokinetics simulations, that at once daily intravenous gift of 0.25 mg Palonosetron in 3 consecutive days reached total exposition (AUC0- ∞) which was comparable to an intravenous intravenous administration of 0.75 mg; however, the Cmax was higher after the set of 0.75 mg higher.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% of the kidneys were eliminated, and another 50% are eliminated in two primary metabolites compared to Palonosetron in less than 1% of the antagonist effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In vitro studies for Metabolism, CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 and CYP1A2 has been involved in the Metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination following an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron were found approximately 80% of the dose within 144 hours in urine, Palonosetron as an unaltered substance made approximately 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a one-time intravenous Bolusinski injection, the total body-rate 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal clearing was 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Although patients with severe liver function disruptions the terminal elimination time and the average systemic exposure of Palonosetron increases, a reduction in the dose is however not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical studies, effects were observed only after expositions that are considered adequate for the maximum human therapeutic exposure, which indicates a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 From preclinical trials stated that Palonosetron can block only in very high concentrations of Ionary channels, which can be involved in the ventricular de- and repeal period.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose entree in about the 30fold of the therapeutic exposure of people), carried out daily over two years, led to an increased frequency of liver tumors, endocrine neoplasmen (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, annierenmark) and skin cancer in rats, but not in mice.</seg>

<seg id="2660">June 2006, the Committee on Human Nutrition Agency (CHMP) adopted a negative report in which the prohibiting of approval for the treatment of hepatitis C is recommended for the treatment of hepatitis C for the treatment of Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that Alpheon should be similar to Roferon-A with the same practices neili effective part, which is already approved in the EU (also called "Reference Substances").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (one by virus infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">A microscopic investigation shows the liver tissue damage, and the values of the liver enzyme Alanin- aminotransferase (ALT) is increased in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast into which a gene (DNA) was transferred to the formation of action.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon presented data to the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (active structure, composition and purity of the medication, effects, safety and efficacy of hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study on patients with hepatitis C, the efficacy of Alpheon was compared to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study was measured as many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks as well as 6 months after adjusting the treatment to the drug (i.e. no signs of the virus referred to in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">In addition, concerns relating to the stability of the drug and the pharmaceutical products were not sufficiently explained.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C that talked to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After setting the treatment with Alpheon, the disease has increased again in more than with regard to the reference rate; in addition, Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from that, the test was included in the study to evaluate a immune response (i.e. the body is antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine), not adequate.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used for the treatment of Impetigo (one with a crushing formation of skin infection) and small ininfected Lazerations (Rissor chives), shading and seduced wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo is not used to treat infections, which were detectable or probably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo against this type of infections may not be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be applied in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years may not exceed 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to the treatment two to three days, the doctor should reexamine the patient further examination and alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of bacteria cell where proteins are produced) and inhibits the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main Indicator of the efficacy was in all five studies of the patients whose infection was denied after the end of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin wounds, Altargo and Cefalexin similar to response: when the results were taken together with skin wounds, about 90% of both groups were treated for the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">However, in these two trials, however, Altargo was found in the treatment of wastes (failed cavity in body tissue) or of infections, which were detectable or probably caused by MRSA, not effective enough.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) is a irritation of the order.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Etargo (CHMP) Committee became the conclusion that the benefits of Altargo is in short-time treatment of the subsequent surface treatment of the following superficial skin attacks against the risks: • Impetigo, • infected small insights, eliminable or inclined wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Ltd. an approval for the placing of Altargo in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">The patients, in which there is no improvement in cases within two to three days, should not be considered once and an alternative therapy is considered (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the case of sensizing or heavy local Irritation through the application of Retapamulin Salbe, the treatment should be carefully wiped and an adequate alternative therapy of the infection began.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin is not to be applied to the treatment of infections, for which MRSA is known as pathogen is known or assumed (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical studies, the efficacy of Retapamulin in patients with infections, which were caused by methicillin-resistant sthylococcus aureus (MRSA), insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy is considered to be considered if after 2 to 3-day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected place occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of Retapamulin and other topical means on the same skin area is not examined and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma concentration, which were achieved in people after topical use on shielded skin or infected superficial wounds, a clinical-relevant inhibition could not be expected in vivo (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After a continuous gift of 2 times daily 200 mg of ketoconazol, the mean Retapamulin (0-24) and Cmax according to topical application of 1% Retapamulin Salbe fell to the poor skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure of topical application in patients, dose adjustments cannot be kept necessary when topical Retapamulin is applied during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive medicine after oral intake and are inadequate in relation to a statement on the birth and the föttale / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should only be applied during pregnancy, if a topical antibacterial therapy is clear, and the application of Retapamulin is preferable in an systemic antibiotic treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In case of decision whether the breastfeeding is continued / terminated or the therapy with altargo is expected to be completed between the benefit of a standstill for the infant and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical studies in 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, the Altargo had applied, the most frequently reported side effects of Irritation at the administration of the administration, which concerned about 1% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Effects of Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivatives of pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation in Clitopilus passeederianus (formerly Pleurotus passeederianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The action mechanism of Retapamulin is based on selective inhibiting of bacterial protein synthesis on interaction in a certain binding point in the 50s subunit of the bacterial Ribosom, which differs from the ashes of other ribosomal interantibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data show that the bonds of the ribosomales protein L3 is involved in the ribosomal P-binding point and the Peptide transferred centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Through liaison to this binding point pleuromutiline transferred the peptidylation, block partially P-binding interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">In case of the local prevalence of the resistance of the resistor value of Retapamulin at least some infectious forms should appear, an advice should be targeted by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in in-vitro activity of Retapamulin compared to S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In the case of a failure to treat the treatment in S.aureus, the presence of tribes with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults has been 1% Retapamulin Salbe per day under occlusion and applied on Snap skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children), who received 1% Retapamulin Salbe twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary traumatic wounds, single plasma robs were gained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">Rehearsal was performed on days 3 or 4 in adult patients each before the mediation and in children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic recording at people after topical application of 1% salbe on 200 cm2 shielded skin (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660 times lower than the Retapamulin IC50 for the PGP Hemp.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The Metabolism in vitro oxidative metabolism in human liver microsomes was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, taking part in CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies for oral toxicity of rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg) that were carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroeconomic changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In vitro review to gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse-lymphoma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in rats-microcore testing of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There was neither in male nor with female rats for genital fertility in oral dosing of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, thus reaching up to 5 times higher exposure has been achieved as the highest estimated exposure of human beings (topical application on 200 cm2).</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxical study of rats were given at oral doses of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (according to the ≥ 3-fold of the estimated human exposure (see above)), development toxicity (reduced body weight and delayed Ossification) and maternal toxicity.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases related to liver) in children between one and 15 years, which are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is applied in the context of one from two doses existing, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may be achieved only after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix may only be used when the immunisation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection, and ensured that the vaccination plan can be led out of two doses.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresh dose against hepatitis A or B is preferred, Ambirix or other hepatitis A- or -B vaccine will be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines work by stimulating the immune system (the natural Able of the body), "as it can defend itself against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Once a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface antigens as "foreign" and produces antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix includes the same components as the vaccine Twinrix Children since 1996 and the vaccine Twinrix Children since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are being applied to the protection against the same diseases, however, Twinrix Adults and Twinrix Children administered in the context of one from three doses existing.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data that supports the application of Twinrix adults, also used as a cover for the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main Indicator for the effectiveness was the proportion of imminated children, which had developed a protective anti-physical concentration after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine is compared to a six-month and a 12 month distance between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix introduced a month after the final injection of the antibody against hepatitis A and B between 98% and 100% of the vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambirix was similar to a six-month distance between the injections was similar.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common adverse events of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, appetite, pain on injection point, redness, matrix (fatigue) as well as friction.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not react to the molecular entities (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other parts or Neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002 the European Commission granted GlaxoSmithKline Biologetic. an approval of the placing of Ambirix in the entire</seg>
<seg id="2739">The Standardimtimetable for the Grundimentation with Ambirix consists of two vaccines, whereby the first dose is given at the date of choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a table runs for hepatitis A as well as for hepatitis B, it can be vaccinated with the respective monovalent vaccines or with a combination of combination.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B anti-hepatitis (anti-HAV) anti-hepatitis B anti-hepatitis (anti-HAV) anti-hepatitis B anti-hepatitis (anti-HAV) antichment values are in the same size as after vaccination with the respective monovent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not fully secured whether immunity persons who have been addressed to an hepatitis-A- vaccination, since they possibly have no longer detectable anti-antibodies by the immune memory.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As all injures are required for the rare case of anaphylactic reaction, according to the gift of the vaccination of vaccination and monitoring will always be available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a faster protection against hepatitis B is needed, the standard dimplscheme is recommended, the 360 ELISA units formalinactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In case of hematalysis patients and persons with disturbances of the immune system, an anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibody being achieved, so in these cases the gift of further vaccines may be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since an intraocular injection or intramuscular administration could lead to the gluteal muscles, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">According to Thrombozytopenia or blood disorders, Ambirix can be injected as an exception, as it can come to intramuscular administration in these cases.</seg>
<seg id="2748">When Ambirix was administered in the form of a separate injection, Tetanus-, azellular Pertussis-, activated poliomyelitis, inactivated poliomyelitis, inactivated poliomyelitis, or Haemophilus, was the immune response to all antigens (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients under immunomressive therapy or patients with immune defects must be assumed that no sufficient immune response is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study that has been carried out with 3 vaccines of these formulations in adults, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, headache, headache, headache, headache, headache, headache and preservative vaccine formulating was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 vaccines Ambirix were administered at a total of 1027 impregnation at the age of 1 to 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 and including 15 years, the tolerability of Ambirix was compared with the 3-doses-combined transport material.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and matrix on a calculation basis per vaccination of Ambirix, but not on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the administration of Ambirix at 50.7% of the subjects compared with 39.1% in the test according to the gift of a dose of 3 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2755">According to the complete vaccination cycle we reported 66.4% of the subjects who had given Ambirix were vaccinated over pain, compared with 63.8% of the subjects who had been vaccinated with the 3-dose.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of Matcha was comparable to a subject (i.e. about the total vaccination cycle at 39,6% of the subjects, which received Ambirix, compared with 36.2% in the subjects who received the 3-doses-compound.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The prevalence of distinct pain and matter was small and comparable, which was observed after administration of the combination-material with the 3-doses-vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparison study with 1 to 11 years of imflattens, the occurrence of local reactions and general actions was comparable to the ambikini group with 360 ELISA units formalinactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">However, for the 6 to 11- year old, however, after vaccination with Ambirix, a frequency of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not per subject, reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The share of imflore, who reported over heavy side effects during the 2-cans vaccines with 360 ELISA- units formalinactivated Hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B, was statistically significant not different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical studies that were carried out with Impairrings at the age of 1 to 15 years were the serum-conversion rates for anti-HAV 99.1% one month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second, to the month 6 (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The serum conversion rates for anti-HBS were 74.2% one month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second, to the month 6 (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study, which was carried out at 12- to including 15-year-old, received 142 two cans of Ambirix and 147 the standard combinations with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 persons whose immunity was valuable, the seroprotance rates (SP in the table below) were significantly higher than associated with Ambirix, in the table below 2 and 6.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune response in a clinical comparison study was reached in 1 to 11-year-old one month after the completion of the full vaccine series (i.e., in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies the imminers received either a 2-cans vaccination with Ambirix or a 3-doses-vaccination with 360 ELISA units formalinactivated hepatitis B virus and 10µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In persons who were aged 12 to 15 years old, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies took over at least 24 months after immunisation with ambirix which can be detected in the 0-6 months vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2768">This study observed immunologic reaction against both antigens was comparable to vaccination with a combination of 360 ELISA units, consisting of 360 ELISA units formalinactivated Hepatitis- A-virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study in 12- to including 15-year-olds could be shown that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies are comparable 24 months after immunisation in the 0-6 months vaccine is comparable to that in the 0-12 months vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2770">When the first dose of Ambirix was administered at the same time with the collection of a combined diphic, tetanusorem, inactivated poliomyelitis and 8 Haemophilus (DTPa-IPV / Hib), or with the first dose of a combined masons mumps vaccine, the immune response was sufficient for all antigens.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study carried out with 3 doses of current formulation in adults showed the current formulation of similar seroprotors and serum conversion rates as for the former formulation.</seg>

<seg id="2793">If Ambirix should be given at the same time or shortly before or after injection of Immunoglobbies, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be adequate.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Usually Ambirix pregnant or lactating women are not given, except it is urgently required to be vaccinated with hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B.</seg>
<seg id="2795">Important Information about certain other features of Ambirix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Neomycin (antibiotic) in case of you / your child.</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs of 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Based on the data, which has become known since the approval of the first approval for placing on the market, the CHMP grants positive opinion that the benefit-risk ratio for Ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since Ambirix was installed only in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available security data for this medicine is limited to small patient exposition.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonites can also be used at the age of over a month with incomplementary enzymes or with hyperammonic Encephalopathy (brain damage due to high ammonium concentration) in its history.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonites is administered - split by several single doses (meals), mixed by food or via a Gastrustomial (through the abdominal to the stomach's leading hose) or a noblonde (due to the nose into the stomach's leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">This was not a comparative study because the children of Ammon could not be compared to any other treatment or placebo (a drug medicine, i.e. without active ingredient).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonites can also lead to appetite, a abnormal acidity, scalability, headache, headache, flavours, flavours, flavours, nausea, constipation, skin rash or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The EU Committee on Human Rights (CHMP) came to conclude that Ammonites were effectively prevented in patients with disturbances of the urinary cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Ammonites was approved under "extraordinary circumstances" because of the rarity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information about this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indexed in all patients with a complete enzyme (within the first 28 life days).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late-manifold form (uncomplete enzyme, which manifests itself after the first life of life), there is an indication for use when in the history of a hyperammonic Encephalopathy.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For babies, for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with sucking disorders is AMMONAPS also available in granulatform.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose may be calculated individually for the protein tolerance and the development of daily intake of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to the previous clinical experiences the normal daily dose sodium phenylbutyrate: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13,0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Patients who suffer from an early manifold deficiency of Carbamylphosphate or Ornithintransponder bamylase, is necessary to be substitution of Citylin or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with ararginosuccinoma deficiency need to preserve arginine in a dosage of 0,4-0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15,4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be given to patients with strokes, as a risk for the emergence of Ösophagusulcera, if the tablets do not reach immediately in the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, equivalent to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, equivalent to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">Therefore, AMMONAPS should therefore be applied with congestive heart failure or severe cardiac insufficiency as well as with sodium resignation and oil formation only with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since Metabolism and deposition of sodium phenylbutyrat is carried out over the liver and the kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be applied with liver or kidney failure, only with the first caution.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results in terms of pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contra-indicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In subcutaneous utilisation of phenylacacetate to young rats at a high dosage (190 - 474 mg / kg), it came to a slowdown of neuronal deterioration and an increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed maturation of herebrals synapses and a reduced number of working nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of the brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be noted whether phenylacacetate is eliminated when humans in the breast milk is avoided, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS is contra-indexed during the standtime (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, at least 56% of patients showed at least one unwanted event (AE) and 78% of these unwanted events were assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 10), often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anodisktatic patient, which developed a metabolic Encephalopathy in conjunction with Lakutazir, severe hypokalemia, Panzytopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of an overdosage occurred with a 5 month old little child with an accidental single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms proceed with the accumulation of phenylacacetate, which showed an intravenous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day a dossier of neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacacetate is a metabolic active compound, which is conjugated by acetylate glutamine in glutamine glutamine by the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Stöchiometrically, phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both couplings contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as a alternative carrier for deposition of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disturbances of the urinary cycle can be assumed to be produced for each gram of sodium phenylbutyrat between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is of importance that the diagnosis is early, and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival opportunities and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early-shaped form of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in newborns was formerly almost always infant, and the disease was in treating treatment with peritonealdialysis and essential amino acids or with their sticked free analysts within the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By hematalysis, the utilisation of alternative ways of nitric deposition (Sodium phenylbutyrat), proteiny Kost and possibly substitution of essential amino acids, it was possible to increase the survival rate in postpartal (but within the first of life) diagnosed diseases to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy, the survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients the survival rate was with many as many as mental disabilities or other neurological deficiencies.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Patients with a late-shaped form of the disease (including female patients with heterozygotes form of the Ornithintransponder bamylase-Mangels), which were treated by a hyperammonic Encephalopathy form and treated permanently with sodium phenylbutyrat and a protective reduction diet was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversibly in treatment and with some patients a further deterioration of neurologic function can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyal is oxidized to phenylacate, which is conjugated in the liver and kidneys with glutamine, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its Metabolites in plasma and urine were determined according to the gift of a single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in sores healthy adults and patients with liver cirrhosis, which was determined as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (non-controlled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrat and its metabolism was also studied in cancer patients with intravenous gift of sodium phenylbutyrat (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in tablet form, 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma concentration of phenylbutyrat were determined.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients suffering from urinary cycles or hemoglobins (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) on the next morning, no phenylacate was detectable in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three of six patients with liver cirrhosis, which were treated with sodium phenylbutyrat (20 g / day oral in three single doses), the medium phenylacetate concentrations in Plasmaspque were five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">The medication is extracted within 24 hours to about 80-100% of the conjugated product phenylacetylate glutamine by the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of the Micronucleus test, sodium phenylbutyrat had no clastogenic effects (investigation 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS Granules is either orally taken (infant and children who can't swallow tablets, or patients with strokes) or via a rustproof dish or a noblonde.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to the previous clinical experiences the normal daily dose sodium phenylbutyrate: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13,0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (in particular branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">Patients who suffer from an early manifold deficiency of Carbamylphosphate or Ornithintransponder bamylase, is necessary to be substitution of Citylin or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS Granules contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyrat, equivalent to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, equivalent to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When Rattendles were exposed to the birth phenylacacetate (active metelit by phenylbutyrat), there came to lesions in the pyramid of the cranial container.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anodisktatic patient, which developed a metabolic Encephalopathy in conjunction with Lakutazir, severe hypokalemia, Panzytopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Stöchiometrically, phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both couplings contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as a alternative carrier to eradication of excess</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of investigations on the expulsion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disturbances of the urinary cycle can be assumed that for each gram, sodium phenylbutyrat can be produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible in treatment, and in some patients a further deterioration of neurological state may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in granulatform, 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma concentration of phenylbutyrat were determined.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of the durability, the patient can use the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">With this approach, the small measuring spoon 0.95 g, the average measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon of 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient needs to obtain the medicine via a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrat amounts up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver enzymes are missing, so that they can not excrete to consumption of proteins in the body.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If the laboratory tests are carried out, you must tell the doctor that you may take AMMONAPS, because sodium phenylbutyrat may affect the results of certain laboratory studies.</seg>
<seg id="2866">When taking AMMONAPS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other medicines, or recently, even if it is not prescribed for prescription medicinal products.</seg>
<seg id="2867">During a standstill time, you cannot take AMMONAPS, as the medicine could be overflowing with your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases, turbulence, headache, flavours, variability, disinterity, memory disorders and deterioration of existing neurological states were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2869">If you notice one of these symptoms, you immediately put yourself with your doctor or with the emergency absorption of your hospital for introduction of an appropriate treatment in connection.</seg>
<seg id="2870">If you forgot the ingestion of AMMONAPS, take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is applied for the treatment of adult patients with "acute coronage synthesis (ACS, reduced blood vessels (a form of pain in the chest basket with different strength) or myocardial infarction (cardiac disease) without" ST- Hebung "(a anomalous measurement value at the electrocardiograph or EKG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">Angioxox is used to prevent blood clots in patients receiving one PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">In patients with angina or cardiac arrhea, this can contribute to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS at all with a glycoprotein-IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI) which was compared with conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another anticoagulans) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI, the patients frequently used a stent (a short tube, which in the arterial remains to prevent a closure), and they received additional medicines for preventing blood clots, such as Abciximab and Aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS was angiox - with or without gift of GPI - at preventing the new events (deaths, heart failure or revolascularisation) after 30 days or a year in total as usual for conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who undergo a PCI was angiox in terms of all indicators as well as Heparin, except for severe bleeding, where it was significantly more effective than Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be applied to patients, possibly oversensitive (allergic) against Bivalirudin, other miludine or one of the other parts.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It also may not be applied to patients who had a blast of blood, as well as with a strong hypertension or severe kidney problems or a heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Medicines Committee (CHMP) came to the conclusion that angiox during the treatment of ACS and a PCI is an acceptable replacement for Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the Company The Medicines Company UK Ltd. an approval for the placing of angiox in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronardedromes (instabile Angina / non-ST-Hebrides (IA / NSTEMI) in case of an emergency case or when an early intervention is foreseen.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of angiox in patients with ACS is a intravenous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a PCI option is carried out in a row, an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be increased and the infusion for the duration of the intervention is increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">After the PCI service requirements, the reduced infusion dose ranges from 0.25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately before the procedure, a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg is administered, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of angiox in patients with one PCI consists of an initial intravenous bolt of 0.75 mg / kg of body weight and a subsequent intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of an alline Bolus gift of angiox was not examined and is not recommended even when a short PCI intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened under 225 seconds, a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / bodyweight should be charged.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the appearance of lower ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted medicine was carefully mixed before application, and the Bolusdose rapidly administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">Once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, another monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Patients with moderate renal restriction (GFR 30-59 ml / min) which are subjected to one PCI (whether with bivalent irudin against ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT value is below 225 seconds, a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is sufficient to increase the ACT 5 minutes after the second wrist dose.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate renal damage caused by the Phase III- PCI study (Replace-2), which were included in the approval, the ACT value was 5 minutes after the gift of the Bivalirudin-Bolus with no dose adaption at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 For patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also in dialysis patients, angiox is contra-indicated (see section 4.3).</seg>

<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially when Bivalirudine is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even when using PCI-patients under Bivalirudin most hemortions of arterial puncture devices, patients who undergo out of a percutaneous coronarintervention (PCI), during the treatment principle you may occur anywhere.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients treated with Warfarin and treated with Bivalirudin, a monitoring of INR-Werts (International normalized ratio) should be considered to ensure that the value of treatment with bivalirudin is again achieved in front of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Starting from the knowledge about the effects of anti-coagulants (Heparin, Warfarin, Thrombolytics or Thrombozyńsk) may be assumed that these substances may increase blood risk.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In combination of Bivalirudin with Thrombocytic aggregates or anti-coagulants are the clinical and biological hemostasis parameters in any case regularly.</seg>

<seg id="2912">4612 were randomized to Bivalirudin alone, 4604, were randomized to Bivalirudin plus GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor and 4603 were randomized to either unfracturing Heparin or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Both in the Bivalirudin group as well as in patients treated with Heparin groups, women and patients with more than 65 years were more common to adverse events than with male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleeding were defined in accordance with ACUITY and Timi Measures for heavy bleeding as defined in Table 2.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and severe bleeding stood under Bivalirudin alone significantly less frequently than in groups with Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa-inhibitor plus GPIIb / IIIa- Inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intraocular hemorrhage or bleeding in the puncture sector that required a radiographic or surgical intervention, reduction of hemoglobinaries of ≥ 3 g / dl with a known blood level, cataract due to a blood of blood, use of blood products to transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Further, less frequently observed blood samples which stood at more than 0.1% (occasionally), were "other" puncture set, retroperitoneal, roasting, ear, nose or neck.</seg>

<seg id="2923">Angiox contains Bivalirudin, a direct and specific Thrombinocor, which is located at Catalytic Center as well as to the anionic acid region of Thrombin, regardless of whether thrombin is bound in the liquid phase or in tinnsel.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The Binding of Bivalirudin at Thrombin, and with its effect, is reversible, because Thrombin sails to split the Binding of Bivalirudin-Arg3-Pro4, so the function of the active centre of thrombin regenerated.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Moreover, by Bivalirudine, with serum of patients, in which there was come to heparininduced Thrombozytopenia / heparininduced Thrombosis syndrome (HIT / HITTS), no Thrombolic-reaction reaction was induced.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used for treating adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes that require a treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is injected subcutaneous (under the skin) in the abdominal wall, injected thighs or upper arm with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not process sufficient insulin to control the glucose level (sugar) in the blood or the insulin is not effective.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin pisins distinguishes itself very marginally of human insulin, and the change means that it works faster and shorter activity as a short-term human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was used in combination with a long-term insulin-type insulin in combination with type 1 diabetes, where the body does not produce insulin, in two trials with a total of 1 549 adults and included in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In case of type 2 diabetes, Apidra has been investigated in a study with 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main Indicator for the effectiveness was the change of the concentration of the substance glykosylized hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that shows how good blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study in adults with type 1 diabetes, a decrease of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) in comparison to a total lowering of 0.14% at insulin pisan.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the decrease of HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra in comparison to 0.30% for human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be applied to patients that are possibly oversensitive (allergic) against insulin-insulin or one of the other parts, or in patients who suffer from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The cans of Apidra may need to be adjusted if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood-glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH to approval by Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is available as subcutaneous injection either in the section of abdominal wall, or to apply or subcutaneous to continuous infusion in the area of abdominal loading.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced happiness capacity and reduced insulin delivery, the insulin demand may be reduced in patients with a limitation of liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Every change of active strength, the brand (Her- Steller), the insulin (normal, NPH, zinge delay, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the production method can move a change in insulin demand.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 A inadequate dosage or breakdown of treatment, especially in patients with a insulin-dependent diabetes, may lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoazir; these states are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The changeover of one patient on another insulin type or insulin should be made under stringent medical supervision and may require a change of dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The timing of a hypoglycaemia depends on the efficiency profile of the used insulin. therefore, the change of treatment schemes can therefore change.</seg>
<seg id="2983">Substances that increase the blood glucose activity and increase the inclination to hypoglycemic acid (ACE) inhibitors, discopyramid, fibrate, Fluoxetine, monoamine oxidation, propoxyphar, propoxyphate, salicylates, and sulphide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, symptoms can be weakened or missing under the effect of sympathizers, Clonidin, Guanethidin and Reserpin the symptoms of adversaries.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimental studies for reproductive medicine showed no differences between insu- linglulisin and human insulin in terms of pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, the birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin is overlap in human breast milk, but in general, insulin is generally transferred to breast milk, nor is resorally absorbed by oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Listed below are listed for clinical trials, grouped according to system quality (very frequent: ≥ 1 / 100; &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000); very rare (frequency based on cell phones data not checked).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold-welding, cool and blasse skin, fatigue, nervousness or treaches, anxiety, cursor, dizziness, excessive dog, excessive dog, headache, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy will be missed, to change the injection of injection within the injection index, may occur in a row a Lipodystrophy at the injection station.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Heavy hypoglycemesis with consciousness can be treated by means of intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucose (0.5 to 1 mg), which is given by an intravenous person or treated by a doctor's intravenous gift.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a glucose monitoring, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the primary cause for the heavy hypoglycemia and avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose (particular by skeletal musculature and fat) as well as the inhibition of the glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in subcutaneous gain of insulin-insulin-effects occur faster and the duration of life is shorter than at hu- manem normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study of 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes, insulin showed insulin-relevant dosing range from 0,075 to 0.15 E / kg, a proportional flow of gluing effects, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a proportional increase in gluing effects, exactly like human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin-insulin has twice as fast efficiencies as usual human insulin and achieves the full-glued effect of about 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">The data was evident that during a application of insulin injisisin 2 minutes before meal a comparable post-postoperative glycemic control is achieved as with human normal levels, which is 30 minutes before meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">If the insulin was charged 2 minutes before meal, insulin was performed better than with human normal levels, which was given 2 minutes before meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin takes 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal, a comparable glycemic control is achieved as with human normal levels, which is given 2 miths before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin delivery in a gift of 2 minutes before the onset of meal in comparison to human normal levels, which was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min) before the beginning of the meal (Figure 1A) as well as compared to human normal levels, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin delivery in gift of 15 minutes (GLULISIN - after the beginning of the meal in comparison to human normals, which was 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the beginning of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
