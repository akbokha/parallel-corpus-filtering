the pec@@ uli@@ arity of &amp; fs@@ view ; insi@@ sted that displays the size of objects in missing structures . each object is represented by a rectangle , whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the sub@@ ordin@@ ate objects of an object must be smaller or equal to the size of the object .
with &amp; fs@@ view , reflects the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of a folder is set to be specified . in this way , large files can be detected , even if they can be seen far below in the folder . according to that , &amp; fs@@ view can be considered as a graphic and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you see .
in &amp; fs@@ view ; is an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap representation a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your file system . to simpli@@ fy navigation possess the rec@@ tan@@ gles of practical colour and labelling .
the color of a rectangle that is switched on with color mode , either depth for easy detection of the dis@@ appearance or picture of another file , such as name , owners , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rectangle can be lab@@ elled with different characteristics of the corresponding file or folder . for each feature you can determine if it is at all , only if there is enough space for display , or if the surface of sub@@ ordin@@ ate sp@@ lin@@ ers should be used . so you can specify the relative position of labelling on the rectangle below .
when performing algorith@@ ms for Tre@@ em@@ ap , the surface is proportional to keep the surface is proportional to the size of the entry , and this purpose is not always observed . you will see that less space for the frame is lost when the rectangle is square .
as a distribution of the area of a single entry for the subject @-@ in entries , the implementation will be over@@ flowing through the implementation and to avoid placement of space loss due to as always advant@@ age@@ ous areas that are as possible as possible . the best methods on these are lines , columns or Rek@@ ur@@ sive second release .
you can define the minimal area for an entry via the menu entry . instead , a pir@@ ate pattern is drawn into the area of the superior entry , to display that this area is actually assigned by an appropriate entry .

what is a digital data management - away from the fashion word ? digital data management considers every part of the process that has been sc@@ anned up to the final issue and the permanent storage . each of the photos will be sc@@ anned or digital photos stores a form of digital data management . most of us do not make this in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , find a plan and practical tips like you can back up , protect and use photos . we consider the procedure for digital photograph@@ ers who use &amp; digi@@ plug . we consider downloading , ren@@ ame , evaluate , evalu@@ ating , optim@@ ate , optim@@ isation , waiting , waiting and export of image files .
&amp; quot ; digital data management takes up , inde@@ xed , categorized , sec@@ ures , trans@@ duc@@ ed , conf@@ ected , conf@@ ected and exported content that would be an mon@@ ary or cultural value .
met@@ ad@@ ata are defined as data on data . met@@ ad@@ ata are provided in accordance with your definition data , information on or documentation of other data provided by application or environment .
I d@@ ump@@ ed to claim when you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you don &apos;t want to know how many photos you have , then do not use &amp; digi@@ plug ; . approach the met@@ ad@@ ata to save in a database as well as in the image files , very fast search and secure archi@@ ving that you can access other programs , platforms and formats .
the first you need and know what you need to set up in your system is the structure information structure in contrast to the data structure . you need to decide if you want to save your photos on your computer , or on a network drives &amp; etc ; make sure that you need to switch to a bigger drive .
maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly over your location . if you &apos;re on the same place . if you want to organize enough photos , then you will use sub @-@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; use . export is then a folder for images that can print or publish on a web site .
professional photograph@@ ers have other requirements such as ver@@ sion@@ ing photos , archi@@ ving , working processes , constant supply of pictures to different themes and a large number of all . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % work files will not want to re@@ organise your structure for this content .
what types of files are fit together ? the separation of file types makes the stack processing easier . split new of old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies the backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived image .
we also recommend to save the met@@ ad@@ ata option to activate . this is sure that exc@@ use and IP@@ TC data can be written in the file . if you forget it , then you can save the met@@ ad@@ ata from the database in the files by select the corresponding items in the menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what ? add &amp; digi@@ came ; them a met@@ ad@@ ata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important .
now the real work starts because you should select every photo sample , labelling and an evaluation . of course you can select all images that you want to select the same attri@@ bute and start the value . this makes sense when you can focus on the best photos on the best photos .
let us now be hot , keywords , key@@ word or categories as well as in other programs . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import@@ ing catal@@ og@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then add &amp; digi@@ plug ; automatically add the tree to the correct place . that surro@@ unds the hier@@ archy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by using a sub @-@ tree to another . the changed stit@@ utes will be prosec@@ uted by &amp; digi@@ ous ; updated while there is sub @-@ trees .
the graphics shows how different met@@ ad@@ ata cutting themselves . this is a very rough representation because each block of met@@ ad@@ ata exists from many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all images .
enough of the stit@@ ch - the next section refers to labels or comments , the third important tool to catal@@ og@@ ate your met@@ ad@@ ata .
most of them don &apos;t want to watch your photos simply , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photograph@@ ers and agencies . they are certainly interested in your photos .
check out this panorama . from the distance is not even a nice beach panorama . if you look closer , then start to see some details , people , space .
and now I tell you these of the landing area of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after the landing . Wow ! one starts to dream , memories , the historical period is again present , you may perhaps hear your perception of this panorama .
for other those who consider your photos are the title possibly more important than the picture itself to create a story . remember that the key is to transfer Him to help Him to understand about the motive you have to understand what you understand .
it &apos;s okay if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only with a labelling for itself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ plug ; you can also store a lot of text in an international@@ ised alp@@ habet ( UTF @-@ 8 ) , then you can use it for a selection of images at the same time . if you have to export your images in Web galleries , then you will need to tell you the story for a second time .
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find a different city without navigation system ? was it not a bor@@ ing planet in front of goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train de@@ parts of the spatial presentation now already with light speed .
the possibilities can use the ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ alisation . I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your travels with geographical data . you can also export the photos at the recording location . you can also view the photos at the recording location . you can also export the photos to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with goo@@ gle@@ Maps viewer .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and den@@ otes the practice of cop@@ y@@ rights to remove restrictions on distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms also apply to all amended versions , so also for the work of others .
the following description tells you what information is provided in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ came ; as information can be deposited :
author ( syn@@ onym for replacement and author ) : this field should add your name , or the name of the person who has created the photo . if it is not desired to protect the name of photograph@@ ers , then the name of a company or organisation may not be changed . according to this value , it should not be changed once again . this field does not support semi @-@ Sem@@ icon@@ ol@@ ons as a separ@@ ator .
Aut@@ onomy ( syn@@ onymous with the author ) : associated with the author . this field contains the work drawing of photograph@@ ers . examples of this field can be the title as : employee photographer , free work photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a mem@@ o to the authorization field , this is also being filled out .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider to identify the photo . if the photographer is working for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press , then these organisations can be listed here if the image is a stock photo , then the image will offer the image here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright action , although they do not provide protection against mis@@ use . each of which is a little more than base @-@ party met@@ ad@@ ata , delete or change . the solution for this problem are digital water@@ marks . for individuals , this protection is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and half professionals , this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique in each picture . &amp; digi@@ plug ; in the near future , a module for stack processing is available .
subjects : record error , record loss , power switch , EC@@ C , transmission error , age@@ ing of storage media , rest@@ oring , redund@@ ancy , life time , temperature , data size , widespread super@@ st@@ itions
of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire . those kind of losses are the same that you can also pass in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section it is about problems with the so @-@ called New Media .
K@@ roll On@@ track , the largest data recovery company in the world , has some interesting statistics which has a loss of data loss .
to combat the problem of CDs / DVDs to fight these pre @-@ c@@ auti@@ ous experience , you can also live longer than a few years . of course you can also receive CDs and DVDs in archive quality . there are offers of gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for itself . if you believe it is in your discretion .
CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable , but you can use this risk in which you use good dis@@ ks and good recording devices . the best DVD capture devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest ones , but you write much reliable . it rot@@ ates the correct select .
CDs and DVDs are very vulner@@ able for mist@@ akes , even if you are just written . therefore , they use a control mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for form@@ att@@ ing and control sum@@ s . despite this massive protection it causes them through chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ;
for def@@ ective CDs and DVDs there is a useful program called I@@ so@@ B@@ uster through Windows and Linux ; but is not available for Mac@@ s . there is also similar applications that damaged data from damaged disks , hard disks , Flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to store the format war against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all about CDs and DVDs was naturally also true for the Blu @-@ ray disc .
burn slowly with a good start @-@ to @-@ quality media in a no propri@@ etary format . also read the media with a description , date &amp; author number and afterwards protected in a clean , dark dry and on animals protected site . do not forget to copy the data on the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware and software that can read this media .
Disk@@ manufacturer retain your statistics for themselves . their manufacturers guarantees a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives : dis@@ missing
in brief , Dis@@ ks hold fast when you are operated in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. For lower temperature applications , SM@@ ART can &apos;t notice these errors . some of SM@@ ART provided errors do not cancel the im@@ pending failure . these are particular reading and re@@ iter@@ ation count . the expected lifetime of life is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete losses due to over@@ voltage . of course you can also have data loss due to a power loss before you have secured the files , but these losses may normally produce without great problems .
while most electric devices are not far too far , this anom@@ al@@ ies may take effect on devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processes . these anom@@ al@@ ies may cause serious data loss , hard@@ copy age , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . protect themselves from in@@ ev@@ itable to a loss of time and money .
the most widespread protection against power points is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs a portion of energy heat absor@@ bs and the rest . it is usually in the form of a plug @-@ in strip , but remember that any connector bar also contains an over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should make sure that he offers the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also make sure that it protects protection against flash , and thus protects the correctly connected devices .
since there is an over@@ voltage of each cable to your computer , you should also make sure that all the periph@@ er@@ als can be connected to your system . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage support and also include a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connectivity options for co@@ axial cable of the cable modems and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , then you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are designed specifically for not@@ eb@@ ooks , therefore also very small and you also contain the protection for the modem . so you are ideal for traveling .
while over@@ voltage protection your system is used before smaller fluctu@@ ations in the power lines it will not really help you . even a failure of a few seconds can result in the loss of adverse data . it may be sen@@ sible in a interrup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to protection against over@@ voltage , these devices allow you to save up to the power . some models allow you even further to work up to the current . if you purchase a US@@ V , you should be sure that they are the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the enclosed software is interesting .
consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its safety with the costs to avoid this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can get up to &amp; euro ; 20 . this is only a small price difference if you &apos;re thinking about how well your calcul@@ ator is thus protecting . at the end you should always think all cable to drive you into the holiday .
the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can use this as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as the backup destination for your software . Google Sh@@ ared Storage is another popular offer that allows you to save any quantities of data .
as compared to the hard drives , they are very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you need to send data about the compar@@ atively long @-@ term Internet .
the solutions are therefore only a solution against a local data loss of the most important pictures . this is not a bad solution , but there is no general backup solution . therefore it is too slow .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are available on photos . their free memory is limited to 1 GB . the professional version offers you more at your disposal , in case of Fli@@ ck@@ r dramatic more . for $ 25 per year you get un@@ limited memory , which should be reviewed in reality .
from the point of view of the data backup , the web solutions are very secure . transmission errors will be automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and with the large companies are included in the offer a backup and a distribution memory . thus they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ ably .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in calcul@@ ator . all trans@@ missions are an@@ sus@@ cep@@ tible to transmission errors . the fil@@ esystem and b@@ tr@@ fs represent at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk .
the worst thing is that no one has occurred when a transmission error occurred , not if this occurred in your hardware . all these dis@@ rup@@ tions remain un@@ discovered until you should have no protection . no one seems to have thought about it . nobody seems to have thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much more secure data away as being in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are a further source of transmission losses , as they generate inter@@ ferences within the data stream . with normal file systems this error remains un@@ noticed .
even if you are currently affected by transfers problems you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year .
Z@@ FS by Sun Mic@@ ros@@ ystems seems to be one of two candidates that can handle and highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GPL in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it is soon available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows available . read this article in English .
Oracle has launched an own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs system . this is still in alpha status . it uses the same protection mechanisms that is used and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate that these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss at not@@ ebook and 46 % at the workplace systems . if not@@ eb@@ ooks the percentage of th@@ iev@@ es is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less widespread than the most po@@ sten . it leads to a lower damage , as such as ste@@ els or re@@ install@@ ations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users know only very few viruses and under Linux ; there has been no longer been sigh@@ ted .
open source file systems are less sus@@ cep@@ tible to data loss as propri@@ etary systems : wrong , N@@ TF@@ S is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reis@@ er@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to find the common file systems . you can find a very good English article here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden inter@@ ruption during surgery is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . if a file was not completely saved before the problem was lost , it is lost .
viruses are the largest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 stops of fundamental physical limits . this is that while technology develops further , there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and rob@@ otic risks for all kinds of light sensors are no longer removed from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ apix@@ els sensors . even though this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result rather deterior@@ ates . even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 Megapixel . for higher resolutions , you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
a 750@@ GB hard disk will get you today for 100 &amp; euro ; so you do not get any other data loss for data loss . so , you save your data often according to a plan and test this backup before you make any more dangerous like the re@@ installation of your operating system , the exchange of plates or the size change of hard drives .
suppose you &apos;re assum@@ ing daily your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash one strikes you luck when the drive was not connected to the moment .
a disaster suggests locally and destro@@ ys a lot . do not forget aircraft accident : fire , water , electricity , children , and ste@@ els are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect an entire room or entire house .
therefore , disin@@ teg@@ ration always means a non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs into the neighboring house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of the physical separation : as shown above is a common reason for a data loss despite backup the pan@@ ic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files are to be secured . it is a mom@@ entary lap@@ se without hist@@ ori@@ ography and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential securing : the backup of files have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snap@@ shot at two time points : the complete backup and the last differentiation .
incre@@ mental securing : a backup of the files have been changed since the last backup . it allows the original status to restore the original status at any time . this backup comes to a ver@@ sion@@ ing system at the next time with the exception that it is only ab@@ sent and not continuously .
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that can easily configure your machines . in contrast to script @-@ controlled FTP sessions , or other types of file transfer@@ ring scripts , only the difference of files that have been really changed . this happens and if you want to increase safety through ss@@ h .
secure important pictures directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or another op@@ tically medium .
this approach will allow you plenty of time to discover and restore losses . at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly surcharge for at least one month and a moment for each month . any further expansion should be done manually after which you have done a complete review .
topics : met@@ ad@@ ata , stored in the picture file stored IP@@ TC information , editor , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ locate images and met@@ ad@@ ata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , ... , use of the Internet .
to survive valuable pictures the next 40 years , that is about the period in which you really interested in you are you interested in your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
since the future is un@@ predic@@ table because of your nature , everything is said to consider and re @-@ evaluate while the time flies . unfortunately , there is no other way to ask yourself as the current system back@@ wards . the less variants you have used in the past , the more easier is to evaluate the questions about the future .
this question should actually be answered using the explanations in this document . use and change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtualization is now available for everyone . if you have an old system , you will keep it for reading your images , then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for a later use .
on the other hand the Council is quite simple : every time when you change your computer architecture , your memory and secure file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard . stay at open standards .
scal@@ ability is the specialized print for the possibility to change a system in its size . this is actually enlarged .
let &apos;s go out that you have planning the scal@@ ability with entered and use the area you will increase to a dedicated disk or partition . in * nix systems such as &amp; Linux , you can copy this area and rely on a new record :
check the d@@ mes@@ g command if your new record is detected by the system , but do not depend on it .
&amp; dollar ; d@@ d if = / dev / S@@ DC # Source is / dev / S@@ DC / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; Size of the plate in MB@@ gt ; # works with ext@@ 2,3 , FAT@@ 16 , 32 and Reis@@ er@@ FS &amp; dollar ; resi@@ ze@@ 2@@ fs / dev / SM / 1 # change the size of Reis@@ er@@ FS if necessary
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if any time no software is able to read , then you can create these themselves . this task is easier from year to year easier .
GIF is a propri@@ etary format that dis@@ appears slowly from the market . you should not use it anymore .
PNG was designed to replace as an open source standard , but it can save much more . it is reliable , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC met@@ ad@@ ata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . PNG may have a lot of administration information , but not as many as TIFF needs and a slow compression ratio . this format we would like to save you to save your pictures .
TIFF was widespread as image format . TIFF can be saved in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a los@@ s@@ less compression algorithm . however , it is very large files . with some cameras you can custom@@ ize your images in this format . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digital neg@@ atives file format is a licensed and open @-@ screen format that has been developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on TIFF / EP format and is obliged to use met@@ ad@@ ata . it is now available to use met@@ ad@@ ata . a hand@@ ful camera manufacturer makes D@@ NG available now and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon also sometime .
this is possibly one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe uses its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology , to replace the &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ ad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a blend of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is allowed with the expansion &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; is stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photograph@@ ers prefer an original of your photo , mostly in the blank format . however , the met@@ ad@@ ata can be purchased separately from the image file and how it is indicated above , the raw format is split . therefore , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything here together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ ad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization that supports a wide range of usage purposes and business models . to the activities of D@@ C@@ MI communities , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and explan@@ atory efforts to achieve an extensive acceptance of met@@ ad@@ ata standards and practices .
import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long the images are on the camera dium , you can use it as temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save it in your raw repository . this function is not implemented yet .
for an host@@ ile processing , you can use external programs . if you want to edit the pictures again with &amp; digi@@ plug ; then you should add the met@@ ad@@ ata again . these were cut off using the other programs .
protect the mach@@ ined images for the copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them only in Web@@ Gall@@ eries , en@@ code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ plug ; in the section of adding photos to an album you can also add a description as you can already have on your hard drive , but the camera interface makes you many advanced settings for import@@ ing images to your Alb@@ end@@ aten@@ bank .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; connect these to the computer , turn off the camera to the display mode and switch it . another description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera , it tries to connect to your camera . if the connection is made , a distance indicator at the bottom end and the images of all photos on the camera will be displayed . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ames and a symbol of file order is displayed for each file , photos , movies , music , etc on the camera .
before you can download the photos on your computer , you may need to see the camera information about any entry . with the page features and met@@ ad@@ ata from the camera @-@ interface , you can see the properties of a single entry or its met@@ ad@@ ata .
this dialog shows file properties and the camera information that are internally saved from the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded on your computer . note that some digital cameras are not available to all information .
the rider met@@ ad@@ ata shows the internal met@@ ad@@ ata such as EX@@ IF , manufacturer att@@ aching , GPS etc . this information is the same as with the met@@ ad@@ ata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ plug ; or the image processing . note that these met@@ ad@@ ata are not available in some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is click to download and then download all photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ plug ; . when downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend you to download if the pictures are saved in an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can only select the desired option from &amp; k@@ de ; select the selected button and then select the selected button . the reset selection can be downloaded as long as you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this option is a new option available . these pictures have not been downloaded from &amp; digi@@ plug ; downloaded . in this case , the new pictures are selected with a star in preview window . if you select this option , only the new pictures are downloaded .
if you can download all of the buttons or select the selected album , a dialog appears that you can select the target album in which the photos are stored . details on folder records can be found in the section My albums . then choose the target album from the list and press OK .
after you selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ plug ; you can download the photos from the camera to the album .
as soon as you downloaded the desired photos , you can er@@ ase them from the camera by removing the Del@@ ete button . if you want to delete all your button , you &apos;ll need to select it at first and delete the delete selection .
note that there is no way to restore photos that you have been deleted from the camera . you should not check if the photos are successfully deleted from the camera . if you want to delete the camera you want to er@@ ase them . if you want to er@@ ase the camera of camera , you should make it much faster than that .
cameras use as fil@@ en@@ ames for photos often not especially meaning@@ ful names . this can result in double file names , if you can upload photos of different asc@@ ents into the same album , so it can be sen@@ sible , the date and time to integrate the image into the fil@@ en@@ ames .
in the next section you can find options for turning and mirrors of the picture and date based under@@ carriage . if you use this latter option , a folder will be created per day .
the options During the transfer will open three more options that are done before the photos stored on the plate . if you select this , the corresponding entries from the EX@@ IF data will be copied to the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures .
if you wish to use a different format format as standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % m@@ - % H : % M : % S . switch to this option date &amp; time . for further adjustments you should read the help of the command str@@ f@@ time .
if you are using the camera file names , you have the option to change fil@@ en@@ ames in lower@@ case or if you prefer to download this file names .
the new file name , the &amp; digi@@ plug ; for a photo , will be displayed below the name , which is stored in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming will be saved and automatically used when you open the camera window .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; can use all information on the orientation of the camera to run a automatic rotation during the shut@@ down . do not all the cameras are ready . in the section side@@ bar met@@ ad@@ ata you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is normally switched on , and if your camera does not supply this information , you can &apos;t use &amp; digi@@ plug ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic rotation , use the button and select the automatic rotation at the bottom of the window .
when your camera information is made available , you can use &amp; digi@@ plug ; this sub@@ lime is based on the picture data . all images with the same date will be loaded into the same sub @-@ album . not all cameras provide you to read what information can be embedded in the photos .
this option is normally switched off and in this case saves &amp; digi@@ plug ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this option , use this button and select the file @-@ based under@@ carriage at the bottom end of the window .
the easiest way to download photos from their calcul@@ ator to download is the button . then , in which you can select the files you want to be up@@ loaded . you can also select more than a file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , ask &amp; digi@@ came ; you where the images should be loaded high . select the folder selection dialog for the camera . choose the desired folder and press OK to start up@@ loading . the images are not deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Positi@@ oning System ) is used as general concept in this document . thus , a position is meant to be displayed in long@@ itude and lat@@ itude and which can be displayed on a map . identi@@ fying the data can be performed from the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European Galileo or any other system .
not only for professional photography , it is interesting to create a picture with a precise ge@@ ographic location . not everyone uses a plane in order to enh@@ ancing a field by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental plann@@ ers , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you forgot later , where exactly the photo was made , you can select the area that shows the area . if you want to select a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ plug ; users want to document the place of the photos , or just want to document this aspect , it is well the position data of a photos .
the question is how to come the GPS data into the image ? at first you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 lots of GPS data fields , such as the data into these fields , so there are at least three ways to reach this . directly with the right hardware , via a re@@ processing of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for the ge@@ ographic mapping ( manual ) and last about manual input of well @-@ known places .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated GPS unit . but there is a couple that works with GPS receivers . either as a map module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye iP@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ dak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ric@@ oh Pro G3 Sony
the download of GPS data from one device can be made with g@@ p@@ sman or g@@ p@@ sb@@ abel . you need to save these data in the GP@@ X format , as it is the only format that is supported by the module to ge@@ ographic mapping .
there are different programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract and cor@@ related data from images and from GPS . on the following page you can make the same under &amp; Linux ; g@@ p@@ s@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ p@@ s@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and lat@@ itude or other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the signs to be created , e.g. by m@@ ap@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
m@@ ap@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European street types . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , all the navigation data for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; tries to change the same settings as possible . there are many settings that you should change the behaviour of &amp; digi@@ plug ; you need to choose between these settings . you can switch between these settings . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left .
you can select this action to preview or start image processing . if you want the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ plug ; fixed if you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains as shown below , the Stand@@ ar@@ did@@ acy and technical data . these data will be selected automatically into the appropriate IP@@ TC data fields , if the option is selected for download from the camera code . also on a database synchron@@ isation , these data are written into the IP@@ TC fields .
Aut@@ ort@@ itel is a syn@@ onym for disc@@ o parts : this field should contain the professional name of the photographer . these can be drawings such as a photographer photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a closer description to the author , this also has to be filled .
editor is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to use the photo . this is not the author , if this organisations should be entered here as such as Reuters or Associated Press ; and if the image is a stock photo , then the group or agency must be shown here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data into the corresponding IP@@ TC rim . this ensures that the met@@ ad@@ ata are permanently contained in the picture and not only arrived in the database of &amp; digi@@ . these met@@ ad@@ ata are also available and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ ous ; they are imported without losing .
image certificates like embedded labels ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG pictures store : this synchron@@ izes the comments that you can read to your photos , with the images that can be read from other images . attention : for pictures , which include files , these can be viewed by the &amp; digi@@ plug .
the page settings includes all options for the information that appear when the mouse poin@@ ter in the main window over a file . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ came ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to determine which file types &amp; digi@@ came ; Alb@@ um@@ folder that has no such expan@@ sions is added , from &amp; digi@@ came ; igno@@ red .
the default settings can be returned once again by pressing the button on the right of each category .
the settings of the lumin@@ ance &amp; digi@@ plug ; can be set on this page on the default values . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . if you have one more images and the synchron@@ ous mode , you should only use quick computers . if you have one , then you can obtain better acceptance results .
by default , the image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can switch tool@@ bar if you use the image processing in full screen mode .
over@@ exposed and exposed areas of a picture can be marked with dar@@ ker or brigh@@ ter color in the picture . these colors are specified here . in the image processing , this picture mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma Sub@@ sampling it is meant that the images can be encoded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the colour information . please read this article in Wikipedia for the night statement .
with adjustment PNG compression , you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not require image quality because PNG requires a loss free algorithm . if you have a quick calcul@@ ator , you can set this value to a high compression . thereby , 1 : a low and 9 a high compression .
with the TIFF TIFF you can comp@@ ress the de@@ fl@@ ate algorithm for TIFF images . this reduces the size of TIFF images . it has no influence on image quality because the de@@ fl@@ ate algorithm is freely working .
with the adjustment @-@ free JPEG 2000 files you can save loss . even if you have posted the loss of quality and file size , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than at normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , met@@ ad@@ ata was not yet supported but was found in planning .
in the earlier versions of &amp; digi@@ came ; the image processing was only a picture viewer for photos . currently , it has evolved very quickly to a tool to manip@@ ulating your photos . with this dialog , you can change the settings of the image processing .
the default time@@ out is that all green pixels are equal to ultra@@ violet light . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimum loss of details . this option sets the image a bit soft , elim@@ in@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white off of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , automatic colour balance is used .
this setting is only used when the white paper is not set . default it is a fixed color balance that was photographed on a white card which was photographed in the sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SLR cameras . the use of the second sensors has the effect that they are exposed in four steps more details in top lights . for other cameras this option is igno@@ red .
the standard is the peak light , so the parts of your camera that are plug@@ ged in due to the in@@ ability of your camera the top white in the settings . use the setting colors generated some unusual results , as it shows the cutting in various ro@@ ses . last you can try to re@@ constru@@ ct some parts of the missing information from top lights .
this is possible because blue pixels in general is not so quickly saturation like green and red . &amp; d@@ cra@@ w try to re@@ constru@@ ct the missing green and red shar@@ ehol@@ dings from the still not saturated blue pixels . of course this is a question , how much color or white you want .
if you select the option you select the option to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adjusted individually for each picture .
set the lumin@@ ance value after your taste . you must probably set him somewhat higher than the default 1 . this may also be made later in the picture options of &amp; digi@@ came ; - image processing is also recommended to keep the time for Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should commit con@@ serv@@ atively .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from colour @-@ filtered image sensor , which have many cameras and have a matrix @-@ coloured pixel . this algorithm is also known as CFA @-@ inter@@ pol@@ ation or color structure .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; and D@@ cra@@ w are available to you three alternatives : Bil@@ in@@ ear , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests , it was produced as if A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number from gradient ) was created . however , it creates color line acts on edges . Bil@@ in@@ ear is interesting if you &apos;re looking for a quick solution using an acceptable result .
if you know the colour of your l@@ ent@@ ils you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a color correction , as you will be carried out during the shell conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the colour information and gives instructions as these should be given . there are also LC@@ MS and &amp; digi@@ arrived ; information like the color information from an color space to transl@@ ate into the others the colors are as accurately as possible .
behavior Questions if a picture is opened in image processing / color management module with raw files .
color profile folder S@@ occupy here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC / or / home / .@@ Color / ICC , where you can save all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ came ; investigated this folder then during the start .
settings of the ICC @-@ Profile you have here the option &amp; quot ; default sources ; for your profile to deposit . everything can change when opening the raw file later .
the color @-@ statement view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Arg@@ l . here , only your pictures are not administered to the entire screen .
the input profiles should be used to fit the camera manufacturers and model that do not use . there are some , such as Canon which does not contain color mapping or gam@@ ma@@ correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w Gamma is not included for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to perform the color mapping itself .
there are further options like the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of @-@ profile , with which you can print , as your printer may print a smaller color range than your camera and some colors are therefore very saturated . this could manually adjust instead of itself on the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras it is pretty obvious that colour profile with them wo@@ ke for them . unfortunately , there is not a table of cameras and profiles can fit together here . this response is naturally un@@ official :
the Canon Profile Extension allows the style to detect the style : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plug@@ in interface . it is an interface supported by a series of &amp; k@@ de ; images and image processing is supported ; many modules support , which have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the modules that you want to use , and these modules will be loaded from &amp; digi@@ . these modules appear as new entries in the main window of the main window and in addition you will also find some examples in the context menu of the pre@@ ferences .
memor@@ andum for tasks that are carried out by modules can be set up in the menu under settings .
for more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I @-@ modules you can get via the K@@ IP@@ I project via ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ k@@ ip@@ i @-@ plug@@ in .org or in the hand@@ books of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the slide should be easy to understand . the upper kno@@ b adjust@@ s the time between the image inputs , usually are 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . the other check boxes switch the met@@ ad@@ ata , or that ends at the bottom end of the pictures during the ad .
the camera features show on the left side a list of all the camera supported cameras . if you want to use it , make sure that the camera is correctly connected , enabled and in image display mode . below are the port settings . currently , serial , USB@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage space are supported .
at the bottom end you can set the path for USB@@ - and Fire@@ wire ( IEEE @-@ 1394 or i @-@ Link ) . this field is only active if you have a USB@@ - or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera &apos;s camera . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / space when you enter your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; you need to connect the camera to your computer to set it in the display mode .
try out whether &amp; digi@@ came ; the camera automatically det@@ ects and set the camera . if you have set up your camera , your camera will be displayed in the camera menu .
you can select any name for your camera . it is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you own more than a camera , you can insert them here .
with the option dialog for re@@ loc@@ ating &gt; images in the tr@@ ash@@ can you can adjust the conversation of &amp; digi@@ plug ; when del@@ eting a photos into an album . in the cle@@ aring of a photos and del@@ etion of a album you will find further details .
the editorial changes due to the right side bar can be shut down by &amp; digi@@ plug ; if you use the option to use in the right side@@ bar no back questions . otherwise , you need to use the changes to the button changes .
you can also download the display of the welcome screen of &amp; digi@@ plug ; when starting , this will accelerate the start step by &amp; digi@@ plug ;
the setup of the start after new photos may search &amp; digi@@ came ; the base file after new or dissolved albums / photos . if something from the base folder was deleted , ask &amp; digi@@ came ; you ask whether it is to delete these from the database .
different colour schem@@ as can be used in &amp; digi@@ plug ; used to adjust the main window to your taste . this settings can select under settings design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of available designs will be listed below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in a new design for &amp; digi@@ plug ; please find further information about this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use this to view your photos and to correction and improvement . the image processing can be accessed by a click with the left mouse button on the preview of a picture or by the context menu of preview and selection of the details pane / editing .
the picture processing contains a range of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ plug ; therefore , they are not part of your distribution . further information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules can be found in the section image processing .
a status line at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current record number , magni@@ fication factor and the current image size .
a menu bar at the top edge and including the tool bar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
the machining functions of the image processing change your photos . however , no features will change the original photo before you can &apos;t use the Save or button Save from the tool@@ bar . note that you can not recover the original photo once you have saved the picture .
so you should make a copy of your image before you change it . you can save it with file Save as well .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can re @-@ restore the original image by re @-@ establish the button Rest@@ oration of Recover in the tool@@ bar . you lose any change that you have done on the photo since the last store .
almost any action of the image processing can be re@@ formed or re @-@ produced or re@@ produced . the last action can be re@@ formed , by choosing working or re@@ produced by choosing machining from the menu .
if you often use this , you should make the key short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ z for re@@ viewing and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; you can select a button menu on the back or re @-@ produce button in the tool@@ bar . if you select one of the menu entries , all the actions are made between also revers@@ ed or recovered .
once you have started the image processing , you can move between photos in the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , picture height , image files or entries in the menu file . if you have made changes in the current photo you will be asked if you want to save it .
you can enter in the photo and zoom in which you can use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse or symbols in the tool@@ bar or entries in the tool@@ bar menu .
to adapt a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : select the magni@@ fication factor automatically
view Full Screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode . when you don &apos;t want to use the Es@@ c button . normally you can &apos;t change this in the setup dialog for &amp; digi@@ plug ; you can call this out of the &amp; digi@@ plug ; see section for setting up the image processing .
if you want to print the current picture , you can select the image file in the menu and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can custom@@ ize the settings before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print individual pictures or full sentences . you need to select the images with the standard methods and select from the menu album Export Print . if you want to follow the assistant , you will only need to make your choice .
the main window is available ; main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge , which is important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available without the navigation use , even in the image processing . it will be displayed if one of the five riders is cli@@ cked :
multiple Click on the same rider does the side@@ bar appear or disappear again in the edge .
in the super@@ v@@ ents view you can enter or insert it . note the text below . the text is UTF @-@ 8 compatible . that means that all special characters are allowed . the labelling will be copied to EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - fields so that you can use other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are truncated to 2000 characters . if you want to use the IP@@ TC label in other applications , you should consider these restrictions .
after you comment it , use either the button of user or change to the next image , which will be stored then .
besides the user button you can read a button More . with this , you can read further met@@ ad@@ ata from the selected file or database . however , you can always select the met@@ ad@@ ata to the files . however , this will always be performed if you have a met@@ ad@@ ata setting .
the section assessment shows an evaluation scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sor@@ ters . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . in order to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select this from and use the context menu .
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field identi@@ fier . the coding follows the scheme in the following table :
the key@@ word view shows a search box for fil@@ tering the key@@ word , the key@@ word tree and a selection box with the previously used in this &amp; digi@@ plug ; -@@ session .
the key@@ word tree will be dynam@@ ically adapted to the given search word . you can quickly restri@@ ct the number of possibilities when searching for a key@@ word . this ability is especially useful if you have many key@@ words .
the input field at the bottom end is a further relief during the input of sample words in a picture series . if you have entered different words , these are saved for quick access .
tags can also be set by marking the corresponding check@@ boxes in the tree . all tags of a picture are stored in the IP@@ TC field Key@@ word .
if several pictures are selected in the main screen and select a key@@ word in the key@@ word tree , this is only applied to the highlighted picture and not to the entire selection , if you want a selection with a key@@ word , please read the section Key@@ word filter .
the side@@ bar key@@ word filter is used to change the selection of displayed in the main window . usually , the left side@@ bar is used with their album , - fil@@ ming , key@@ word and view@@ points . if additionally one or several key@@ word filter from the right @-@ hand side will be used , only the volume of these two are displayed . all created keywords are available .
you can also draw tags and put them off . if the key@@ word already exists , you can simply drag them to the right side bar and put them on the selection . then a dialog box that asks you asks if you want to put the key@@ word .
in the above example , the main window shows the images on a calendar day . the key@@ word filter is reduced to no matter what the amount is reduced to three pictures . you were taken to C@@ tr@@ l + a and then a key@@ word from the right @-@ word tree was taken into the selection and put there . a dialog asks if this key@@ word should be set .
this search for changes takes place in any start of the program . you can also be disabled under the settings .
if you have a rule with and created and notice that it should be a or should be , you can easily change this easily with a double click on the text and the rules .
( 1 ) : entry to be found in the database . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , image , key@@ word , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or a string , is already set in the database .
for example , you can define a Extended search over all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group@@ ing options , you need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then to use the button group . the options are shown as follows :

this article / Tut@@ orial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I shared it mainly at &amp; digi@@ came ; s concrete implementation .
the reason why one uses a color@@ ized workflow or sc@@ anned colors are the colors used by your camera or sc@@ anners . with a color @-@ administered workflow you can reach the colors on your monitor from your camera or sc@@ anners , or the colors they publish or in the web , which correspond to your digital dark chamber .
if the topic is on color administration , then everyone wants to press what buttons must be provided for the results that he would like to provide you . unfortunately , the sense of this tutorial is available to give you sufficient background information about color management . in addition , you should make links with deeper information enable you to obtain the desired results .
if your screen work@@ flows shall be met all six below criteria , then you must not take care of the colour scheme .
you can work on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated on the RGB @-@ color space . ( more information please see below )
your only other photo expend@@ itures are via e @-@ mail or the web , where the RGB is the de @-@ fac@@ to standard .
so if the RGB works so well and the life for all so easy , why should one use another color space and make sure thought about color holes ?
a visual example of limitation of RGB compared to the colors we really can see below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hu@@ fe@@ isen@@ shaped region , and the colors in the RGB color space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB using a few larger colours , please visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms page and click on info and then on information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I need to monitor my monitor if I decided to work in the RGB color space ?
yes ! whether you work in the RGB color space or not , you need to connect your monitor to your monitor . if you work as a RGB space of s@@ RGB , you need to use either your monitor on the RGB standard alli@@ g@@ ator , use a matching monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions to improve the image in most cases . use it therefore before you are attemp@@ ting to open a further manual .
the functions norm@@ alize , the same , Autom@@ atically and contrast expand from the menu to correct automatic correction , try automatically from your colors the best . you will have to experiment with these effects , to see what works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled the entire picture , so that the dar@@ k@@ est point is black and the brigh@@ test item as bright as possible without changing its color shades . this function is often a Mag@@ ical correction for images that are dark or balanced .
the same method : this method is adjusted the illumin@@ ator of the colors of the selected image so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity of a picture , sometimes it produces only tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation that causes either wonders in a picture or it destroyed it .
automatic : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue duct . it calcul@@ ates the dark and bright tone tones , and adjust@@ s the red , green and blue channels on the complete hist@@ ogram area .
contrast enlarge : this method improves contrast and lumin@@ osity of the RGB values of a picture through the post@@ p@@ one of the lowest and highest values of all values between . this is only visible in balanced images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white off of &amp; digi@@ plug ; is a semi @-@ automated tool to perform the white off of a photo .
the white @-@ off correction is somewhat limited since via an color space with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you can do so far from the original image , if you can perform white off in the raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your ways will fall better to correction .
this tool is based on a white or@@ derly algorithm of the copyright by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . they start the menu entry colours white off the image processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left hand we can see both the original image and preview of the target image . the preview can be adapted to the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original wh@@ it@@ ish again , then it is enough to enlarge the window .
the preview of the target photos has a red mark@@ er . the lumin@@ ance of the Pix@@ els under this mark@@ er is displayed as vertical line in hist@@ ogram .
to the right is a hist@@ ogram , as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in good illuminated images , most pixels are displayed very small L@@ umin@@ ants . with a button you can choose whether one of the three colors or your sum will be displayed . the sum will be L@@ umin@@ anz .
the contrast of your result depends on sh@@ adows , saturation and Gamma . the sh@@ adows is adjustable to improve the shadow details of your photos or down di@@ mm@@ ing .
an@@ stat with the above controls mentioned above , you should use the colour temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the images to calculate the color temperature of the white image . on this species also the temperature and green values are set automatically .
in addition , you can set the white off with the list of default settings . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors if more than a color channel of the Pix@@ els is exposed . you will get the combined result in white off . this will appear in a preview of a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons Save as and load make exactly this . any adjustment of the white image you can set it into a text file and later re@@ load .
the kno@@ b settings puts all the filter values again on its standard values and associated neutral white effects . note that also neutral settings can be found as your original . if you store this , your original image will be changed .
you can set the encoding per color channel of the mach@@ ined image . 8 @-@ bit encoding is better suited for high quality images . however , this coding is also needed for high quality images . however , this coding is also needed for the formats of PNG , P@@ N@@ M , TIFF , and D@@ NG formats .
this tool opens the same dialogue like the processing of raw images . it uses the modification and assignment of color profiles . a detailed instructions for use of color pro@@ filing can be set to the chapter of paint administration .
another important tool is available in the menu below colors . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously . this is helpful if your camera or your scanner may always make the same errors , and therefore you always need the same correction . in the manual for the MP3 correction , you will find further information .
a very powerful option of exposure problems to correct is the tool for gra@@ dation , that you can find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Tool@@ kit displays four colour effects , a solar effect effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a Neon Effect and an edge filter available .
in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , a effect from the additional light . this had the effect that the brigh@@ ter areas of dar@@ ker and the colours have been inver@@ ted by the second lighting . the result was a partial negative image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine .
the intensity controls the solar system . at approx . 50 % intensity , the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . another increase creates a negative image that is not to generate on phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier .
this is an example of the solar panel . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the process ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the vi@@ vid filter sim@@ ulates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it distingu@@ ishes itself from a saturation that makes it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and gl@@ itter@@ ing . try it easy to emb@@ ell@@ ate many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for a stunning colour film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film ; the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ vi@@ as are very saturated color in daylight and high contra@@ sts . these characteristics are also some photograph@@ ers , especially those which are hardly any landscapes .
the Ne@@ on@@ filter sim@@ ulates ne@@ on@@ light on the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repet@@ itions the strength of the Ne@@ on@@ light . at large images the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it &apos;s not unusual that you want to correct the color Con@@ tr@@ ast and the lumin@@ osity of photos . as soon as you can be satisfied with the result . once you are satisfied with the result , use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you make a photo of poor lighting conditions , you can get a good choice to increase saturation instead of saturation . all changes you can perform in preview . if the result you like the result , you can confirm your changes with O@@ k .
between the complex set of gra@@ dation and the simple Leu@@ k strength / contrast / Gamma is the tool tape correction for improving the exposure . even if the dialogue has been very complicated , you need only the range of shooting . specifically the three shooting below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph@@ s are three sl@@ ugs to change the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to get to the operation is the kno@@ b to post@@ p@@ one and make sure the picture changes .
on the right hand , the original and preview of the image can be viewed . the preview will be dynam@@ ically modified , based on the settings of the image , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : this selection box can be set if the hist@@ ogram with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y @-@ axis is frequently used in pictures of a constant colour . in pictures the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single column . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic influence is useful .
three kno@@ bs : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for medium sounds , often called Gam@@ ma@@ ize .
the three color buttons can be used in the preview of the original image , to automatically adjust the input values of the shadow , medium and bright tones automatically . furthermore , there is a button for fully automatic alignment .
output values : the output values allow a selection of manual values for each field . there are also two controllers also used to change the output values like in the input values . the compression of the output values may be used to create a light picture as background , while something else is fore@@ ground to see .
automatically : with this button , the image values are set automatically depending on the intensity values of the image .
save and loading : with these buttons , the set values can be stored in the file system and re @-@ loaded later . the Gim@@ p level format is used .
if you are using this mode and the three colour pi@@ p@@ ettes , the input values will automatically be adjusted automatically for all shade , funds and sun shades . enable the colour pi@@ p@@ ette which you want to use and click on the preview of the Hist@@ o@@ Program for red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance channels .
the option over@@ exposed pixels controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it is not an effect on the final outcome .
below , take an example of the alignment of input values to the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the correct picture with ( 2 ) .
on the left hand , half of the origin@@ als and the target image will be shown . the preview will be updated automatically depending on your settings . on the right hand the following options are available :
modification channel : this selection box allows to use the channel that is modified by the module :
in addition to this cheese there are two symbols to change between one linear and a log@@ arith@@ mic view . for images with a digital camera , linear mode produces a wide beam . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic mode helps in this case .
for example , if you move a circuit board to the right , e.g. the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones correspond with dar@@ ker output files and the corresponding image pixel are dar@@ ker .
in the preview of the original photos is a red flag . if you want to change this marking on the area you want to change the original score . create a point on this line and move it on and off until the value is adjusted according to your taste .
save and loading : with these buttons you can make exactly this . each curve may be saved in the file system and later to be loaded . the file format is the Gim@@ p curve format .
when using this method and the three colour pi@@ p@@ ettes automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of the shadow , medium and sun tones . enable the colour pi@@ p@@ ette which you want to use and click on the original image to put the control points for the rotor , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the over@@ exposed pixel option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixel . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixel , you will get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it is not an effect on the final outcome .
below you can see a black @-@ white photo that has been corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun tones was applied with the colour pi@@ p@@ ette and adjusted to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and this corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer of the &amp; digi@@ came ; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels , or change the color shades of the photos .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix color shades of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer for image processing .
with the channel selection box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram . this gives you a first note how you can adjust the relative distribution and r@@ ash . the left section of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed as opposed to their own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red mark@@ er . if you positioned this in the picture , a vertical line in hist@@ ogram is displayed by giving you the corresponding color value .
the controls for the module are right below : kno@@ b for red , green and construction allow you to keep these channels too . if you also activate the color mixer , since the channel mixer then is the tool to generate great black @-@ and conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black @-@ and @-@ white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ och@@ rome , the reduction of a colour is to be found in the same place in the colour channel and whose prem@@ ise looks different in each channel . if this is the case you can improve your mon@@ och@@ rome conversion by reducing the far@@ brau@@ schen in which you first reduce the far@@ brau@@ schen .
the Save as and store buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any mixer mode allows you to save and then load . that used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the option over@@ exposed pixels controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it is not an effect on the final outcome .
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel was newly adjusted . the original image is activated ( 1 ) and the illustrated picture below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a step forward because color pictures can be easily converted to the computer . also with a set of film rolls profiles .

with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; mould texture can apply decorative tex@@ tures on an image to apply .
by adding a texture to your image , whether it is a colour screen or not , you can look like a oil painting on a canvas , the pins of an old master , a Pop Art portrait of enlarged points or like a wall picture on a wall . the menu entry picture texture can be used for this .
relief : post@@ p@@ one of this parameter to the right increases the depth of the depth and three @-@ dimensional texture of the texture .
a paper text effect is applied on the photo below . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) . the relief is set to 200 .
add &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool frame Adding a decorative frame to be added to a picture .
the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photos is no easy task . a possibility to maintain its attention to create a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for scatter@@ ing eye . under picture frame , the module can be made from the image processing .
type : with this parameter set the desired frame type for your picture . consistent with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ and @-@ white pictures ) , stirring it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame of the ideal is ideal for a button setting and decor@@ atively adds a decorative frame with patterns .
width : specifies the width of the frame in percent . the value range for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
this is larger than the original , but the same aspect ratio is larger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing images , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio .
with this practical tool , you can easily insert a format in any picture at any point . this also goes on several digits when you need it .
this tool is very intu@@ iti@@ vely used . simply use text direction , orientation , color from the colour space and the character set with its characteristics as you need them . you &apos;ll simply select the character set size . to the end you &apos;ll simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background . already , the picture is finished .
each setting you have chosen for your text can be changed to the button &quot; OK &quot; after the picture has been stored once , the text is part of the picture . it can &apos;t be changed anymore .
to get the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Tool Templates can create a sten@@ cil over a picture .
the menu image Templates which can be used in the image processing can be used to create templates over a picture .
for sten@@ cil there is no restrictions regarding the size and orientation . you need to add your template format and should then add to the compression size of template . if you want to add your templates and digi@@ plug ; you simply send an e @-@ mail in English to the &amp; digi@@ arrived ; mail@@ ing@@ list digi@@ arrived @-@ Users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use this tool for the first time you need to set your template folder with the button base folder in the dialog . select the folder where you copied the template files . these settings are indicated for next start .
after the root folder for sten@@ cils , a building back is displayed , which reflects the size structure of the sten@@ cil template . the selection of a folder will be updated automatically .
there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this kno@@ b enlarges the following image . it will be cent@@ ered around the position of your mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shr@@ ink : this kno@@ b resi@@ zed the lower picture . if you want to use the mouse button . if you want to use the template on the whole picture you need to size the picture accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
post@@ p@@ one : use this button to post@@ p@@ one the picture below the template . take the picture and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to use template on your picture . the image will then be adjusted automatically the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ came ; provides three different tools for shar@@ pen@@ ing . each of them has pre@@ ferences in other areas .
shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . it &apos;s very fast and easy , but , especially in dark areas , gra@@ ins pictures .
un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ess mask works on the contrast of edges to look like a picture @-@ sharp@@ ly . it can use it to remove atmospheric Dun@@ st and it makes it a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by copyright by Win@@ ston Chang .
re@@ focus is the best of the three because it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its use and has different parameters for adap@@ ting .
photos without focus as well as most digit@@ ised images require a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this again shows that sharp edges need to be printed on paper . this is that sharp edges need to be printed on paper . SLR cameras require usually more subsequently sharp@@ ness as normal cameras for private users .
at JPEG pictures , a camera was often used in shar@@ pen@@ ing . images in the raw format must always be processed in the processing format .
some sc@@ anners apply a shar@@ pen@@ ess filter already during the reading of the image . if you dis@@ able it , you will get the control of your image .
in some situations you can get usable results by shar@@ pen@@ ing a photo of shar@@ pen@@ ing shar@@ pen@@ ing . you can correct shar@@ pen@@ ing in the menu .
they should be careful , as the results are not extremely natural : the sharp@@ ness increase sharp@@ ness of edges , but also ampli@@ fies the noise . in general , it is a usable technique to shar@@ pen@@ ing the tool . in general , you can find further information and compare all techniques for shar@@ pen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : one image is too cris@@ py , it is much easier to draw . use the tool to correct switch and experim@@ enting with the menu entry . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter sp@@ ur@@ red is a very good tool to remove sli@@ ders from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview Help the image . the preview window shows the issue of the filter with the current Settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values produce good results and should be tried first . a increase in radius or viewing ampli@@ fy the effect . if you produce the un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed mask , smoke and the impression of gr@@ ates in the vicinity produce sharp edges .
the radius will be like many pixels on each side of a edge through the filters . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . you should therefore sharp@@ ens pictures at the best in its final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wi@@ ped image one which is added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the sw@@ elling value is a break out of the maximum RGB value and the difference difference . one can define the minimum difference to an edge of the filter . in this way , areas may be used with a soft change between the tones of shar@@ pen@@ ing and therefore f@@ eit errors in faces , directions and water surface .
this is an example of the un@@ bl@@ ur@@ red filters . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the revised picture ( 2 ) . un@@ bl@@ ur@@ red was used with a radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a swing value = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ came ; Tool reag@@ ent focus on an image through improvement of the edge . it used the ur@@ gent in@@ activation filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to shar@@ pen a picture . this is better approach as merely to try to shar@@ pen drawing . this is better to use a technique called F@@ IR Vien@@ nese fil@@ tering . usually better results can start better results as un@@ bl@@ ur@@ red . you can start it from the menu by calling colour reproduction in the image processing .
in practice , the circular fli@@ cker is much better than the G@@ auss &apos;s folding . the Gau@@ ge has a very long tail , which are far away from the sw@@ elling pixel . the F@@ IR Wiener In@@ verse of the G@@ auss &apos;s F@@ split is even influenced in most cases , which causes adverse out@@ comes .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the most important parameter for the use of this module . for most pictures should result the default value 1 good results . you can set a higher value if your image is very un@@ bl@@ ur@@ red but then on the Heiligen@@ sch@@ one .
correlation : a correlation of correlation can help to reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0.5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation is reduced to the sharp@@ ness of the module .
Rau@@ sch@@ filter : an increase in the space filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values are higher than 0.1 only rarely found . if the smoke filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very poor . a usable value is 0,@@ 03 . a good value is still further contamination .
G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness . use this parameter to avoid un@@ shar@@ pen@@ sive filter . in most cases , you should use this value to 0 to avoid anno@@ ying arti@@ facts . if you must use a value un@@ equal zero , then you may also increase the correlation and / or the sound filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of transformation matrix . an increase of the matrix size can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circular edge or the G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness . note that the module is very slow if you choose to choose large values for this parameter . in most cases , you should select a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the stores and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any reproduction parameters will be set to you later and then it can be loaded .
try all trimm@@ ing , color and intensity correction on the picture before you use the module .
otherwise you should use the module before you change the image . the reason for this is that many operations changes are not visible immediately , but leave later un@@ pleasant arti@@ facts .
if you want to read images and compressed , &amp; eg ; when JPEG , you should use the module to un@@ compressed image .
generally , the sharp m@@ ask@@ bar produces better results as shar@@ pen@@ ing . this could be caused by the in@@ sharp m@@ ask@@ bar a bigger neighbourhood than shar@@ pen@@ ing .
theore@@ tically it must always be un@@ bl@@ ur@@ red . even under optimal conditions it is never possible to remove the effect of the un@@ shar@@ k . however , the result of the F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ ters is always good as good as the un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed mask . the F@@ IR Wiener filter is often better when machining small details .
below , you can see a comparison between different filters , applied on a small un@@ focused picture :
the original un@@ sharp colour screen has to be corrected . this picture has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is attributable to in@@ sufficient light for the auto @-@ focus lens .
for more information about methods to shar@@ pen@@ ing methods in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the kno@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kno@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kno@@ cked the shar@@ pen@@ ess of the dar@@ ken@@ ing area to create a better P@@ up@@ ille . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the colour tin@@ ts allows an adapted color for the pup@@ il . if you want to set blue eyes instead of dark , then you can set it here .
the error correction is one of the most widely developed tool in order to remove the desired art@@ e@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE Team of GR@@ EC CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
this tool contains several default settings as Star@@ points to simpli@@ fy the restoration work . the default settings are listed below :
in case you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use the riders and advanced settings .
typically , p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of the details . if larger values leads to a smooth glass of smooth regions and details sharp . a value of 0.9 should receive mainly homogen@@ eous regions , and details sharp . please note that the details of shar@@ pen@@ ess should always be sub@@ divided .
the direction @-@ depen@@ dency Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smoo@@ ther evenly into all directions , while a value close to 1 is only allowed in one direction . if you have a film @-@ scale or CCD noise , a high value can be created . JPEG Ar@@ te@@ facts will be eliminated at a value close to 1 .
smoo@@ thing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this puts the maximum smoo@@ thing factor above all . p then defines the relative smoo@@ thing . adjust this value to the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is needed . this is difficult if it is difficult to generate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos; tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be higher than 3 .
repet@@ itions : are on how often the algorithm is running through . usually 1 or 2 goes out .
angle length da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic Alpha . if Alpha is selected , there should also be small . make sure that small angle should be a long run time . you should select this value as greatest possible and acceptable for your needs .
integ@@ rative stri@@ de length &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral stri@@ de length in pixels . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoo@@ thing and never exceed 2 .
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the more to quality you receive by selecting this option is only low . it doubles the running time . we recommend it to leave it .
buttons Save as and load make exactly this . any setting of image error correction can be saved in a text file and later re@@ loaded .
image error correction is compar@@ atively very fast when working . it can still take very long and take a high CPU load after yourself . you can therefore break the calculation anytime with the button .
below you can see how picture error fixing is corrected . the module is shown in a photo that was made in Guatemala City with a analog camera . as you can see there is a strange black art@@ e@@ facts in the fore@@ ground that caused by a bad movie storage during the journey . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the correct picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ came ; noise reduction is a powerful tool to reduce noise levels . it uses a protected protected algorithm of Peter tail@@ ert .
this tool provides selectable image filters to remove st@@ ains and other arti@@ facts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens , too . it can be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or fashion ; effects of saved pictures from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read this in English in this tutorial .
the screen photo above shows a typical scene which has been made with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ y@@ less noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , only the bottom windows and the lower @-@ window settings can stay with the default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 41@@ x@@ 41 ) which is used for the filter . large values increase the time that the filter per pixel can be used and the picture can spread over the image and the colour in it is smoo@@ ther and therefore smaller errors .
sharp@@ ness : controls the shar@@ pen@@ ile seal . this value does not adjust the pixel pitch to establish lumin@@ ance changes . if it is increased , you need to change the edges . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image data can not get more and noise or lubric@@ ating again .
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . if it is too strong , the frequency response of the filter . if it is too heavily , the whole noise can occur or Rau@@ sch@@ ism . put it on a value close to the maximum , if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG arti@@ facts without any details .
light density : controls the lumin@@ ance of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ ther process by the details -@@ settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ ther process by the details -@@ settings .
gamma : controls the gam@@ em@@ ol@@ er@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase tolerance values of dar@@ ker areas , which typically are stronger , however , he cont@@ am@@ inated the shadow ranges .
damp@@ ing : controls the adjustment of the Ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ ing damp@@ ing . this value defines how fast the adap@@ tive filter radius will appear . if it is increased , the edges appear , if it is too high , the noise and Ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter appear on the edges . it can remove rob@@ ot@@ ting and is the recommended method for it .
save and store : these buttons are used exactly for this . all parameters for the spac@@ er which you have set , can be saved in the file system and later loaded .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected using ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is cris@@ p for your purpose . the solution to shar@@ pen the image is much easier than a picture . use tool to correct switch and experim@@ enting with the menu entry . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ came ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most widely developed tools to reduce photo acts .
this filter for restoration gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of un@@ wanted arti@@ facts , film grain , scrat@@ ches , compression acts and local errors that create in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ ised images to remove . the smoo@@ thing occurs along the image con@@ tours and thus gets the contents like it also makes the human eye .
the same algorithm can be used for color and tex@@ tured encryption . the algorithm is developed with another tool , the image error correction . the algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE Team of the GR@@ EC CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ í and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
JPEG Ar@@ te@@ facts reduce : compression of JPEG is not perfect in some areas , it creates some compression &amp; quot ; Ar@@ te@@ facts &amp; quot ; - small standards that are displayed in un@@ compressed image . this setting is to correct these problems .
the buttons Save as and load make exactly this . each setting of photo restoration can hereby be saved in a text file and later re@@ loaded .
photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can still take very long and take a high CPU load after yourself . you can therefore break the calculation anytime with the button .
below you can reduce like a photo with equal noise .. The module is applied to a black and white photo that has been absorbed by a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( TM ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the inf@@ am@@ ous film specimens on the faces . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected visual under ( 2 ) .
below , you can see another example of photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures was applied to an old color photograph , which has been read with a scanner . you can see the scan species from the sc@@ ann@@ er@@ ical and the phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the correct picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows for hot@@ pixel of photos that were with a CCD camera , eight were too removed . it uses the algorith@@ ms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pix@@ i project that are protected by copyright by Martin Dick@@ ens .
bright , t@@ ote or hot pixels are a problem with high quality raw quality photos , as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixel quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright pixel quot ; there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wi@@ z@@ ard with the button dark image . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important to discover the dark image directly in the connection to discover new hot or bright pixel by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should download the appropriate dark image to the correct image . please note that the assistant will re@@ mark the last dark image and re@@ load this automatically at the next session .
the image area and the preview can help you correct within the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are highlighted in all aspects .
select an area to view the def@@ ective pixels on preview and the results of the filter . then choose the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the following filters :
thirst : an average of the neighboring pixel is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all def@@ ective pixels in a block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from pixel can be moved to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the damaged pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a gap of 2 or less to the pixel block are moved to comp@@ ute an bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
Kub@@ isch : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less then moved to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the damaged pixels in the block .
below , you can see the hot@@ pixel correction on a color photograph , from a damaged digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure to be applied . the original image has been increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the correct picture is below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the Vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. down@@ exposed corners , a picture to correct .
wide angle lens , particularly those in the medium and large photo format , can not evenly illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range instead . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ting quot ; ( shaded ) to reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light to the sensor there .
but he also has dis@@ advantages . many center filter require a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the bl@@ ending filter , which should be impossible to keep the camera with hand . wide angle lens should also use , also with center filter , an aperture of f / 16 or smaller , otherwise un@@ shar@@ k effects arise .
with the large exposure ranges of today &apos;s fil@@ ming and colour gra@@ dation of digital cameras and film scanner , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a Cent@@ er@@ filter , which is used without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is based on an image filter . the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker .
using three controllers , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction @-@ Filter and with three further exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light output at the point of the highest density , the default density is 2.0 , which allows an optical filter with a aperture setting of 1 , or random@@ ly to compens@@ ate the density to compens@@ ate a greater degree of Vig@@ net@@ ting to compens@@ ate it to compens@@ ate a small degree .
Leu@@ ch@@ starch , contrast and Gamma -@@ Settings : the processing of a picture with the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is reduced by the lumin@@ ance of pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the kno@@ b must provide you only positive values because you only need to increase the settings .
if you want a more sensitive re @-@ adjustment of the target image , so you can use the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / Gamma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing from the menu color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the Vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected picture . a Leu@@ ch@@ oline and contrast correction was also carried out in the picture with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ came ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a protected domestic algorithm by David Hod@@ son .
this tool operates with geomet@@ ric distortion . color@@ less distortion can not be corrected using this tool .
the coefficient of the second gra@@ des treated the general geomet@@ ric distortion of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or con@@ ve@@ x shape of the image .
the coefficient of the third gra@@ b has a similar effect effect , fl@@ eight on edges . this correction is not applied to the tool .
the coefficient of coefficient correc@@ ts the remote corners opposite the second degree . if you combine these two , every geomet@@ ric distortion is almost eliminated .
generally : this value controls the strength of distortion second gra@@ des . with negative values , tons of distortion can be corrected and positive values of c@@ is@@ sen@@ ic distortion .
corner : this value controls the strength of distortion fourth Gra@@ des . this value gets stronger than in the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most l@@ ent@@ ils the &apos; corners parameter set the parameter to the parameter General .
zoom : this value sc@@ aled the image size and results in a correction first Gra@@ des through . negative values increase during positive image .
bright : this value adjusted the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase it .
to help you get the best filter settings , illustrated the dialog with a preview of distortion . the values you are using for your image , are stored and used at the next start as standard values .
the tons or k@@ is@@ sen@@ ic correction should be carried out before all trimm@@ ing or size changes . best , you perform this correction as all the first . if you want to cut a picture and then a tons @-@ shaped correction would be the effect of apparent the fal@@ cons .
to help you find the best correction you can display this tool a vertical and a horizontal relief line . move it to an important place , such as the sea side or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this spot . in the connection , you can correct the tons / k@@ is@@ sen@@ ic distortion with the help of the lines .
if you have a k@@ is@@ sen@@ ic distortion is the resulting image black corners . you can cut them with the cutting tool in the menu transformer cutting from the image processing or using the zoom kno@@ b this dialog .
for most pictures the tonn@@ age is sufficient . the next logical step for some designs , such as recordings from the front , frame and paintings , it is the perspective to correct the all angles in the picture 90 degrees . note that if you keep the camera with hand , you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective .
this is an example of the tons @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the correct picture below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method for sim@@ ulating infrared film the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website , which can be accessed below this URL . filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( TM ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infrared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window you can choose the area for preview . if you move the red rectangle with your mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview you can set two parameters to sim@@ ulate film grain and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . the ISO kno@@ b changes the amount of film pieces and the domin@@ ance of colour green ( chlor@@ ophyll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white like snow !
since the filter can@@ als for re@@ produce infrared film , especially the green canal makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos , as the color information are missing .
this is an example of infr@@ a @-@ red cinem@@ as applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the illustrated picture below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film has been set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values produce a type of au@@ ra in peak lights .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter tra@@ ys is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to re@@ produce film pieces like the B / W Ko@@ dak Tr@@ i @-@ X , for example the sensitivity of the movies to increase the manufacturers large silver gra@@ ins of the phot@@ emul@@ sion .
the film @-@ effect booster gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the previously treated picture gets rid of a tim@@ eless atmosphere of daily life . if you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , road photo , gra@@ ined view , especially in your mon@@ och@@ rome photos , you need to use this filter .
with the controller , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the gra@@ ins . the default value is , although higher values are needed , if you need more baskets , you can use the filter several times .
this is an example of film gra@@ dation for a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and this worked the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter oil paintings creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter oil paintings gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting . natural pictures and style are good for this effect .
there exist two controllers in order to influence this effect . the upper cho@@ oses the brush size between one and five . thick brush are better suited for large images . smooth or , from the other side , consider the right .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the processing is marked with ( 2 ) . pin size for this 640 pixel image is 1 and Gl@@ ory 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter coal drawing used color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a spro@@ ut in the drawing , are emphas@@ ized . images whose gradient can be slowly change if you would like to imagine what scene you would have chosen to sk@@ ate you . this would be good pictures to start .
there are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper kno@@ b cho@@ oses the pin size and the lower adjusted the contrast ( Gl@@ ory ) .
this is an example of the charcoal drawing filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be improved further by adjusting the intensity level .
the &amp; digi@@ came ; filter engraving your image in 3 @-@ D , as if it was stamped in wax . it uses a protected domestic algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter engraving is a fast tool to return your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works very well with pictures with a simple structure , where colour is not the most important part of the content . the filter uses the difference between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey , mon@@ och@@ able landscape .
the depth allows to set the contrast of the fil@@ tering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the mach@@ ined picture ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork with distortion effect . it uses copyright protected algorith@@ ms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divi@@ des the image into cells , and will look like whether it is viewed by glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : analogue to wave blocks 1 shows the picture here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects need a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel this effects at any time with the button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork with an adverse effects . it uses copyright protected algorith@@ ms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Un@@ shar@@ fe : wi@@ pe the picture along a circular lines coming from a central point . this sim@@ ulates the un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed camera and creates a dynamic expression of often in sports photography .
radical in@@ sharp@@ ness : twi@@ sted the image by rotation of pixels around a central point . this sim@@ ulates the un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed camera of a turning camera .
rem@@ over @-@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ pe the picture around the effect of a non @-@ focused camera content . the object seems to come back in the background .
movement of movement : ver@@ aging the image by horizontal movements of pixels . this sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photographer , camera .
soft p@@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ pe the image soft in the dark and strongly in bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ aming and shiny sharp focus effect ( Hamilton Effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ amour photos or to add a warm and sub@@ til@@ ing bulb .
Schüt@@ g@@ un@@ shar@@ fe : wi@@ pe the image through random displacement of pixels and sim@@ ulates the im@@ aging of a arbitr@@ ary moving camera .
intelligent un@@ shar@@ fe : finds the color slide in the picture and wi@@ pe it without the rest .
mos@@ aic : divide the photo in rectangular cells and then created it , by filling with an average pixel value , new .
some effects need a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore break this calculation anytime with the button .
the drops are a nice small tool to make rain drops on your picture . this makes it possible to make natural your images a great look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n protected algorithm .
tropical size to change the size of the trop@@ ics . since the drop @-@ size does not grow automatically with the size of the picture , it is often necessary to reduce the size and density of drops . fish au@@ gen changes the optical effect of the drop in the picture .
you can stop using the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing a range free from rain@@ drops . use the range of tools to select the area , e.g. a face that will remain free . if you then start the filter drops , the area is free of rain drops .
this is an example of the shelf filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the mach@@ ined picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation so you can bring it by mirrors or turning into the right orientation . you can find the tools in the menu Transform@@ ers or transformer mirrors .
photo bub@@ bles is definitely one of the most widely developed tools in order to enlarge a picture at a minimum loss of image quality .
a picture to smaller is simple . the big question is how you can find a picture bl@@ asting and the details sharp ? how can you find the missing information or guess right ? the C@@ im@@ g algorithm is used here , makes it a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size you can change it onto the desired size with the size size . select a trans@@ forming size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog box is visible below .
the tool can change a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to switch the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool to blow up .
many image processing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. split line inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . &amp; digi@@ plug ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE Team of the GR@@ EC CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
you need to tell the tool like you want to change the size . these settings are available in the rider New size and are listed below :
keeping the aspect ratio : when this setting is activated , the aspect ratio of the original size is maintained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is needed . this is difficult if it is difficult to generate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos; tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be higher than 3 .
buttons Save as and store are used exactly . each entry for photo can be saved as text file and later re@@ loaded .
photo bl@@ ending is very fast when doing it , but it can still take very long and take a high CPU load after yourself . you can cancel the calculation anytime with the button .
you can see below an example of photo postcard by adding a small paint picture to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard magni@@ fication .
the cutting of a photos is not only a frequently performed surgery , but also a frequent in@@ valuable tool to create a picture . the mouse just need to create a picture with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drag the rectangle , then you will see this rectangle while you move your mouse over .
when you cut off the mouse button again the area of the photos will be cut out . by this you will get a good overview of your photo after cutting , by clicking on the corners of the rectangle , simply create a new rectangle with the left mouse button .
as soon as you are satisfied with the cutting section , use the button The button @-@ button of the image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries file Save or file Save below in the menu to save the newly designed photo .
in the preview area you can change the size of the rectangle by post@@ p@@ one the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog will maintain .
in the set @-@ up ratio , you can specify orientation as high @-@ format or lateral format . in the high format , the larger value of the height and in the lateral format of the width is assigned .
the tool goes with aspect ratio , which means that it is always equal , regardless of whether you use centimeters , in@@ ch or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog , there are two buttons to make the selection automatically horizont@@ ally or vertically .
below in the dialog you can set with the Max . Ratio of the section to cutting the maximum possible , depending on the selected ratio and orientation .
the tool goes after aspect ratio , setting its settings depending on the orientation orient@@ ations ( Horizont@@ al or Ver@@ tical ) . if you are using the input tool the next time , these settings are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so the EX@@ IF data are reflected the resulting image and not the original picture .
the settings of the mer@@ chan@@ ger help enable to insert your images better , so that you are better to summar@@ ize your pictures :
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic particles are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third organ , harmon@@ ic triangles are a possibility to share a rectangle in similar harmon@@ ical triangles .
golden middle : the golden middle is a pitch that is found on various natural growth models , such as the spiral of a Naut@@ ilus shell or the bl@@ ank@@ ets of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all possible things that we can find as beautiful .
the golden partition is the error number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and you already used to constru@@ ct your temple and pyr@@ am@@ ids . artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to put your cre@@ ations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; from where any number is equal to 1 equal to the sum of its two . one composition is as visual harmon@@ ious .
the golden center provides liquid lines available when you start a picture . these help will be recorded down below :
the Golden Spir@@ al will bring you good results for your photos . compared to third @-@ party nails , the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the picture . this type of composition runs along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual flow .
another rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . it should be something that the eye into the core of the composition . it can be a line or different objects . that something can be just there without the eye , it will fulfill his task .
the Golden triangles are also coming from the above @-@ mentioned golden spiral . their ver@@ tices are the middle points of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ic triangles , golden triangles are not equ@@ il@@ ateral triangles . diagonal to this lines can be extended to dynamic object .
when you use golden triangles around your frame , you will create a effect of professional photograph@@ ers dynamic Sym@@ met@@ ry . try your focus at one of the inter@@ sections and other visual information in the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can &apos;t reach any other way .
the Options Horizont@@ al mirror and Ver@@ tical mirror can be used to mirror the harmon@@ ic particles .
with the button color you can set the color of the auxiliary lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the help lines can be invisible . on this type , you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the Free rotation is a tool to rotate an image around any angle .
if you make a photo , then it happens easy to keep the camera not exactly vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which the things are turned around an angle . you can manually repair this with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Please choose trans@@ forming free rotation and adjust the target angle .
turn your image with the slide angle . the values on this sli@@ der are specified in degrees . with the kno@@ b you can set the sli@@ der back to 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture will be displayed on the right above .
for your help , the Free rotation is transmitted via a horizontal and vertical line . move your mouse over the two lines . after you move it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now , adjust the angle as described in the previous section .
after you have turned a picture , you will find un@@ desirable tri@@ angular holes in the corners . an option to repair it is to use this function transformer cutting from the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is automatic cutting . choose one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option sets the picture a bit after the rotation . however , note the above warning .
all per@@ tin@@ ent transform@@ ations are performed by a fixed point of the reference point . this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares in the corners of your picture . the preview will then be re@@ charged automatically . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which help you to change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty sections created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : shows the height of the new image including the empty sections created by the transformation , in pixels .
angle to the left : shows the current angle in degrees on the upper left corner of the transformed area .
right above : shows the current angle in degrees on the upper right corner of the transformed area .
angle to the left : shows the current angle in degrees on the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right below : shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective , the image will am@@ inated a little bit . for a single adjustment this effect is small , but two adaptations produce a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have changed the perspective , you will get un@@ pleasant tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to ber@@ some it is the picture with transform@@ ations cutting from the image processing .
the sc@@ oring tool is used to move a part of the picture in one direction and post@@ p@@ one another part to the opposite . this is no rotation , the image will dist@@ orted . with other words , a rectangle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module via transformer .
note your picture by using the horizontal and vertical angle . if you want to press the horizontal and vertical corners . if you want to default , the angles will be reset to zero . a preview of the effectiveness will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image are shown on the right of the preview range .
to your help you will end a vertical and horizontal line . move your mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the box tool to adjust your image .
after you have carried out the cabinet , the picture will become a bit deeper . for a single shift , this effect is usually neg@@ le@@ cted , but two ch@@ ings produced twice as much as impact and therefore you should avoid this .
after the shooting , the image has unusual tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate them is the picture with transform@@ ations cutting from the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ came ; requires a number of libraries and other pack@@ ets to read and write . the available formats depend on your system and , in some cases , from the type such as those libraries are comp@@ il@@ ated . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of images with &amp; digi@@ plug ;
due to this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all available file formats on their system . however , they will always find JPEG and TIFF ?
&amp; digi@@ plug ; shows only files in formats to know . this happens in the file extension and a comparison of this with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the image , you can change this list of file expan@@ sions the &amp; digi@@ arrived ; you can find further information in the following configuration .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allow you even to select the format . a detailed description of this file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ came ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression procedures to digital images . the redund@@ ant information is reduced to save the image data onto a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general there are better , smoo@@ ther results as JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also be saved without any loss if this is specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw material format , you can read in English using Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can find raw format images in JPEG or TIFF using the Roh@@ e Converter of &amp; digi@@ came ; you can find further information about the usage of modules with &amp; digi@@ came ;
&amp; digi@@ plug ; supports the store of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ b , which is included in &amp; digi@@ plug ; all support cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw form@@ ations that are supported by &amp; digi@@ plug ; supported :
many digital cameras support recording short films . these clips are often saved in Avi@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ came ; is not a film processing program and is therefore no film processing program . if you click on a film file , click &amp; digi@@ came ; the &amp; k@@ de ; Settings to play movies use to play the program .

many tools that need the photo editing are contained in &amp; digi@@ ous ; their description will follow here .
all image processing tools such as shar@@ pen@@ ing , soft@@ ness , noise suppression , reproduction , un@@ bl@@ ur@@ red , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog type before the filter is applied to the current picture . below , see &amp; quot ; texture user quot ; in this dialog box :
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current picture . links from it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the area . these modes are :
vertically split without dup@@ lic@@ ate . the left section shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the right of the selected spring area .
horizontal parts without dup@@ lic@@ ate . the upper section shows the original and the lower the bottom shows the filter below the selected pre @-@ look area .
vertically split . the left section shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
horizontal parts . the upper section shows the original and the lower part of the filter .
&apos; mouse over &apos; style : shows preview if the mouse does not look in the preview area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons which you can switch to show over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the colors can be adapted to the general setup page .
( 3 ) : the frame to choose from the preview . you can extract this frame with the mouse over the image and let go on the part of the picture you want to see . preview on the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons on your standard values . all settings can be noted from the last use of the module .
the side@@ bar properties shows the essential information about the selected image and is largely self explained . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo characteristics : shows a summary of the main parameters on the shooting of the photos . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when these are available .
this rider is an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble miniature audio program . press C@@ tr@@ l ; lin@@ ker mouse button to move a square . all images within this coordinates will be filtered and displayed . this is of course advance your images G@@ eo @-@ data .
&amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; is an editor for pall@@ ets files . the application can be used to edit color pall@@ ets and choose from colors to choose from colors .
the pall@@ ets files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de ; can either be installed for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case they are located in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Settings and hot user defined color and last used colors .
in the dialog box you can select from a list of installed pall@@ ets or browse the folder to files .
the cur@@ sor is displayed in the pallet screen as a line . it can be moved by clicking on a colour next to a color .
it shows the color to the color . the color is described under the pallet view . the color name may also be changed .
it can also be used to select such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor there . then move your mouse when pressing left mouse button .
if the check box is activated under the button color , the color is inserted from the color panel at the cur@@ sor . the color is inserted either or over@@ write a different ; depending on whether the mode should over@@ write . this mode allows you to select the check box over@@ write under the cur@@ sor position .
a selection , which has been described as described in the last section , can be used with the actions copying , cutting and insertion .
&amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; uses the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color , three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional color name , followed by a two @-@ line sign , if there are three numerical values in the clip@@ board , can be inserted as a color in &amp; col@@ col@@ ore@@ dit .

other required software : &amp; smart viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that requires the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of graph@@ s . needed in detail :
the main window displays the open graphics , each in a separate window . initially , if you can open &amp; k@@ graph@@ ically , the main window is empty as in the lower screen picture . in this case , the tool@@ bar contains only the symbol file and the ( empty ) list of last opened files . click the first icon to open the dialog file .
after you have one or more &amp; dot ; files have been selected , the main window looks like in the lower screen photo :
as you can see , there will be an overview in the corner when the graph is bigger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this product or select this position automatically .
use the m@@ imp@@ eller ( high and down without special keys , left and right when pressing and Alt ; -@@ key ) ;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below , you can see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the straight file has just changed in &amp; no@@ graphy ; loaded file from another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the graph should be re@@ loaded or if you want to ignore the change , so that later you want to change the change . if you want to change your decision later , you can use the menu settings for att@@ itudes ; use ... see also .
if you open a graph outside of a running &amp; k@@ not@@ ch ; instance , open , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; instance would like to display the graphics in a sub@@ window of the already running instance .
as with the last option you can save your choice permanent , but you can also change it with the setup dialog .
at program start , you can open all graph@@ s of your last meeting . again , you can save your choice both as well as later .
you can also define how the graph should be divided into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen .
if you use several pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graphics that go on one page will be igno@@ red on this page . in addition , the aspect ratio will be igno@@ red . if you have the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled from the respective parts of the graphite .
preview preview with one on several sites distributed graph@@ s without head@@ line and with a different fonts
the Site Re@@ ne@@ ut Char@@ ging gives the possibility to define the behaviour if a file is modified on the hard disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically re@@ load or modify the changes ) or the program every time .
the page opening is the possibility to define the behaviour of &amp; no@@ graphic ; fixed if a graph is opened outside a running session . you can open a default behavior for this case ( or in a window of the current session ) or determine that each time is asked .
the site &apos;s seat management provides the possibility to define the start @-@ behavior of &amp; k@@ not@@ ches . you can open a default behavior ( the files of the last meeting or not ) or determine where to be asked for every start .
the context menu , which usually starts with a click on the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n , opens up further possibilities :

if you use the module for the first time you will run through the process of creating a Tok@@ ens . this is therefore virtually your identification to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser is started to sign up in Fli@@ ck@@ r .
after successful login , the module can send photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r website . them will be presented the following page following a successful application .
simply connect the browser window and return to the program . after you have pressed Yes , you will get the dialog for upload photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section .
when the module exports to Fli@@ ck@@ r &apos;s second time , you will be greeted with the following dialogue , which shows the current access permission . the module currently does not require any other per@@ missions . you will be asked if you want to continue with these per@@ missions .
the button photos should be pressed once after you have set all other options . with this button you can also instantly upload photos . if you press on the O@@ k button , the up@@ loading of the photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r Server starts .
the Tags can be filled with a separate list of words . these are added to the image as keywords :
with the options open , friends and Fam@@ illi@@ e , you can set the access rights to your pictures . by default , photos are considered private .
if you select the option changing the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos are changed before up@@ loading in size . size is taken from the maximum size registered value .
the maximum size can be used to define the maximum height of the pictures . the size is thus modified that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module gallery is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing , please contact the ma@@ iling list of K@@ IP@@ I teams under k@@ de @-@ im@@ aging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ .@@ Note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical location allows to add GPS coordinates into the met@@ ad@@ ata of a picture and to process . the geographical data is stored in the EX@@ IF sample of the image and the loc@@ alization can be displayed in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization is available to loc@@ alize images geograph@@ ically in the spher@@ ical coordination system , which is used by GPS and Galileo . height , longitudinal and lat@@ itude grade are used .
to cor@@ related your images with geographical data you need a GPS track of XML file in the GP@@ X format . g@@ p@@ sb@@ abel and g@@ p@@ sman can download the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ograph@@ ical loc@@ alization of cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of selected images with a GPS track .
select the images that you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu on . the above @-@ looking dialog appears to load a possible correlation of time and loc@@ alization . this file contains of course data recorded at the same time , as the pictures of your camera .
if the file up@@ loaded a automatic correlation , the coordinates will be done in red . GPS track data is recorded in GMT @-@ time and therefore , the camera @-@ time is converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone . set up your camera zone .
the deviation for the maximum period of time is a upper deviation for the GPS time and camera @-@ time . the deviation is below , the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you do not have any trace data from one place for pictures you can edit the GP@@ X file and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ related all images in this area .
the options of the inter@@ pol@@ eren and difference in min. can be used if you do not have appropriate data . if you know that in reality a location in a large time difference between camera and GPS , you can set it here and then press the button cor@@ related to the inter@@ pol@@ der .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have a number of photos on the same place . since the dialog will use coordinates from a call to the next page you need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo .
the location may also be found and set to the shown map and increase this . in addition , select the appropriate region and increase this time . the height must always be selected manually . the card can always be selected manually . the card can be changed manually . the card can be changed between map mode , satellite image and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are ways to hang up the GPS data on the pictures . here &apos;s a small script that the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool is used to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery is a tool to export a set of albums in HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.0@@ 1 . you can select the albums which are exported to HTML pages and select the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is encoded with UTF @-@ 8 encoding .
the module has four riders in which the settings can be adapted to you . these albums are not allowed to choose to select the albums . the albums are not shown in hier@@ arch@@ ically . with the three buttons on the right hand you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area , the Al@@ ben@@ a preview and the text of the HTML page will appear .
the rider appearance defines the general look and layout for each side . this rider is largely self explained . if you then click on a picture on each picture will get a new page displayed in the picture . otherwise the picture will be displayed directly with your standard viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show , displayed
the rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be saved with all your corresponding pictures . select a folder that contains typ@@ ing . a sub@@ folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export that contains everything will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF data will be stored in the new pictures .
with other color depth , you can change the standard color depth . this also affects the file size . all other settings are self explained .
the rider preview images allows you to view some of the settings from the album riders for the images that are small images shown in the gallery .
a progress window displays the user to how far the action is . press to break down the process .
if the module produces the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the programs automatically . the web browser is started automatically by the end to display the preview of the gallery . press release to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I picture viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I viewer makes it possible to view a selection of images and use on them basis operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming , or offset . the viewer can be used with short @-@ speed and ma@@ sts . it was developed for fast image display and quick access to its functions .
after the start a picture is displayed in full screen mode . this can be changed in a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG L@@ oss@@ less module is a tool to change images without sacrific@@ ing your quality .
this module allows to store images listed below in JPEG format , without the usual losses to quality or met@@ ad@@ ata .
the consequence of the los@@ s@@ less storage is that the file size is rising as there is no compression of the colour information . this one finds it again in PNG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool that allows you to connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is currently no documentation . if you are interested in writing , please contact the ma@@ iling list of K@@ IP@@ I teams under k@@ de @-@ im@@ aging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ .@@ Note : the participants of this list speak English .

with the import function of the met@@ ad@@ ata module you can copy data from one image to another . then select the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the file image , so the image to which you want to copy the met@@ ad@@ ata . the data will be copied to the button OK .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere but not in any target format . JPEG is supported by writing . please check ex@@ iv@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a series of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide .
the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length , to convert . this module allows you to add a basic document crossing . you can also add an audio file in MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slide .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled automatically to the correct size for the selected video format . in addition , you can create a background color for the selected video format . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ VCD / SV@@ CD / VCD for your DVD player . to burn the media that you can use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
first you need to un@@ packed the images that are to be packed into MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au . after that , you can create the module via ex@@ tras MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au .
the images that are selected by you are then listed under image files in the portfolio . you can also change s@@ orting images or contents of the list .
after you &apos;re satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . if you need to select the other settings , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC , PAL is pre@@ set and most probably the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds which is displayed in seconds . the speed of the image is specified below . a lower value is produced very sudden , a high contrast is very smooth .
the background color can be set as next . in doubt , you should leave them black . the name and path of the generated file can be set in the name of MPEG @-@ output file . if possible , you keep the ending mp@@ g .
if you have to specify a audio file under the name of audio source file , then you can upload all the settings of the movie . depending on the speed of your computer you can easily go or drink a coffee , and enjoy the de@@ cel@@ au if you are back again .
if an indication appears that co@@ als or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick packages on the right below .
the printer assist@@ ent allows several pictures to print on a sheet paper together in standard Phot@@ o@@ sizes . these combined images can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is meaning@@ ful to improve or print using the Gim@@ p module for direct expression .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import your videos stored in the raw format in one of three formats to JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM respectively .
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ b of Dave Coff@@ in . we do not expect it from d@@ cra@@ b to get the same results as the software from your camera manufacturers . sometimes you get with d@@ cra@@ b better results ! .
first , select the RAW file to be converted and run the module . the R@@ aw @-@ image Converter window appears then in mode for a single picture . with the button preview can view the effect of your current settings on the picture .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides whether the camera settings are to be used for white , brightness and red / blue amplifiers . if the result is not optimal , you can further edit the image later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected , so you can use the contrast information . if your camera is working in RGB mode the R@@ GB@@ G switch has no effect .
as soon as you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the converter result . JPEG uses a los@@ s@@ less algorithm and produces for the smallest file sizes .
tagged Image Format , TIFF , ret@@ ains all information of your picture and uses the los@@ s@@ less L@@ Z@@ W compression .
if you prefer to edit your images , you should not use the JPEG format , as there is only a limited number of operations before the image quality wor@@ sen@@ ed . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you are interested in JPEG format , the met@@ ad@@ ata will contain the data stored in the JPEG file in the EX@@ IF file .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start converting the conversion . if you want to break this process again , you can use it .
the stack@@ ing mode allows you to convert various images to one time . use this mode therefore if you are safe , e.g. by testing on a single picture , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical with the version for individual pictures . however , this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , this is not available . however , the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images into an album . it &apos;s used to convert the program convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used for ren@@ aming of all photos of an album . you can use the pre@@ fix , the starting number and tim@@ est@@ amp of the tim@@ est@@ amp .
this module can be used to change the size of several images of a image collection . it can be used to sc@@ roll the image files from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . it can be sc@@ aled to the image or enlarge it will be provided four kinds of image changes :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is automatically selected , depending on the picture orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option e.g. to match your image format .
non @-@ proportional : proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed at this option .
printing : prepar@@ es the picture for photo printing . the user can adjust the printing resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , is correspon@@ d@@ ingly adapted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can send selected images with your favorite e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the sent pictures before . further pictures can withdraw from the list of the sent pictures .
after you started the module , the pictures window will be displayed with the selected images . via the button pictures you can add more images with a file selection dialog . for the most recently selected image will show a preview on the right @-@ hand side .
you can also drag images to the list list and put them to the list of sen@@ su@@ ing images .
with the button pictures , the selected images are removed from the list of sen@@ su@@ ing images .
after you have selected all the images you can open the new message -@@ Window of your e @-@ mail client . you will only need to add the addresses and the subject . the images are attached here as an app@@ endix .
don &apos;t pay attention to many images at once . most email accounts have limitations to send multiple emails if you want to send a good idea for sending e @-@ mails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window will be used to change the settings for sending images . your configuration is stored and can be used once again until you change it .
choose your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path to your installation .
if you use the Google Mail Service , you need to install the GM@@ UR@@ agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after the selection of comments in a shared file , the comments are added to the images into a text file and added the mail .
the PNG format among the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to any loss formats such as TIFF . you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast Internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG pictures file format and select the original files in JPEG format , then the original ex@@ i@@ f@@ data will be added to sen@@ su@@ ing images .
if the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically , so you can view the status messages in search of errors , however . your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically by the end . with the kno@@ cking button you can make this window sch@@ lie ? EN .
after starting the Module Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au , a window with questions like you want to view your slide show . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album .
the Open@@ GL @-@ trans@@ itions option is activated via Open@@ GL . however , you have to own a corresponding graphic card , because otherwise the slide will be very slow .
the file name option ensures that the fil@@ en@@ ame of images is displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in an endless loop . you can manually break it manually with Es@@ c .
the option pictures acci@@ dentally select that the images is displayed in a random order . it is not used the order of images in the album .
a delay between pictures can be set between the images . 1500 mill@@ ise@@ con@@ ds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . the best distance depends on your calcul@@ ator and the chosen output effect . you should be done so before you show the presentation of your friends !
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly select a different effect on each transition between pictures and pictures .
during the Di@@ j@@ au you can access a tool@@ bar at the upper left screen of the screen . move your mouse into this corner to turn you off .
with this tool@@ bar , you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next image and stop the slide .
at the left bottom of the screen you can see the current file names , the position of the current picture and the entire number of images in your presentation .

as soon as you have provided your images and videos with notes , you can see &amp; write pictures ; through these brow@@ ses , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the picture , so in persons , places and in group @-@ words entries are present .
in the browser window , you can see the categories , for which you have entered information when you have installed your images and videos with notes . additionally , there are entries to view the folder on your hard drive and of course the current preview images . the following is described in the following year .
if you are using the mouse on the entry , change the view of the browser . see picture .
if you are looking for a further person , the images are displayed on which both persons are visible . through this selection method you can restri@@ ct the number of displayed pictures from a few thousand pictures on a few individual pictures .
if you have selected all persons , places and other settings , you can view images with images to view images of your action .
in the picture , each person has the same symbol in front of their name . you can save with &amp; coffee album ; however , for each person a separate pre @-@ look , this applies to places , keywords and other categories you defined themselves . see here the picture .
to display images next to the name , select the button that you want to adjust the right outside on the tool@@ bar . note that you can view the view for any category separately . this has the advantage that you can choose to display symbols with images of persons and simultaneously a list of sample words ( if you have not own appropriate images ) .
you must choose to specify which image for each individual person is to be displayed . in order to see this , you need to select the picture @-@ saf@@ er window ( in closer ) and select the picture menu for the appropriate person . in the c@@ auti@@ ts window , you can select the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and can be selected as shown in the picture menu .
if you are searching for the entry window , you will view a dialog box that is very similar to the dialog for determining the image characteristics . this dialog can view it at the picture even once .
if you enter a string in the field of labelling or description , the labelling and descriptions of the images will be searched for this text . if you want to enter , you may also use a date of the whole date , i.e. for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window , you can see all images according to specific names , as you can see in the picture . here you will see pictures , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted .
this is the reference book for &amp; coffee album ; if you don &apos;t like to read manu@@ als , but rather prefer@@ able functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; Album ! and take a look at the quick release , the screen photos and the introduc@@ tory videos .
start the demo , if you start &amp; pick up in the first dialog for your first time , or pick up the menu for the first time , or select the menu for the menu entry . then some example will be loaded and you can test the features of &amp; c@@ ass album ; try out .
if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; you album ; as a related HTML document to download .
at the bottom edge of the main window of &amp; coffee album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar will see here : . as the name suggests , this l@@ ath show some data statistics on the pictures in your database .
the timing strip may show you several different time units . each strip indicates a different unit . you can switch between the units of years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by adding only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the time bar can be interactive to the following ways : you can select the displayed article preview from the database ( if you can select a date the first picture will appear in the preview image ) and also shows the tim@@ eline always displayed the current date of the currently displayed images , if you want to navigate in the preview pane .
you can also select a range of time bar by press the mouse button and select the mouse over the ruler of the time bar , so the time values are displayed . when you select a range , you can select the selection by clicking on a bar of the time bar .
&amp; lift album ; offers you two possibilities available to create HTML web pages with your images . the one is integrated in &amp; wired pictures ; integrated and the other as a module available ( see ) . in the following part of the user book , the integrated version described above the menu File ... read more .
before HTML pages you will need to make some settings . these are summar@@ ised in the three areas , layout , and target . in the following areas , every range is discussed .
first enter the title of the over@@ look and a description which should contain the HTML file later . in the album ; HTML sample pages , you will see an example of these settings .
next , select whether a &amp; lift album ; -@@ Export file is to be created on the over@@ viewing side . you can find additional information about export files .
you can select which information is displayed on the HTML pages . thus , you can avoid that information is displayed by a party . for example , all images are exported . currently all images are exported . you can therefore not use this setting to hide specific images from certain viewing .
in this area you can define which should look like the HTML pages . most import@@ ing options are clear , therefore it is not been received specifically .
at the bottom of the page you can adjust different resolutions for the pictures . this means you have to consider your web page and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution of 800x600 , no pictures more download the resolution of 1600@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewing of your site allows you to change the resolution at any time , so you can search your images with low resolution , as well as if it wants to get a picture larger , it changes to higher resolution .
in this entry area , place the various folders and the URL to your web site is stored .
at best , select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new sub @-@ folder for each subsequent proposition .
first you need to select the main folder where all your pictures will be saved . this folder will be saved and next time , you can select either a folder or select from K@@ DE support protocol , for example :
after you have created your images , you can check this really all for viewer . if you have created for the base folder a URL , if you have created the pages , this folder should be started . otherwise the web browser is in the incorrect folder .
if the files created by you are not yet in the final target folder you need to manually copy them . thus the import function , see , correctly works you need to specify the final objective of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folder are located .
the just described setup options have changed all three to base folders or UR@@ Ls . in these , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name is set in the output folder .
if you are looking at a meeting party , a meeting in the company , a conference or anywhere else , with other users of &amp; coffee album ; you may want to create a HTML page for viewing the images , people on the pictures , recording location , etc . , then you &apos;ll need to do with &amp; you album ; this job will not even make this work once .
you can import a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . you can import a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import other files in your database with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in the file if the images can be stored in the file or if it is in the file only a link to the file , that you can set all images together and this file is so independent . the obvious draw@@ back is however the file size .
you can export a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the menu File Converter ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with a HTML file , this will create an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file is looking for the images that are displayed in the file of .@@ k@@ im file . the corresponding images are not found , so the images of the URL that you have specified in the creation of HTML files . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML export .
in the following , the dialog for Export Pictures will exp@@ orting you to the Export File menu .
the most important option of this dialog box is if it is to act for internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are the following three selection options available :
when you copy the .@@ k@@ im file option , you need to copy the images into the same folder as .@@ k@@ im file .
with the option Autom@@ atically copied to the .@@ k@@ im file , copy &amp; c@@ tion@@ album ; the images automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most pictures have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worthwhile to comp@@ ress the files . if you like this , simply select the export file option .
the last option of this page is maximum image size limit . if you would like to send your friends pictures , as the .@@ k@@ im file otherwise very large would be . here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with the ending .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu File Recovery File ... Select , &amp; you album ; the exported database as described in .
the assistant to import@@ ing is made of four steps . first you need to select which images you want to import , afterwards , in which folder you want to import pictures .
it can be that you are the category people of imported file pers@@ onic ( if you are one dart ) , while this category is called for your database people , so you should be imported in the third dialog window , which are to be imported into the third dialog window , which correspond to the categories these in your database .
in the fourth step , you can select the categories of the imported file to the categories of your current database . an example for this is shown on the picture .
it must be simple to browse pictures and see : if you look at pictures you want to watch often within different picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash , if you want to discover images of your Italy vacation and see a picture with your friend you might want to see all images on which this friend is illustrated .
in this manual , you will find the different steps from ( 1 ) to determine information on your pictures , through ( 2 ) the search and see to run up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and adjustment possibilities .
K@@ Phot@@ o@@ album was started as a program to manage your pictures . but it was expanded and today it takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual it will be talking about images , but frequently , this also includes videos with one .
&amp; lift album ; stores all his information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of their images . this is a simple XML file that you can copy to a program of your choice , e.g. Normal backup tools , copy to a dis@@ kette or re@@ visions in CV@@ S , where you want .
&amp; you album , now refer to the folder where your pictures are saved and uses this in future Star@@ ts automatically . if you want to start a different folder with images , you can start &amp; you album ; with the -@@ c option . as an example : wired album -@@ c ~ / company / images / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
you can view the settings of the menu settings ; you can proceed to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ ills ; in the following section of the user book , the various setup options are explained .
on the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can call attention to preview and options for the viewer . for each setting it is possible to call through a button @-@ transfer to the F1 key and one click on the desired option .
it was described in you how you can define for each picture different features , such as persons , places and tags . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
you can see the dialog box to edit already existing groups . you can select a label and a symbol for any existing group .
sub@@ categories were already mentioned in the sub@@ category . in the dialog box you can set complete membership groups , i.e. , for example , all members of a group performed once in a group instead of all groups of a Medi@@ gli@@ eds as in .
in view the setup options you can choose to set up member types . you can select the category you want to configure . in the left @-@ hand side there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; lift album ; shares his modular system with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ plug and G@@ wen@@ view . this modular system means K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image plug@@ in interface . please contact information on the website of K@@ ip@@ i .
the modules can be called via the modules . the modules can not be described and are not described in this manual because they are not part of &amp; glasses ; however , most modules have a help page that you can call on the modules itself .
since the modules used by multiple applications can be used together , it is possible to test the modules with &amp; k@@ ills ; for example , you should always call the demo database before you call the command line with the command &gt; k@@ photoelectric album -@@ Demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu Help . do not say , I would not warned !
applications that use the modules via K@@ IP@@ I are very different , thus it can be that some modules with &amp; c@@ ass album ; not work . this is the dis@@ advantage if you share functions with different applications .
the largest difference between &amp; coffee album ; and other applications , which can also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications can do their pictures in albums . even if &amp; you album , this kind of order is not supported , sim@@ ulates the order for some modules , so that you can use the features with &amp; k@@ shafts .
sim@@ ulates &amp; wired album ; the latest album , which is just the current view , so all the images that shows you at the moment .
in addition to the current album &amp; lift Album ; the modules have also been presented a list of albums . here is a couple of pictures , as follows :
when &amp; you album ; s browser shows the contents of a category , e.g. all persons , then each entry represents this category a record for the module .
or it is the category you have set in the setup dialog as a category for virtual albums . for example , if you &apos;re using the category people , it will do &amp; you album , so if you have selected persons to view and pass this .
since some modules with &amp; lift album ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the setup dialog , and choose the modules installed which modules are loaded .
on the picture you can see an example of a starting screen as soon as you book &amp; sli@@ deshow ; with your own pictures .
as you are acc@@ ust@@ omed to see from any other K@@ DE application , you can see the window with which you have entered your image database . currently , it contains no information about your images . in the section we will look back to this window , now please click on the entry images that shows you an overview with all existing images .
one of the main features of &amp; coffee album ; is the possibility to view each image with notes , where the picture has been recorded so . you can set each image either individually or for a larger number of images certain notes . if , for example , on all images of Jes@@ per , and all images taken in Copenhagen .
all these remarks can be used for searching and Brow@@ se if you want to read in the section if you want to see this remarks if you use the built @-@ in viewer .
in you can see three lists with a text field by using persons , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; coffee album ; because you will always use them if you enter information about your pictures .
the following idea is the shift of images within the list : if you have a family party , and on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 persons can be seen , so you can re@@ locate the used name to the top that can find people faster and arrange them .
if you prefer to get an alphabetical list of alphabetical list , please click the icon for s@@ orting after date below the list .
if you have selected comments for each picture you would like to edit any images and apply these images with notes . click this case easily to the above and back buttons , which are located under the preview of the picture on the top right .
if you have several pictures , e.g. using the same person , then it can be more convenient to select all these pictures and to use the menu option added to once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all over the USA . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California .
on the picture you can view a browser window that shows the USA as a super@@ group . to indicate that it is a special icon is displayed .
in the context menu of the background dial@@ ogs it is possible to add one entry to an existing or new sub@@ category . in addition , you can also select one entry to a category and put it in order to make this entry into a sub@@ category . attention , this requires that you &apos;ve just alphabet@@ ically their categories in alphabetical order .
you can post@@ p@@ one the individual elements of a curious dial@@ ogs by clicking the vest , which form the edge of the frame , click and post@@ p@@ one . you can also make a separate window by using it outside the window area .
if you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs , you are satisfied with the settings , click on the button options ... , which offers you the opportunity to save the current structure and the look of the window .
you can also make a frame completely fl@@ ashing . if you want to see this window later , use the button options ... and then window a / out . this process can be seen in the picture .
if you select the entry images in your browser , you will find an overview with preview images of the currently selected images , or any images , if you have no filter . you can choose the size of preview images , by simply down@@ wards clock@@ face to the mouse with the middle mouse button , configure . try it simply .
if you have a picture on the background of your desktop , this image will be set up as background picture for your desktop .
when you click on a picture , this picture shows the picture shows . if you are not open a window with a picture viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete pictures in the image preview . simply select the corresponding pictures from you want to delete or select either the removing button or select in the menu Edit menu . now you will show the window that you can see in the picture .
&amp; you album , you can use &amp; feel free for this problem . of course , you can also use &amp; c@@ ass album ; for example , you can also use the pictures somewhere on the hard drive . in the picture you can see the view of &amp; c@@ ass album ; if not all the required images can be loaded from the hard disk .
pictures where the right upper corner is cut , are not stored on the hard disk . for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , however , these pictures are present , so &amp; you can see the preview of these pictures . you can also view these pictures with the picture viewer .
as you can see this function you need to copy and copy them into your folders . if you want to avoid these files from folders . if you want to avoid trouble if you want to avoid another hard drive to store all pictures you want .
in the menu pictures you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to make a little more privacy , you can see the images so that you can see for other un@@ accessible and click on current view , you can also see all the images that you can see your little sister , and dial everything except at the current view .
thus you have set the images to be hidden in the case of your little sister , select the menu entry images that you have blocked off . if you want to have closed the pictures you want to get locked . if you want to get the pictures again , click on lock .
it is also possible to set a password which must be entered for un@@ lock the images . to set this password , simply select password in the menu privacy .
please consider that this picture protection does not want to read or delete all images on the hard disk and on the other you can read out the password as an un@@ coded text or delete . this kind of password protection serves only that those who are using &amp; k@@ ills ; not very familiar to for@@ bid the view on private pictures .
the reason why you can view all your pictures with &amp; k@@ shafts , of course you would like to view it . from this reason , you &apos;ll want to view it . from this reason , you can view it . from this reason , you can view it from the preview as described in .
the viewer can be seen in detail . it shows the picture , but additional all information that you have to enter about the image , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc .
if the Info@@ box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , so you can also configure what information is displayed and if any information can be displayed . all these options are available in right click on the viewer . that is then published in the context menu , you can see below .
some words in the Info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you were selected persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene had chosen .
if you have several pictures in the viewer you can use between them and go back by clicking the keys picture high and picture . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and at the end . these functions can also be reached from the context menu .
if several pictures are loaded on the viewer , you can run it as a slide show . then a new picture will be controlled by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l button and Plus or Min@@ us . start and stopped by the buttons C@@ tr@@ l ; S .
a very beneficial owner of the viewer &apos;s photo album ; it is possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and to switch back .
when you use the viewer , you can easily pull down a rectangle with the mouse button . with the min@@ us button you can look back down the Plus button in the middle of the picture shows how a zoom @-@ rectangle is marked and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
with the point button , you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not shown on the zo@@ oms , so that every pixel on the screen is equal to a pixel of the image .
note that the only zo@@ om@@ operations will work with videos that come in and zo@@ oming with the Plus@@ - and minus sound .
with the shooting functions from the context menu , you can rotate the image . this does not work with videos . you can note notes to the current picture with the menu item notes from the context menu .
if you have a look at the picture you can see a picture with a person whose name you forgot to break down on the picture . in the moment you can watch the image and configuration dialog of the image to select this name . however , you may consider only the picture to select and further pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures on a printer to get the images on paper . to see what photos you want to start the viewer with the images and select it as good or bad , while you want one after the other .
for both examples above , the viewer will have the possibility to view images with features , while you can view it . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature that you can press the corresponding letters . in view a picture in which the characteristics A , B and C are set .
as soon as you have set features on your images , these are available in your browser . so you can view all images that you want to print , print or whatever you always have to comment . this is described in . after that you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and especially features can be displayed in the preview view . if you can view categories in D@@ re preview view , then you can add features to the pictures by clicking the letters for the feature , after the picture was selected . you can see here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case you allows you to paint and paint on the picture .
the ground is not saved with the image , but in the database . on the way you can make your cold later re@@ viewing .
you can see a picture on the painted image . in order to switch the painting mode from &amp; k@@ shafts , in order to finish the painting in the context menu . to end the painting , you simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar above the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; work , you have to have the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not complete , but the documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you be read and understood .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then the properties tab are displayed in the object properties and the object is shown in the wire rope sight yellow .
you can also select several objects at the same time , but not the object of an already selected object , as all accommodation objects are selected already with the object .
to insert a new object into the property tree , select the position you want to insert and click either to the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu .
there are more storage positions , the following spl@@ itting menu will be mounted , so that you can choose the right position :
with del@@ eting either from the menu bar or from the context menu of the right mouse button you can select selected objects from the scene .
if you have changed properties , click on applic@@ ator to take these changes . if you have entered the inv@@ alid values , you can read the input error and then click on applic@@ ator or re@@ ject the changes .
when you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; enter the user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the quoted object with help .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download them here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
if you have a texture or a part of a texture , you can see a preview of the Capital view .
press a preview of the scene file and a small example of the scene will be selected with the chosen texture . if you want to select a type of texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the whole texture map ) , cross country locally .
the screen photo shows the camera points . you can move these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , disappear control points and it will display a small cross in the wire @-@ model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shi@@ fts . you can change shift by pulling out with the mouse within the entire window .
each object has a visible level . you can specify this value relative to the visibility level of the above property or as absolute value . objects will be displayed if they are selected or their visibility level or equal to the visible level of the scene in the tool@@ bar .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; has a window order than pres@@ et@@ ting . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right .
if you do not like the default window order , or if you need another arrangement , you can easily set them anywhere . you can also save several window orders and simply switch between different orders .
to make a window over or under a present view , drag the beginner to the top or bottom edge of a view . a rectangle shows the new position .
to create a new column , drag the beginner to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then an@@ cho@@ red on the right or left side of this view and covers the entire height .
if you want to arrange several views over each other , drag the beginner to another view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the boxes card reader above .
the last possible window arrangement is suspended views : views that are not en@@ shr@@ ined in the main window . to solve a view from the fixing system , drag the beginner to the desk or click on the small pointing left at the Beg@@ inn@@ bar .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the Anf@@ al Bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can add additional views in the main window . in the menu View you can find entries for any type of views . new views are floating , you can make it on any spot .
the current window view can be saved with view window order . it will be shown a dialog where you can save the window order under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can render them ren@@ ders . &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for ren@@ dering , this program must be installed properly . as this manual was written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to ren@@ dering the current scene , click the icon of Ren@@ ders on the tool@@ bar or select the menu entry option .
a R@@ ender mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s IN@@ I files . it determines the image size and quality of ren@@ dering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels you can insert arbitr@@ arily many R@@ ender modes , from a fast preview up to full quality .
if you click on the icon The R@@ ender settings in the tool@@ bar or in the menu View ... select , the following dialog will be opened :
each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but a name that can recognize the characteristics of mode .
in the map size you can register the width and height of the rendered image . if you only want to ren@@ dering a small area of the image , select the check box and enter the image cut into the input fields .
in combination @-@ field quality you can select the features , the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; for ren@@ dering . this is used by a very simple colour and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user retro @-@ illumination . a detailed description of the R@@ ender features can be found in the user manual and P@@ ov@@ ray ;
if a picture is rendered by only a ray of pixels , you can create different errors . these pictures often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or step @-@ effects in curves and lines , plus details are not displayed if they are smaller than one pixel . this effect is ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of this error . in general , pictures with this property is better .
if you turn off anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than a beam per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as a standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; the second method is adap@@ tive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively because each pixels is again divided and adap@@ tive because the re@@ trac@@ sion@@ ing depth depend on the calculated color values .
if you select the first method , POV @-@ Ray tra@@ ce@@ ases a ray of pixels . if you adjust the difference between pixels using a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling , if you adjust the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 is calculated using an extra value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays each .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
diff ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) and abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between the shades is divided , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub@@ pixel , which will be pursued individually and checked on further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of records can be set to the depth value .
another possibility to reduce ali@@ asing effect is the creation of smo@@ kers for the beam process , called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you turn J@@ itter@@ ing , changed &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays to avoid regular patterns .
the latest setting for quality of the ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light refle@@ ct@@ ance is calculated . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property .
on this card map you can adjust whether the alpha channels are to be calculated using POV @-@ Ray . one pixel is then transparent if the corresponding R@@ ays have no object .
open a new window for displaying the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; account issue . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly , you can find the reason here .
to import an &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; scene , select the menu entry file import@@ ing and select a file in the dialog window .
currently , &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; not yet the full command of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; if when import@@ ing error messages or war@@ nings , a dialog window displays a list of all messages .
if you do not want to use source text in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; import this source between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ End .
you can extract objects from the object tree into the editor to import the source text for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; to import objects in the editor to import objects into the scene , select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copying and insert in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; and in your editor , you can also add Source for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also in your editor .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; a scene will render . usually this p@@ ov@@ ray or x @-@ p@@ ov@@ ray .
if you click on the own website , click &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; a user documentation to the displayed object . set here the path to your re@@ tention and version . the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 will be supported .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; sear@@ ches for external files ( for example height level data ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ Li@@ braries . if you are not in the folder of the scene , you must enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different path of the library , the first found file will be used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
colour to control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected check@@ points .
the color of the rectangle for the visual field in the camera view and in the window type plate .
you can adjust the object of points to the grid in the context menu of wire @-@ model views . you can set the grid separately for shi@@ fts , sc@@ aling and turns .
larger values indicate an accurate wire model and thus a better sewing unit for the displayed objects require more time to ren@@ dering . for some objects , such as the sphere , you can set the detail level for two directions .
if you are looking for extended proj@@ ections for extended proj@@ ections , all the proj@@ ections are further divided into the camera , all proj@@ ections are used . advanced proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions to perspective and vertical proj@@ ections . this property makes a better approach to proj@@ ections , but requires more time to ren@@ dering .
when you cross the wall , a wall is mounted behind the objects . the wall is displayed in a box pattern of two adjustable colours .
if you cross the ground , a floor below is mounted under the objects . the floor will be displayed in a box pattern of two adjustable colours .
if you activate channel glasses , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method for the ren@@ dering of the scenes is used . the values for depth and sw@@ elling can be set . precise information on parameters can be found in the Section R@@ ender modes .
on this page you can modify existing window orders or create new window orders . in the section window orders will explain how to create and store window orders .
the combination @-@ panel standard configuration : shows all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; used the chosen window order at the start of the program .
the list Ex@@ hib@@ itions are showing all existing window orders . a new arrangement can be created with the button and removing a selected arrangement with the button .
any window order is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list below shows all views of the chosen window order . new Vi@@ ews can be created with the button and removing selected views with the button .
the position of the new window . with Neue column , create a new column on the right @-@ hand side of the existing window , with un@@ matched window , you will receive a cart@@ card view with the previous view and en@@ cap@@ turing a view of the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you have just &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; and now you want to follow any more accurate knowledge of both programs . if you can follow all steps in this tutorial , you should make the ultimate but simple scene under beginners : a ball on a plane .
but you should make the following warning : before you can compl@@ ain that you only use a black screen . if you use a 3D program for first time you should consider these important rules :
if you do not adjust the camera , no rules can be applied to the ren@@ dering , as a result you get a black image .
if you don &apos;t insert a light sources , your entire scene is in the dark and you will receive only a black image .
if you have any error @-@ free installed , see the first start of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; the following pre @-@ installed window order :
take a little time to meet the menus and the existing symbols of the tool@@ bar . read the documentation that you can expect a reasonable presentation , what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols frequently , so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this tutorial , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu entry dialog . thus you have a scene without objects .
the wireless model view shows how the camera shows the entire scene you create . in particular , note the scene from the camera view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the view@@ point of the camera . this shows the result of the scene of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the designation camera . if you click on it , see the contents of the object properties that find the various parameters of the camera . in the user documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; you will find further details .
do not change anything at the basic settings of the camera , this is later instructions , but note that the camera will change into the control points , with which you can change the camera point of the camera . simply click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired position .
when you press the kno@@ b or the input button , the wire views and the object tree can immediately change according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the camera view .
there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . for example , you could set a qu@@ ader ( In@@ sert Body ) and size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is an in@@ compreh@@ en@@ sible method for the solution of this task .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; actually , it offers a simpler way . you can use an infinite plane than floor :
a good advice : select the plain in the object tree , change the name and press the button on user or input button . in the object tree the new name is displayed immediately .
the wire @-@ model view also shows the plain , even at the moment only a limited level . when you ren@@ dering the scene , the plane extends to the horizon .
if you can see the object tree accurately , you will notice that you can click the entry + before the object . in this case you can see the options for any new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , also change the possible settings in view of the object properties .
in this scene you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the horizon line , so that you should know some of these parameters . select shi@@ fting and set the values as follows :
choose the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose a bit multiple .
in both cases a dialog opens in which you can choose to select how the object is displayed . you can change the name in the property panel ( name = bottom @-@ pigment ) , with a click on the button preview see how pigment looks now .
of course , the preview of the pigments only shows a matte black material , because you can always check the appearance of materials any time with a click on preview . give now the colors for the pigment one . too , there &apos;s many possibilities now , but take it now the sim@@ pl@@ est .
if you are looking for a preview no color on Qu@@ ader and Ball , click on the kno@@ b and call the preview .
the material for the floor is now correct . if you render your image now with a click on the icon , you should receive the following result :
of course you are not the color list . you are still necessary further settings . in the colour list you need to enter two new attributes . then , select this entry twice ( you can also do it more frequently , but the chess board color list can only be used only with two colors ) :
select in the object tree every time and change the colours in the object properties :
this step , you should already simply execute the basic work@@ ings of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; already , the ball can be just as simple as the floor :
in view of the object properties you can change the settings . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( do not forget to push the input button or the button on the floor . otherwise , the ball would be suspended above the ground , as you have moved the bottom around a unit down@@ wards .
of course the ren@@ dering is now a strange result : as already before , the ball @-@ surface appears like a matte black material . set in the following step a suitable material .
if you have selected the sphere , you can now assign a material . as already on the ground , enter the ball a pigment as color :
select the most important accommodation project and change the name for example in sphere of pigment . click on the sphere of pigments , then choose one @-@ colour and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve interesting effects if you take time to set some finish properties :
then change the values like in the following screen photos and click on user or press the input button .
the settings of brightness and reflection have already revealed good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrom@@ ed surfaces , even if metal : even not selected :
you should now have a good impression what possibilities you have &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; hop@@ efully you have already learned as much as you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
if you are a scene ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing , the Ren@@ derer hypo@@ thet@@ ical rays coming from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that illumin@@ ates the scenes ) by any pixels in the scene . the R@@ ender will act and broken the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how the atmospheric effects will work as the example of fog . so the scene pixels is processed for pixels .
as you can imagine , you will see nothing to see the camera with which you see the scene . without a light source you can see nothing , the picture is simply black . obviously , every scene need to be locked , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file selection you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the default file you can select a file you have previously tested with &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ;
whenever you can open a new model or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
have the model already stored , it will be stored under the same name . if it &apos;s a new file , you must enter a name and one space .
the scene in the last stored version recovered . all changes since the last storage will be rejected .
you can only select this menu entry only if you do not have any stored changes in the scene .
repeat the last modified command . select this menu entry you can only select if you have to use Edit menu .
saves the current window order and opens a dialog in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or an existing arrangement .
in this menu , you can find options for the setting of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; , here you can change the appearance , the key root and the default behavior .
opens a dialog for changing the keyboard short@@ cut . you can change or add commands to this option to change or add commands to this option ?
opens up a dialog for setting up the tool@@ bars . you can add tool@@ bars for &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; commands Add and remove .
one B@@ ump @-@ map is a way to allow har@@ sh surfaces without changing surfaces , without changing the geomet@@ ric shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file to use a B@@ ump @-@ map as well as for a texture map .
basic body are simple geomet@@ ric shapes that can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens of dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models will continue to be mach@@ ined to give them a realistic appearance .
a texture map is a possibility to give the surface of an object color on pixel @-@ basis , by application of a picture file as colour card .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application features a file browser where you can select images to display .
images can be displayed in an own window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can click with click on &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the return key .
you can set it if any image is displayed in a separate window , or whether all images should always be used the same window .
if you are searching for a specific file , select the first sign of fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field is found in the right corner . if a matching file name was found , the file is highlighted by clicking by return or &amp; Es@@ c ;
in the dialog setting - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; there are five card cards . in three of them , General and editing and sli@@ deshow , you can adjust the working instructions and short commands for the browser , you can set the key root for the respective window .
if this screen has been selected , then the images will be open in full screen mode . if the image is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display surface is filled with background color , which can be set below . default is not a full screen mode .
if this item is enabled , load &amp; ku@@ d show ; already the next picture in the folder , while you still do the current picture . this reduces the delay when you choose the next image , and is especially suitable for a slide show .
this option saves &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; when trying the name of the last modified folder . at the next start , &amp; ku@@ das Show ; this folder will open in the browser window .
click on the colored bar to select a background color . this is used to fill in the background of screen mode in full screen mode . if window mode is bigger than the image , the background is filled with the selected color .
you can see &amp; read show ; so that only some of the file types will be displayed , which can also display the program .
this option increases the display window to the full screen for large images . this option is enabled as default .
specify whether the sli@@ deshow will start with the first picture in the folder or with the selected image .
the time span between the image changes at a slide show . to change the value , you can use a new value to the input field or the sli@@ der or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
the number of repet@@ itions is set to 0 , the sli@@ deshow is set to 0 , until they change from the user . to change the value , you can use a new value to the input field or the sli@@ der or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . the default is 1 .
change the key root for the different operating modes of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the map postcards short commands for the ad window and short commands for the browser .
with this option , switch between the two @-@ line view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for files ) and the partial view of file system with folders and files in one window .
shows large symbols for the files in the folder . this ad is possible only in short notice .
shows little symbols for the files in the folder . this ad is possible only in short notice .
shows preview images for files in the folder . this ad is possible only in short notice .

like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ photo ; an open source project . this means it depends on how the user wishes to join its part , at least problems and possible improvements .
&amp; show@@ photo , makes it easy as possible to report any errors or possible improvements . this shows a dialog with a link . if you use this , your browser opens a page to reports of problems and wishes . all the information is already completed , and you can simply follow the instructions to order your message .
&amp; show@@ photo , is a project supported by a community . so that users and developers are able to help one another . if you are interested in a more common users of &amp; show@@ photo ; we can see here any questions about other users of &amp; show@@ photo ; they will be able to answer any questions about other users . however , this mail@@ ing@@ list is spoken in English , you should be able to be able to use this language .
the best start to join &amp; show photo ; to participate , it is the developer of ma@@ iling list . instruction to join the developers ma@@ iling list from &amp; show@@ photo ; .
&amp; show@@ case , try to give you much control of its work processes as possible . in order to access these settings , you need to set up in the Settings menu ; setup dialog box is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these settings by pressing the symbols of the left .
in the area of exposure indicators you can select the colour when the under@@ - or over@@ exposed indicators should select the colors with what you should display , in contrast , a bright color and over@@ exposure has a dark colour display .
the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; has a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides you important information and promotions to the selected images . you can also view it in the image processing . you can view this in which you click on one of the five riders :
&amp; sk@@ ip@@ ite ; is an application for scanning images that do not make more than images to scan and retri@@ eve .
&amp; sk@@ ip@@ ite ; is a simple application for scanning images that do not make any more than images to scan and retri@@ eve . &amp; sk@@ ip@@ ite ; can save the images immediately in a specified folder with automatically generated name and format . users can also show the pictures before departure .
you can check the status of your scanner at the s@@ ane project to enter the information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ projected .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ p@@ l .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line from &amp; sk@@ ip@@ ite ; with the command sk@@ ip@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner can not be opened , or if no standard sc@@ anners , then a dialog will be opened to choose the scanner .
the user can select the scanner and press OK to open the scanner . ref@@ res@@ h and exit the scanner .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ et@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not affect these options .
in order to push a picture , the user can only start a preview and then select the scanning area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button .
in order to select the picture better , the user can zoom into the image and select from the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom that fits the full preview of the window .
if the image has been selected then the final image can be read with the scanning button .
if the store is selected in the settings , then the image will be displayed in a preview window , as shown below is displayed , then the image will be saved and sh@@ y ? EN leads to a break and you will get back into the main window .
by the button settings the same name dialog will be opened before the main window . you can change the main settings here .
users can view the image if desired , before saving . in this case the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this is not desired by the user , the option must be selected .
this setting allows them to select the art such as &amp; sk@@ ip@@ ite ; images stores the dialog box to store every picture opens up the dialog before each saved image . if &amp; sk@@ ip@@ ite , it will automatically save to a gen@@ eric name in a previously defined folder , then you need to select Save without a file name .
this setting defines where the images in the option will be stored without a file name . if the images are stored in any scan , then this folder will be used as a standard for the store . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ....
this parameter defines a image pre@@ fix for the automatically storing pictures and is furthermore the proposed name for the image in the dialog for saving . the automatically saved picture gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix of each time when a picture is stored . the string # # # will be replaced by the numbers .
the user can custom@@ ize the image quality . this value changes also the compression value for saving . if select the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the button help starts the K@@ DE help with the &amp; button ; the button About the K@@ DE About -@@ dialog for &amp; sk@@ ip@@ ite ; . the button settings shows the dialog for Settings and Connect can be used to stop &amp; sk@@ ip@@ ite .

you may also configure existing multimedia keys so that they work as &amp; am@@ arok ; -@@ Short commands will work . this will make your keyboard to &amp; am@@ arok ; -@@ Control Centre .
the D@@ COP interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions which can usually be found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and should describe the D@@ COP functions of collection , context @-@ browser , player , playlist , playlist , playlist and scripts . a sample call for the D@@ COP @-@ function might break &amp; z@@ b ; such as :
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition , Amar@@ ok still supports some of its own command @-@ options options .
you should give a feedback if the script can &apos;t be executed due to a lack of depen@@ dency . please check in your script if all the required modules are available and use dialog when the user does not run .
Beg@@ in require &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ error error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ binding V@@ 3.4 is . &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit
in the file scripts , you can use a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use it as a basis for your own scripts , or simply expand the required functions . you will soon determine that the letter from scripts is relatively easy .
using D@@ COP , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p ; which should defeat any K@@ DE installation .
most scripts themselves enable the result of external programs and commands . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easy . here , an example in Python :
&amp; am@@ arok ; sends al@@ er@@ ts to all current scripts . in this reason , scripts were able to monitor their standard entries and respond correspon@@ d@@ ingly to events . of course , a script can also ignore the events when there is no use .
configure the script to display the setup dialog . to store the store and loading of the setup data must take care of each script . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the work folder to the folder where all data should be stored .
track@@ Change is sign@@ alized that a new piece will be played . the script could now be &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ COP @-@ functions further information on the new piece ( for example , the met@@ ad@@ ata or the unit length ) .
volume Change of new@@ volume signals a modification of the volume . the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ ised Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : - Inclu@@ des the path to the selected files of the playlist , if a custom menu entry can be used . to add an entry file , you can use the D@@ COP @-@ function d@@ co@@ p am@@ arok script add@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Item ( sub@@ menu ) to remove d@@ co@@ p am@@ arok script @-@ e@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Item ( Sub@@ menu ) .
before &amp; am@@ arok ; termin@@ ate or if the user will stop a script , send &amp; am@@ arok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to do . for example , saving data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ ah script administration can also install script packages that can be compressed using the user &amp; z@@ b ; such pack@@ ets can be compressed using b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) that the user can clearly recognize the archive using b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) so that the user can clearly recognize the archive as Amar@@ ok @-@ script package .
&amp; am@@ arok ; 1.3 will accept only script packages with the expanding amar@@ oc@@ script . for this reason , you should ren@@ ame your script packages immediately .
the main cre@@ pt must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the rest of the lad@@ ling modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to obtain the file rights :
if your script package is ready , you can upload it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wik@@ i scripts page of &amp; am@@ arok ; attached . for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category am@@ arok ; scripts .
&amp; am@@ arok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; am@@ arok ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless highly sur@@ pris@@ ingly easy to use .
with &amp; am@@ arok ; you can simply select music simply into the playlist , rather than you must purchase through endless menus . perhaps you may find only a quite certain title from thousands of your collection . with &amp; am@@ arok ; &apos; s collection @-@ browser and the quick search will find the piece within seconds .
perhaps you have already a few playlist , but can never decide what you want to hear ? then if the playlist , it is still difficult for you . and if you are still difficult , the dynamic mode and smart playlist , select the right music after certain criteria .

for the music files , this function is only available when compiled &amp; am@@ arok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the settings folder by &amp; am@@ arok ; normally ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / am@@ arok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
external browser : lets you choose which browser is created by &amp; am@@ arok ; it is required when a browser is needed .
other browsers use : here you can specify the path to another browser that is not found in the list .
playlist to save , stores the current playlist , automatically stores the current playlist , if you don &apos;t want to lose this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist .
relative paths for manually stored playlist , If you activate this setting , will use &amp; am@@ arok ; relative paths to the music files , based on the storage location of the playlist , otherwise the absolute position of music files is saved .
current pieces will keep visible on the new window that the playlist window will stop - / roll to keep the current one in the visible window range .
when you change the context of the context @-@ browser changes automatically the context @-@ browser , once the next piece is played .
in the section of appearance you can custom@@ ize &amp; am@@ arok &quot; s appearance . the section is divided into three parts sub@@ section .
in the font section you can use the use of different fonts in &amp; am@@ arok ; you can select the fonts for the following fields : playlist windows , player windows and context browser . press on select ... so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog .
with the selection @-@ defined color scheme , you even have the qu@@ al of choice and can set up an own color scheme . use the choice including activated color selection for front and background color .
play at the start causes that &amp; am@@ arok branches ; after programming the playback is automatically continued , with which it stopped at the last closing time .
the Under@@ window On @-@ Screen display allows you to watch the on @-@ screen of the O@@ SD . when on @-@ screen display , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview .
the first option is the font . click select ... to select from the dialog to select the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box is that the text is illustrated in the O@@ SD .
custom colors use the option to adjust the O@@ SD colors for font and background . a click on the colour surfaces opens the dialog for color selection . if O@@ wn colors are not activated , the pre @-@ set &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ colors are used .
the input field text indicates the text in the O@@ SD . by default , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your own needs . below , you will find a list of the available space holders and what they mean .
the screen is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . so you can define which the screen of a multiple @-@ monitor environment should appear in the O@@ SD .
the Map Audio output allows you to select an audio driver from the selection field . some drivers enable further adjusting possibilities in this card map .
the card collection is used for setting all settings for your collection . this includes the folders and the type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folder which want &amp; am@@ arok ; according to music files , select the check box in addition to its name . this section contains also check boxes for setting , as with the selected folders .
sub@@ directory recur@@ sively : this causes that &amp; am@@ arok ; both the crossed and their sub @-@ folder as well as their sub @-@ folders .
changes : enables &amp; am@@ arok ; to monitor the selected folders to monitor ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . Moreover , an incre@@ mental search will be carried out to make the necessary modifications to your collection .
import@@ ing any playlist , causes that &amp; am@@ arok players will add to your collection in your collection folder ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . then , the enclosed re @-@ playlist , then appear later in the playlist @-@ Browser .
the part collector database is used to choose a database for the collection . the combination box driver : can be selected between SQ@@ Lite or MySQL . if MySQL is selected , another device is needed in the window .
the MySQL setup will be used to set the database for &amp; am@@ arok . under the computer : if the computer is entered , it is entered into the database : the network port is entered under the database name . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use user@@ name : and password : to enter the data required for the connection to the database .
the card del@@ im@@ .@@ f@@ m supports the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; am@@ arok ; can provide the names of played pieces at a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations concerning the current product .
here , enter your user@@ name and password for your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you have no profile , you can register one onto the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send the checked pieces and thus actu@@ ating the profile : this setting allows for it &amp; am@@ arok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
similar interpre@@ ters : after activation of this setting is made &amp; am@@ arok ; a list of similar interpre@@ ters at the always played piece . note : you can &apos;t need the list in the context @-@ browser . note : you don &apos;t need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function .
&amp; am@@ arok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . further information can be found in the summary of functions and gallery with screens .
am@@ aro@@ K requires only the c@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you need to find K@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the programs contained , because &amp; am@@ arok ; needs some of them to find such as modules or scripts ) . we have written a small tutorial on how to compiled K@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some functions such as the O@@ SD require that your window manager will keep the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work for example , but Flu@@ x@@ box will work for example . we try to support am@@ aro@@ K on all platforms , therefore we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because these represent excellent development environment .
probably one of your files will likely make an error in the Tag@@ li@@ b library for days . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b @-@ developers under bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org and impos@@ e the cap@@ sul@@ ated file that caused the crash . after that , you can delete the file and restore the collection .
mostly we are talking about that day lib when reading the met@@ a @-@ information from this file system . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b @-@ developers under bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database then try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; am@@ arok ; is somewhat more mature .
make sure that all libraries were compiled by &amp; am@@ arok ; used for example &amp; am@@ arok ; with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b , but with GCC 3.@@ 3.x was compiled then this leads to crash when editing the met@@ a @-@ information .
if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d , then de@@ activate autom@@ echanika . if in@@ active for ... in the setting of the sound system , or use at least a value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ side up by e @-@ mail ( the email automatically opens in a crash ) . if it is a frequent crash and send us a good back@@ trace , the error is guaranteed .
this is that many program records data as UTF @-@ 8 in met@@ a @-@ info , but this is not known as Unicode . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The file $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : Mp@@ lib@@ - &gt; new ( $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ) ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &apos; error when writing the tags of $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &apos; Top $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ;
this script uses the Perl module MP3 : : Mp@@ lib . it can be installed with this command : Perl @-@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : Mp@@ lib &apos;
&amp; am@@ arok ; s symbols in the Status Bar / repet@@ ition / dynamic playlist . this is a well @-@ known error in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes you can see the status disabled on grey and half transparent . note that in some cases up to three times may click on a icon until this setting will show their effect .
when you get this error : amar@@ oc@@ app : symbol L@@ ook@@ up error : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ m@@ ap@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then check if am@@ aro@@ K uses the correct Q@@ t library . you can see it with ld@@ d &apos;s amar@@ oc@@ app &apos; _ BAR _ gre@@ p Q@@ T .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any dup@@ lic@@ ating Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ conf so custom@@ ize that am@@ aro@@ K is the right version first .
there are some possibilities . most of the installation problems can be found on the lightest by the help of a experts your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also use help in other users or developers . use the Forum and I@@ RC under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in channel # am@@ arok .
bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for seeking help . please enter there only one error , if you are something on the error of an error in am@@ aro@@ K itself .
after the launch of &amp; am@@ arok , there &apos;s only an empty playlist . how do music come in there ?
that &apos;s simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of playlist .
to keep the surface intu@@ iti@@ vely , the start @-@ down window was converted into the statistics window . you can find it under ex@@ tras Statistics .
the meaning of these symbols are changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are available for the review by users , while the points are calculated automatically .
to evaluate pieces , the evaluation box must be displayed in the playlist and select column . click anywhere in the new evaluation column to define the evaluation for a piece . you can also use the shor@@ tw@@ ist Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove and then press release on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select from play@@ lists .
draw a playlist file with the mouse to the playlist and let it fall there , exactly how to make it with other files . that &apos;s easy : - )
in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , right next to the Adding button , the button @-@ playlist is located . click on it .
probably we lack the program X@@ M@@ MS @-@ config . install the X@@ M@@ MS @-@ dev@@ el package and install &amp; am@@ arok . new . look for lib@@ visual , this package includes many very nice visu@@ al@@ izations .

V@@ CD@@ Im@@ ager : one of the functional scope fully equipped car system to edit , dis@@ assembling and analyze video CDs and super @-@ video CDs .
standardis@@ alize : this tool is used to match the volume of music files to a standard level . that can be useful for creating a mixed CD &apos;s and Mp3 collections ; without standardis@@ alize , the different recording of the various albums can lead to the un@@ beautiful effect that will be different according to music .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and to playback all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to load recently opened projects . the associated sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry opens the project .
saves the current project . if the project was already stored once , the file will be over@@ written before , otherwise it is asked for a new fil@@ en@@ ame .
saves the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s Dialogue Save below is displayed , with which you can select folder and file file for the project file .
stores all opened projects . this is the same as if you would save up for every single project file .
closes the current project . if a project has changed and not yet saved , ask &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after , what should happen . you can then choose between save and changes . furthermore , you can also break off and open the project as well .
includes all closed projects . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for any un@@ stored project , what should happen , just as would you have called for every project file .
includes all closed projects and finished &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for any stored project , what should be done so as if you had called file shot .
when you call this entry , you can select the same effect as if you draw the files directly from the top view into the Project View . if the current project is a data CD , the added files in the base folder of the CD will appear .
opens the dialogue &quot; Bur@@ n &quot; for the current project . this dialogue is basically the same as the characteristics of the project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; the burning dialog can only open if the project contains already data .
opens the features dialog for the current project . here you can make many projection settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are described ? help ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry only appears with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this is useful if you &apos;re not used for a multiple session CD . the data of the previous session will always be used , even if this function is not used for you , so that you can see the files already existing files and folders .
this entry only appears with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function is set to remove &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; , imported files from the current project . all other files are missing in the project . this function removed no files from the medium , it bl@@ ends only the previously imported files .
opens the CD copying dialog . this allows you to create a copy of a CD on another medium . alternatively , you can also use a copy of a CD which you can then burn sometime later . furthermore , you should also prefer to copy if you want to copy CDs with def@@ ective sectors or video CDs .
opens the DVD copy dialog . this allows you to create a copy of a DVD on another medium . alternatively , you can also use a copy of a DVD with the help of copying @-@ to @-@ copy . furthermore , the target medium will be big enough to capture the entire ( video ) data of the source media in the original form .
opens the dialog for del@@ eting a CD @-@ RW to delete all content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
opens the dialog for form@@ att@@ ing a DVD . with this dialogue , you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) format , making the content completely deleted . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the write modes over@@ write and incre@@ mental .
bur@@ ns a previous CD image . the dialog asks you to be burned down after a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file , which is then not supported by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are not yet supported , but you need to use other tools such as No@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burn a pre @-@ created DVD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o file as data source , which then can be burned immediately by pressing the burning button .
a fully util@@ ised DVD video can be converted . this dialog window appears to be used after reading a DVD in the screen view , but can also be used in use . it contains information about the l@@ ent video , coding settings and even possibilities to change the size and cut black edges .
displays information about the inserted medium . these information will be displayed in the summar@@ ies and include characteristics of the media , such as size and title length of CD or DVD .
shows a list of tool bars of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; when an entry is crossed , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window .
if this is crossed , a small vest at the bottom of the window is indicated . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is hidden .
if the folder view is a or off . the folder view contains an overview of your file and CD / DVD drives . if the content is enabled , their content is displayed in the site screen . CD / DVD drives have also a context menu with functions such as media information , locks and un@@ lock the run or trigger of the medium .
turns the screen view a or off . the site view enables select and pulling files into the projection screen . the site view is also the interface to read from audio or video CDs , if a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view has been selected .
the head til@@ t in the projection is a nar@@ rower range , which contains only visible when the projection will have open projects . the head has no real function , it looks pretty well and separates the proj@@ ections clear from the remaining views .
this will open a dialog for changing the key orders for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after one of the available commands can be selected in the upper part , you can adapt the key assignment below .
this will start the K@@ 3@@ b ; setup assist@@ ants . this allows correct per@@ missions to burn CDs and DVDs . therefore , system administrator privileg@@ es are required , so you must enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) .
opens the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; here you can perform general programming settings . almost all functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; should work on An@@ h@@ ie@@ b . this dialog is intended for Personal@@ ize and for fine tuning the program .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ art ; applications also , with an &amp; D@@ COP ; interface equipped . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a Sh@@ ell@@ script .
to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions , you can either use the command line d@@ co@@ p , or the somewhat more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the functional scope , so rather your taste and the type of your task is crucial , which is the basic programs you den@@ d@@ led .
in this chapter , we assume that you can use the command line d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions you need to make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b is started . then give something like the following on the console :
besides the general &amp; D@@ COP ; functions that have common &amp; k@@ de ; program common , supports &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts , which are described below .
the standard D@@ COP @-@ interface of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; features such as cop@@ y@@ CD , format DVD and further functions for creating new projects .

as a result of such a cre@@ at@@ e@@ XX@@ X Project method you can generate a D@@ COP @-@ reference to the newly created project : # K@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project can be generated using # d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project By using this reference is it possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ ject@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b features the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ ject@@ interface on the top of the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ ject@@ interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Pro@@ ject@@ interface which is only applicable to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :

so it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then add files into the new folder :

&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; is an audio CD ; you can easily read audio CD ; s read and saved in MP@@ 3- or OGG files . also other formats are possible depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( compressed ) . currently , lame are supported for MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs and FLA@@ C ( default free compression ) . additional co@@ als can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the titles of the &amp; CD ; read and then stored in WAV files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these WAV files ( usually one per title ) are compressed into MP@@ 3- or OGG format or in other formats like the los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading &amp; CD ; is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used . almost any distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not installed , this has to be done now .
for the second step , lame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g until ( for OGG ) or other Ko@@ di@@ ers are already installed . however , all these programs are usually being installed for any Linux distri@@ butions . however , only the co@@ stly pack@@ ets must be installed which is used . if FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is not necessary .
what should be used for encoding / file format ? chapter Which codes are a small introduction over Ko@@ di@@ ers , audio quality and compression factors .
a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , uses &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; this program is not possible to read any copy protection . if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device is not possible to avoid any copy protection ; even does not avoid the mechanisms of copy protection . avoid using copy protected audio CD ; s !
while the setup must be performed only once again ( the setup dialog can be called so often ) , the daily handling of a &amp; CD is explained . this leads ( hop@@ efully ) to understand the slim approach of user interface , which you will be proud to be proud in the beginning .
can convert in many formats - depending on which code programs are installed ( MP3 , OGG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can get &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b from the internet or can work completely without a network , whereby all these can be recorded manually .
this is only a short list of commands of the main window . on the page step for example , there are more information about how this program is used as well as pictures of the registration maps for the configuration of the program .
starts the CD@@ DB request of CD data subject to the setup of CD@@ DB . ( this may be locally or online , in the latter case first the connection to the internet is required . )
start reading and - if a encoder is configured in tab code settings in the setup d@@ ino - the coding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available Encoder , so that the selection can be read from any other encoder as the standard . it is to be aware that before the encoder is configured in tab code settings in the setup dialog .
opens the file manager , so you can read and en@@ code a full file instead of a full &amp; CD ; read and read .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of al@@ er@@ ts ( such as protocols , Pi@@ ep@@ tics ) for Program@@ s ( such as read &amp; CD ; finished ) .
opens the main setup dialog of &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; with different cart@@ ons ( such as Encoder , to set the En@@ co@@ ders ) . here you have to go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes clay quality , co@@ aster and compression ratios and helps you to choose the right Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers .
if no audio information is lost , a loss free audio format is needed . in addition to FLA@@ C there are other such as &apos; hormone &apos; or &apos; Monkey &apos; , which may also be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are low compression ratios and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files .
among the audio formats , the information through data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and OGG is the most common . OGG likes today have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit@@ rate , the differences are less important because both co@@ di@@ ers produce very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , lame is still delivered with most distri@@ butions as free , but there are open license questions
+ high to very high sound quality ( at high bit rates ) , but compared to OGG slightly deeper quality when lower bit@@ rates .
OGG - if only music is heard from one computer or a computer @-@ based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG playback devices are present .
MP3 - If music is also heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB Stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special auto @-@ stereo modes . today - initially , these tools usually support both the MP3 format .
a short list with parameters on the audio quality and the compression ratios for &apos; lame &apos; ( MP@@ 3s ) ( see &apos; lame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the most
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer for most people and most music tracks acceptable , and has quite high quality . good enough for stereo audio systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; = 224 up to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and some less for less complex parts of the unit . good enough for stereo audio systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . do always need 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for stereo audio systems with high quality .
&apos; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR joint stereo , compression rate of about 11 . 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a tit@@ els . good com@@ ug to music by adolescents , portable devices and erg@@ oster@@ e@@ o@@ systems . but not good enough for stereo HiFi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting is ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have the absolute highest quality , then choose this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information , manually entered or by the program automatically from the fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; and the code program to create folder and file names as well as the characteristics of the music files .
in connection with coding programs , there is frequently a combination of programming settings for the co@@ als and these parameters . the manual or assistance to Ko@@ di@@ ers explain the switches for these programs .
for example , to add the &amp; CD ; titles to the key@@ word ( English : tag ) if MP@@ 3s must be encoded with lame , the switch @-@ tt of lame and the title parameter is added by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; the result looks like : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; parameters that can be used ( = button @-@ drawing in the assistant ) :
that is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database to read / enter the information can be downloaded / enter , so that all other information can download instead of yourself into the calcul@@ ator . it &apos;s note that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; title , artist , names of pieces &amp; etc ; , not by the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( note : this is the author ) I am not attor@@ ney . however , nobody can choose from the &amp; CD ; more or less valuable , so it can &apos;t be added to the artist nor the music company damage . all information can be saved in a b@@ um@@ mel by a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtu@@ ell .
in &amp; wi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; is active a check box ( sending one address ) . in this type of configuration , it seems that the e @-@ mail address is not used when calling the data from the server ( This can only know the programmer that has checked the code . )
there are in many countries copies of the main database . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; for use of fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographic on next mirror server is needed . this saves bandwidth in the network and resem@@ bles the load between the machines .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ .@@ org provides a current list of refle@@ ctions for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the whole database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
what reading program is used around pieces from the &amp; CD ; stored in WAV files on my computer ?
there is rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used to search in the source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; see note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package from the appropriate distribution must first be installed , if this is not done .
to store the stored WAV files , the Ko@@ cher and so the desired file format is chosen . during the opening time you will find pre@@ defined entries for lame ( MP@@ 3s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( one los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab for setting up the body . other Ko@@ di@@ ers can be added on this tab .
the Ko@@ di@@ erer package must be installed from the appropriate Linux distribution before the co@@ als may be used . for the pre@@ defined co@@ ders , this is also necessary for the pre@@ defined co@@ ders . more information on Ko@@ di@@ erer are in the chapter of the Ko@@ cher .
after installation of a co@@ di@@ ers , more information on his switches can be received by the input of a command such as lame -@@ help or lame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . &apos; lame &apos; will be replaced by the name of the installed Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers .
this may have many causes . check the device of device drawing of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the write and reading of your choice ( lame for MP@@ 3s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) . try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal . that might indicate what is wrong .
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy protected audio CD ; check the shell &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with one step for step example . even if you use other settings , you can give this tips as you need to proceed .
have you read the full manual , everything understood , but somehow still uns@@ af@@ e something to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ step example , and you &apos;ll get enough information to create those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , all in one and our first &amp; CD ; we will be able to use MP@@ 3s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 sample ( tags ) .
you have to be installed c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and lame have already been installed on your computer . both programs should be found as a pre @-@ compiled package for your Linux distribution as it is considered not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files , which you can always do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd insi@@ sts that you own write permission ( eg ; by clicking on the cross @-@ cross section ) .
the first section deals with basic setting of &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; something which is probably done only once and
the second section describes the lecture of a &amp; CD ; which must be repeated for each out &amp; CD ;
here we determine the compression factor for the compression of the music ( lame ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pre@@ set extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 up to 256 k@@ bps ) , where the files are stored and the structure is used to use the program to use the fre@@ ed@@ b to download the &amp; CD ; data from the internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change with any reading &amp; CD ; when once the matching settings are found .
the device name will be delivered to the reading program , so it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
frequently / dev / c@@ drom a symbolic link to the real device @-@ drawing of your drive . if this is not working or if more than a &amp; CD ; / DVD drive can also be accessed . if on the drive with other programs can be accessed , so a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt by using existing entries of the device drawings for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the card ticket General Settings . here is not much to do . here you can define an additional conversion . in our example everything will be shown as shown in the screen photo .
only in case of incomplete information , so you will be informed if data are missing when creating keywords ( tags ) .
the card CD ; -@@ Settings . simply select both entries . we are convenient and allow the &amp; CD ; Download data automatically via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the calcul@@ ator must be connected during the read of the &amp; CD ; it may be connected to the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second selection field is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry is found immediately , if you &apos;re un@@ happy with the database entry and the resulting directory names / file names , or tag entries , you can easily changed . the directory or fil@@ en@@ ame is changed with con@@ qu@@ int@@ - &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , dem &amp; k@@ de ; tag@@ ger .
apart from that example , please note : if you want to enter all manually , then dis@@ able the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b is not used . however , this is worthwhile twice if this is worthwhile . to fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two selection fields must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following card chart .
CD@@ DB is for us fre@@ ed@@ b . these are the information available on the Internet . how white the system , which data can be received from the fre@@ ed@@ b server ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . put everything as shown in screenshot photo .
mode : we did not download the database we want to work with remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ .@@ org and look after a mirror server in your proximity . on this way the load is distributed between the machines . however , this setting will work as first attempt .
both work as equal as the server , as many Fire@@ walls will boot the protocol 88@@ 80 , there may be more lucky with the protocol 80 because it is open &amp; HTTP ; protocol usually open to surf the internet .
in this example , we want to deliver a &amp; CD ; data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server is to dis@@ able the first check box .
simply take the settings from screenshot . ( make sure that the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
number of simultaneously running pieces : sorry , there is a reason why more than one at the time when using existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author doesn &apos;t know , so easy to try .
CD ; after reading the last piece : cross it in order to throw out the &amp; CD ; at the end of the trial .
user @-@ defined file for temporary files : if you are crossed , then the path / folders can be stored in which the WAV files can be saved . if the field is not crossed , the box will not be crossed , if you don &apos;t want to make this folder when you want to make something with the WAV files .
all in such as it is displayed on screen photo . the command is somewhat long , under circumstances you need to see something to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good stereo stereo audio systems . it &apos;s a compression factor is 6.3 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . that reached compression factor 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
notice the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the restriction of the generation of tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can also be deleted as needed . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the names of the procedure ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest as in screen photo . some comments for future use except this sample :
number of simultaneously encoded WAV files : with a Du@@ al@@ core or Quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried to en@@ code more than a WAV file simultaneously .
this is it , we have just finished the basic device of &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; this configuration is used as standard for any reading &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organis@@ ational structure of your music , you never need them to change .
in this section it is described how the process runs out and set up on the hard disk . initially we will build MP3 files . first , a connection to the internet is being built , as we are convenient and the &amp; CD ; the process of which is described in this section must be repeated for any out@@ going &amp; CD ; this section has to be repeated .
since we use a &amp; CD ; you will not see the screen photos a little different from as the for a &amp; CD ; with successfully by fre@@ ed@@ b un@@ claimed data . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data can be manually sent instead of the Internet . comments are displayed on the differences .
don &apos;t try the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this hand@@ book .
if this is not done , then the &amp; CD must now be defined in the drive that has been defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and its length should be listed in the window , such as the screen photo . this only if the &amp; CD ; identified as audio CD ; identified and can be identified by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this is not happening , you are looking for questions or answers after the help or go back to the preceding section regarding the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD can be collected from the fre@@ ed@@ b , all tracks are already completed and in addition , the name of the artist and the album are shown .
in the case there is more than an entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; there will be a window , and you can select the database entry , that fits your opinion on your &amp; CD &apos;s best .
if you do not select the check box for automatic retri@@ eval of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; -@@ settings in dialog for Settings ) , you can also select this manual by choosing the first button in tool@@ bar . if you do not have local database , but need the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet .
E 1.2 Step 02 : CD editor - Input of CD data and Tit@@ els of the first piece
specify the data for your &amp; CD ; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen photo . the title of the piece in the first line of the &apos; ref@@ res@@ eller title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist does not have to be entered in the input field &quot; Update &quot; , unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
the lower comment field can be used for the individual comments ini@@ di@@ ps per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments common to all the pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful retri@@ eve of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b , the CD editor is not empty , but it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor , so that you can not only start with the artist and album names ( e.g. if all words with case letters are beginning or not ... ) , but also to prove if there are any un@@ wanted remarks .
note : in this example , we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ tags : for the artist , album and title of a piece and at only 28 characters for the commentary area . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least to what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; maximum allowed . this option is set up on tab code code settings ; take a look at the &apos; basic settings &apos; .
you can change the tag information of the generated files later anytime with tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files with it , you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags will not be supported by all Ko@@ di@@ ers or file formats . see the help for Ko@@ di@@ ers to get more information .
simply select an entry to coinci@@ de with the style of the issu@@ ing CD ; in this example this is not important because we can &apos;t support the &amp; CD ; data for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ .@@ org and read the information about the categories . pop or R@@ ap for example can be found under Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD @-@ Ed@@ itors appears again and you can see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we need for the first piece . just enter the entries for the current piece . the titles of the piece in any case and other information you wish .
click the next line in the main window and process it down to the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ;
attention : this window will not appear when you downloaded the data from fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album can be displayed on the piece list .
note that there is a check @-@ in before any number of a piece . only the tracks are selected , or simply click on the line switches the selection of the piece , or simply select the button All pieces select at the bottom edge of the screen to select all the pieces at one time .
by clicking on the button selection read the reading process , this window appears to confirmation . click OK and then we will see a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on .
click on the rider orders to switch on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the lower part of the window in the status line .
these error message you see if you are trying to work with a co@@ als you do not have installed . pieces that were not successfully coded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the file for the tmp file and the target folders are not what we have entered in this example . have you checked if you have a write access to the folder for temporary files and target folders ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the reading of the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it &apos;s finished . but we have a new entry : job 4 is the coding of pieces 1 into the format MP3 . so you can read and en@@ code parallel . note the status of the window in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has not found any configuration settings to read and en@@ code the number of parallel processes to read and en@@ code . with powerful machines , the machine with an AM@@ D@@ 64 seems no problem when simultaneously read and en@@ code ( of however two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read , while another piece is encoded , and a third order is encoded in the waiting @-@ long of the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers . after the last piece is coded , a little window will end with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x resp . 4.x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG , you will need the code of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; is currently using CV@@ S as part of the fil@@ ming media package . most distri@@ butions are already a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package is available . if you read this , you have probably done it ...
this section is aimed at persons compiled by source files and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are searching for using the program according to your needs , if it runs once , the following is correct for you :
a program that calls many different programs on settings . best read the step by step example to know the options and settings . it shows screen photos of different card maps of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
hello , still on reading ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked after the first start of the program , without any point out as it is going on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if at the time of program start no audio CD ; on drive ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it ? who reads this , probably already started the program . it should look like this :
one bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author can &apos;t stop this manual . it is the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; intended to do it . at least once after contact with the author . and if you read this , he must leave this section and therefore agree with this suggest@@ ion .
strange if it managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and kar@@ a@@ oke player of &amp; k@@ de ; beside others he did not have real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ a@@ oke @-@ real @-@ sequence of texts also some features , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players don &apos;t have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; supports also the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ asound project drivers , which is required for G@@ US @-@ cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ enz@@ er .
&amp; k@@ mid ; shows the song text on the screen with changing color , so it is easy to follow the piece .
graphic representation of the activity of each MIDI channel separated by high@@ lighting buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can move into &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from one &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window can go on K@@ Mid .
supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( son@@ g@@ ings or text images ) . K@@ mid automatically det@@ ects the process used .
seat support . if you finish &amp; k@@ de ; at the end of playing a song , K@@ Mid starts again next time with the same song .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can open ... from the menu File menu . the usual file dialog appears with which help you select the desired song .
you can also have a file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window will drop . this also works with multiple songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open the button and get the button to play in the tool@@ bar , select the entry to play out of the menu piece or run the empty box .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece will automatically start , as soon as you will drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window will be added to a collection and then play another one after another . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece plays , you can jump on any spot by using the middle mouse button and drive with the kno@@ b and drive .
if you find that a song can be played quickly or too slow , you can click the arrows on the left and right of the template . to get back the original pace , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the Le@@ ert@@ aste has two tasks : if a piece is played , a pressure on the empty @-@ button appears like a pressure on the button break or the select of the menu entry rest in the menu piece , so that playback is played during no piece , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be stored in one piece of music . some pieces use tex@@ tures , other use lyrics and again other both . some pieces have no text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can adjust what events will be presented automatically and even better : the event type will automatically be used , so that you can manually adjust the kar@@ a@@ oke text . however , you still have the opportunity to change this if you want to see the other way .
if you want to set an event type , choose from the menu settings the entries of tex@@ tures or cor@@ set@@ ments . the same function also have the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you can summar@@ ise . these will be used in line with this section as you can use collections .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find in the menu collection under the item .... Click there on New and give the name for the collection .
you can also copy a existing collection by clicking on copying and then add the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs like the original .
if you have more than a collection , you can set the desired categories in the collection manager .
in the temporary collection all songs you want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application , this collection is not stored . consider that if you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , you need to add to the collection manager . there you can add a song using the button . it appears again the file dialog , with which help you select the desired song .
a second method to add a song depends on the setting Automatic add to the collection .
when automatic add to the collection is enabled , a piece when opening ( using file opening or drag &amp; drop ) automatically added to the active collection .
if Automatic is not activated to the collection , when opening a piece , the temporary collection is enabled and re@@ e@@ aled . this collection will then be added to open pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click removing .
you can choose the order that will be played in the songs . if you select the sequence of the menu collections , the songs were played in the order , as they were added to the collection .
if you add songs or remove or random order in the menu , the order is set to be set .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager or use the selection list above the Kara@@ oke text .
to jump a song , select the next song next song from the menu piece or press the button arrow to the right .
to jump back a song back to jump , select the button of previous piece , the entry previous piece from the menu or press the arrow to the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection and click on the button .
temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , that doesn &apos;t matter , since it is not stored when leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; not saved .
this is strictly necessary for syn@@ thes@@ izers , which are not General MIDI @-@ compatible . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI events in events that syn@@ thes@@ ize the syn@@ thesizer .
for example , you can create a MIDI card which converts the patch patch patch to B@@ right piano in events of the change patch patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and thus always enables trumpet to play if originally a piano should play .
if you have only a sound card you do not need MIDI @-@ Map because all the sound cards are GM compatible ( including A@@ we - and G@@ US @-@ cards , FM radio and so on ) .
there are unfortunately no programs to create MIDI maps , so you need to edit the appropriate file from hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that allows all necessary modifications to the playing of a piece .
every section may appear only once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section which may appear as often as desired . however , requires that every occurr@@ ence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
define P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D define the Key@@ map &quot; Name of the Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D define a further Key@@ map ... EN@@ D define ... EN@@ D options ... EN@@ D
you see that define it is necessary to indicate that a section starts ( except for options ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your Map file as an e @-@ mail , so I can support you in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support for devices that are not General @-@ MIDI compatible .
in this section it is indicated like the patches of General MIDI to your specific keyboard . the general use looks as follows :
please note that the left side of the equ@@ il@@ ateral is igno@@ red . it is assumed that the GM @-@ patches must be in the right order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ key@@ s@@ To M is used to lay all sounds which require this instrument to put it on the tone with the number M . if your keyboard is not supported for example ( eg , sound 60 ) , you can add a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which allows the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section :
so now a MIDI file should play a note with patch 127 ( Ge@@ def@@ y ) , it takes Patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of what sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here is meant with the term drum Patch @-@ patch which is meant with each tone a different per@@ perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ary instrument ( drum , bas@@ ins , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one that means the tone the sound height of the always same drum ( like some key@@ boards ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section is used to indicate how sounds are shown on a certain channel or instrument . the use is :
as in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as their presence . you need to create 128 items .
you can define several key@@ maps for each channel and instrument . you only need to use in the first line of different names .
key@@ maps are mainly used to monitor tones on the per@@ us@@ sions channel . check out as an example of the key@@ boards delivered .
this section can be used to form some channels to others . if you want to exchange some channels on others . if you want to exchange the first and second channel , make it simply in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP -@@ section .
however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards which have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI to channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern :
N is the channel that is depicted on the channel N . if you use the key@@ map option to use the key@@ map using the name name for this channel . if you are using the For@@ ce@@ patch option , all events will continue to change the patch on this channel . in this case you will always use Patch x .
the For@@ ce@@ patch option can be useful for example to use the per@@ kus@@ sions patch on the per@@ us@@ sions canal .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ flag ratio can be multiplied , in which ratio Pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event is transmitted using the value n , this is done with the formula n * ( r / 4096 ) and then the value 4096 is used to be used in the map file is no dec@@ imal occurr@@ ence .
this setting is needed because GM is needed that a keyboard , which is to play a pitch benchmark . unfortunately , try some key@@ boards to play two sounds up to one octave . in order to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI @-@ Map , simply open the dialog MIDI settings . you can find in the menu below settings , point MIDI settings
the channel view is a window with a whole number of pi@@ anos ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these connectors you can see which sounds are just played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel , there is a selection list where you have changed a instrument , the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no more the original instrument is used .
the channel view has ( until now ) two different views to display the played tones . view in the Settings menu under the point channel view : settings
the pace LCD shows the speed to be played with which one song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the pace of a couch . if you find , a song be too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the pace , use the arrows left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file containing information about how a piece of music must be played . it contains notes , the rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; so it can result the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways .
good , I can force ni@@ em@@ bo@@ ingen , &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while a mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything .
this may happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; have happened because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support , you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example of k@@ mid ; &apos;s home ) .
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files separately .
agree , it supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder you want to add &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window .
in advance , activate the option Automatic add to the collection . otherwise the files are added to the temporary collection .
you can check the arrow button on the left from Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playing . to restore the standard temp@@ o you can click on the LCD .
I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Desktop a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this mode I must play if the collection is played at the end or I want to play a file , merely go to the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window change and drag the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ;
if you want to listen to a file if you want to add a file without having equal to a collection , turn the option Automatic add to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to temporary collection .
for example , suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ d. one only want to play the first file . so , set the option editing the collection and open A.@@ mi@@ d. your temporary collection then contains exactly these a MIDI file .
then un@@ lock , also B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid can play and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
those people list@@ ened to me MIDI files or postcards . all thank you ! if I see these songs or the postcard , anim@@ ate me that , next to &amp; k@@ mid ; to program me .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Anton@@ i@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ as ; Lag@@ a . at the moment I &apos;m not much free time for my ho@@ b@@ bies , but I &apos;m trying to take a bit of time . as Hob@@ bies I program programming , MIDI files , music and phr@@ ases .
if you want to know where you can download MIDI / kar@@ a@@ oke files if you want a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; have , or even if you simply want to make me happy , write to me a e @-@ mail : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es
you really want to send me a huge anticip@@ ation when you send me a postcard from your residence or a MID@@ I@@ - / kar@@ a@@ oke file from a local group . if you want to send a postcard or a MIDI file , you should get in contact with me when I &apos;ve got a file , since I might have a file .
I have &amp; k@@ mid ; completely renovated in my free time and I would like to emphas@@ ize the money . I therefore want to record it because / if I get feedback from users ( postcards or emails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - Keep the error that the pitch was too high for AW@@ E cards .

in addition , &amp; k@@ mid can also be found on his homepage from ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .@@ html on the homepage you can view the development and look at the links to pages with other kar@@ a@@ oke songs , &amp; etc ;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer because the sound quality depends on your sound card . it is not the same if you use a FM radio or a AW@@ E card .
if you have no sound@@ card you have to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DEM@@ O _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it works as if you had a sound card , besides that you can &apos;t listen to music .
if you are problems , contact the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mail@@ ing@@ lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; k@@ m@@ Player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is used to play video files from the player or phon@@ o supported formats , as well as playback of DVD , VCD or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; on this computer was installed .
for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE website to new releases , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; user mail list .
the application window is made of so @-@ known windows . there is always the window with the central view . alternatively , there is a window with the playlist . and finally , there is an information window that is displayed only when informations are returned .
it is possible to purchase the preferred connections under the menu book@@ marks , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries , you should use the thum@@ b playlist to each other , so you should use the thum@@ b playlist .
of course you can add groups to groups to receive additional hier@@ arch@@ ies . if you copy a entry , his group and all its sub@@ groups to the current category is copied and playback starts with the cli@@ cked record .
the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and continuous playlist , can also be changed if you can only do if &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; not running through the application itself , but also through the application itself . simply click on a name of a category , select from the menu view and as next processing mode . by clicking a sub @-@ group , only the XML content of this particle is shown .
after changing XML files , you must select from the menu to the same playlist and select either the Edit Mode menu or select another category .
all changes are lost when working mode or leave any other group without having left the playlist .
due to the ease of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files ..
the animation and loading can be de@@ activated by editing of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / m@@ play@@ err@@ c and changing &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ ble option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be easily inserted .
it is also possible to activate a different animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; will notice the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / / .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / v@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation at starting does not need to be short , it will automatically end automatically through opening another source . this would be anno@@ ying with the end animation , the user can therefore end the application a second time .
a simple example of an start @-@ animation may be the ad of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; kill ; &amp; lt ; b = / / / home / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; Me@@ et , &quot; ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ ooth@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ ack ; are in the directory tests / some examples of S@@ MIL that are from &amp; k@@ m@@ Player ; are supported .
there is a riders for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ Player ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the intermediate memory size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for trou@@ bl@@ esho@@ oting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of k@@ m@@ player . here the edition of m@@ player is evident here .
there is no rider for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; everything must be configured by manual processing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ w@@ ype . here is an example of how a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ ab @-@ Mozilla is played :
&apos; Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; k@@ m@@ Player ; it can even be inserted the special box em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
in order to playback the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages must play the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module as a service provider for the M@@ ime Type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave flash will be given in the setup dialog file assign@@ ments by K@@ DE .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ Player ; is in a console application to start and after error messages related to the loading of the browser module library . if there is no error , the back@@ end output is within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu to check ) .
so always a pre@@ fabri@@ cated back@@ end is taken for a specific M@@ ime type ( of course only if this is also determined ) , this must be done by manual changing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , phon@@ on all og@@ g files will be used :
&amp; k@@ m@@ Player ; can be used by TV cards , either by using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV , you need to use the device and the TV channels . in addition , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually .
to configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( video data recorder ) settings in the k@@ m@@ player is the dialog for Settings - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there should be ports detected , from which one is selected ( e.g. , it &apos;s PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name has probably contained a DVB input .
since the V@@ DR support of k@@ m@@ player can only work X@@ Video , this type of playing video devices should work under Linux . this is also supported on the first screen ( : 0.0 ) . for the XFree86 server , this is necessary to do the following in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for creating graphical user surface and network support and is required for compilation of &amp; k@@ ile ;
lat@@ ex ; : a professional character application . under Unix good systems probably access the package &amp; tex@@ as ; or &amp; Tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be used in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution . for installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation disc should be used .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; project contains some compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for various distri@@ butions . these enable a simple installation without further comp@@ ile and are contained on the k@@ ile ; -@@ website included .
this manual is suitable for everyone - regardless of the experiences with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ;
advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all proposals are taken into account . is the support for this project or its documentation , the contact information should be made via the k@@ ile ; -@@ website .
apply questions or compilation of &amp; k@@ ile ; on or if extensions are desired , this should be addressed to the ma@@ iling list of k@@ ile @-@ dev@@ el @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; k@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the use of all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ functions in a graphical surface and within this one simple , immediate and customized access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; the possibility to complete , comp@@ iling , editing and trou@@ bl@@ esho@@ oting tools for this . in conclusion , the easy to use and conver@@ gent matters , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ reference and the powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and its possibilities to know , the manual was to be attracted to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can start directly with the editor of &amp; Kate .

there is only a good view to &amp; Lat@@ ex ; given it , it is not the ultimate book . to get &amp; Lat@@ ex ; right for example , H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. Dal@@ y , A Guide to &amp; Lat@@ ex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 d@@ af@@ Ã ¼ r .
just like other recording languages includes &amp; Lat@@ ex ; an introduction to the gener@@ alized features such as paper size , side number@@ ing and text of the text . the introduction contains at least the command \ \ Control class , which begins to be closed with the command \ \ Beg@@ in { command } and must be closed with the command \ \ &apos; .
the entry @-@ level assistant to &amp; k@@ ile ; is a practical function for the fast creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; the selection of the assistant ( Men@@ Ã ¼ ) provides some of the options for the creation of the document . you can also use some of the settings related to the document .
document classes : this will be the type of the document of the document : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , report &#91; Files &#93; , report &#91; Report &#93; , &#93; Report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , projector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , fo@@ ils &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user defined .
coding : hereby the character encoding of the system will be used . modern systems use UTF @-@ 8 encoding than standard . if necessary , UTF @-@ 8x should be used ( for correct processing of &amp; lat@@ ex ; documents ) .
this list contains the most frequently used packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the integration they can be selected only in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , Letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . you should always find use in creating German texts .
new users are now not wor@@ ried anymore . it &apos;s only a brief description of the features and more detailed information will be given in the section .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers - just as other source editors - the high@@ lighting of used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . by &amp; k@@ ile , it is not closed with great probability that any mathematical environment has not been closed . however , it will be saved by the modest appearance of the output file . however , you will be able to save you by a modest appearance .
with the automatic shift in environments , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ Beg@@ in { command } ) of &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically an empty line ( for input of text ) and the add @-@ in line to the correct adjustment of the command ; such function can be de@@ activated in menu setting ; La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled .
all documents are normally divided into several elements . &amp; Lat@@ ex ; ex@@ iting the document of the document in the following elements ( part is the highest and sub@@ jective element ) :
in view of the document at the structure of the structure , the individual elements can be changed through a single click on the respective changed and viewed .
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ files can be very helpful , jumps &amp; k@@ ile ; by clicking with the middle mouse button on the DVI / viewer for the respective line in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code .
a DVI / file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font art and also other information such as the font art of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; there are many tools in view , conversion and printing of DVI ; -@@ files for various systems and devices .
when using the R@@ Ã ¼ r@@ ents , the elements of the DVI / file is cli@@ cked on a element in the DVI ; file , the exact opposite is the exact opposite . as soon as to a section in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code was cli@@ cked , is used for the appropriate place in DVI ; viewer .
Master Document : this function is simplified using multiple files . with a Master document , work is simplified using other embedded .@@ tex files . in the use of a project , a project project can be set up for project settings .
rapid construction : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if no error in the source code ) .
file monitoring : in this mode the DVI ; file is based on the tun@@ nels . - and there is no call from &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the quick construction .
in consideration of the processing tool@@ bar the three large @-@ range selection fields should be developed . the first selection field is designed for fast delivery of document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The available &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands for the classification are :
the selection field is for inser@@ ting articles such as keywords , Fu@@ els , notes , or references . the available are :
designation : using this command , a name for a section , a picture or different element is created .
reference : is used for reference to a specified name ( selection above a selection field ) .
when using quot@@ ation , a selection list with literary entries is displayed . for the processing of &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are appropriate editors . the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; -@@ files can also be written in &amp; k@@ ile ; by hand .
the last selection field with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã ¼ e is used for the definition of the font . it is possible to define the font , which will be specified on the main text , the Fu@@ Ã ¼ ch@@ notes , etc .
when calling &amp; k@@ ile ; two selection criteria are available : 1 . the assistant for the creation of a new document by selecting the document type and celebration of settings . 2 . the document cannot be written with the source .
the brackets for the command \ \ Control class contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; specifies the font . the font is not specified at the beginning , this can also be done in the text .
as soon as the above source text , the &amp; lat@@ ex has to be compiled . the sim@@ pl@@ est way to this is the use of the menu of construction or of the button .
the source must be stored in front of the compilation . &amp; k@@ ile ; for storing the storage automatically .
if you want to document the document , the document should be searched for errors . when using rapid construction , an ey@@ epi@@ ece should be opened ; this is not the case , the protocol should also be considered .
a environment ( English . environment ) is a text that is treated differently than the remaining document . for example , a report with the font is to be created . the command \ \ Beg@@ in { Clean } , \ \ Control and \ \ end { the surrounding of the font is to be added within the surrounding area .
the changes will only be adjusted within the environment ( from \ \ Beg@@ in { 5 } to \ \ An ( environment } ) . there is no exception ( number of cases available within a surrounding area .
there are many advantages for reading the reading and user friendliness of the document . it can be added to such fonts , li@@ ant pressure , cran@@ ial printing , sub@@ missions , etc . these commands are either with the command \ \ or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ Beg@@ in { em@@ ap ) : this command is available for the cur@@ si@@ ary pressure and is long as long until it is closed with a \ \ end { em@@ ph } or another environment . a single word in a sentence can be represented by \ \ em@@ ph { word } .
\ \ Qu@@ ote : created a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ Beg@@ in { Qu@@ ote } and ends with \ \ &apos;s { Qu@@ ote } .
after the background of writing the source text with &amp; lat@@ ex ; lab@@ eling language was shown , now a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; k@@ ile ;
once in the assistant , a little text should be entered , a few adjustments should be accomplished for better read of the document . if a quote , a few points in the fat and cur@@ si@@ veness and a po@@ em is to be used to see the differences of these commands .
as soon as the document was viewed , it can be returned to the editor or Str@@ g E editor ( at the internal viewer ) . at an external viewer the window will be closed .
as soon as the DVI / file created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and fun .
DVI ; is a straight file format ( English . D e V ice I n@@ d ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file converter or computer monitors .
for printing a &amp; DVI file , the same steps as the creation of the document are available ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - then the document can be printed via file printing ( if the printer is set properly ) .
the tool@@ bar uses the conversion of the DVI ; file in other formats . as soon as the DVI ; file from the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; source code was created , the conversion in any other formats can begin by pressing the buttons in the tool@@ bar .
the preview for you to find the direct jump from the editor to the matching position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Bin@@ d files . for this purpose , only Modern under Settings ... Tools needed to be selected .
in order to expand the preview , the mouse poin@@ ter has to be positioned in a line of the source code and close to pre @-@ search . the jump to the corresponding place in the DVI / viewer will then be done .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with one click of the middle mouse button on DVI ; -@@ document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ document by &amp; k@@ ile ; open &amp; k@@ ile ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; available as text editor ( att@@ aching to ey@@ epi@@ ece editor )
in case of quick construction of the &amp; DVI ; slide viewer cannot be found , an error can be found . if an error occurred , this is displayed in the log file or the news window .
the protocol file extends the error source in the source code . in the editor , the log file is always used between the errors . the protocol file is always used to consider the faul@@ ty line has to be cli@@ cked on the error in the journal , navig@@ ating to the def@@ ective line .
as soon as on the button in the tool@@ bar , a window will be available for selecting the template for the document . the default settings are :
with a selection of empty document , a document may be written either from the ground or the assistant to create a new document . further information are included in the section .
users of &amp; Lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction to virtually all documents . templates can be created , stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , you need to create an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file opened or a new file . &amp; k@@ ile ; can create a new template using an existing document and create selection of file template from document ...
when creating a new document , a template may be replaced by other data ( such as name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in settings ... Settings and General settings .
as a result of creating your own template it is necessary to know what strings of which variables are replaced :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ M@@ ENT@@ MAR@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ : this string is replaced by entering in the document class . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ Control Class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ M@@ ENT@@ MAR@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { $ $ &#93; { article } .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to create a template is the use of the assistant and the result of the commands in the editor . as soon as the document created the following steps :
when creating a new document then the own template can be balanced instead of the standard space .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files will be created in a simple way for creating a template , should be searched one on the Internet and the described below described below .
&amp; k@@ ile ; used as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for program@@ mers of reading and high@@ lighting of many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many adjustments for &amp; Kate ; can be placed directly in the menu .
to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and his testimonies are to be attracted to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; you can get there directly to reading the book by &amp; Kate .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command re@@ fer@@ encing that can be called over the menu of the La@@ Te@@ X reference . you will find out a detailed description of all commands that are found in &amp; Lat@@ ex ; use as well as their syntax .
double click on the \ \ par of \ \ par \ \ certified ski@@ p , click on this way when clicking on \ \ par of \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p .
when pulling the text with straight lin@@ ker mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with different sizes , can be selected parts of the source window in the editorial window .
&amp; k@@ ile ; has the possibility to browse the most diverse types of source tex@@ tures and these . for example , the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; commands from normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ulas can be highlighted by another color .
many assist@@ ants can be found in the field of origin . these jumps is highlighted by an own kind of book@@ marks within the text . the jumps stamp or the corresponding key figure will be highlighted the jump to the next or last j@@ umping mark . this will also be highlighted the jump in the first input of a character .
the processing is probably one of the main aspects of using a program such as &amp; k@@ ile ; although &amp; Kate ; already outstanding features were added ; &amp; Lat@@ ex ; available always many environments and groups and therefore support different commands for their selection . under processing conditions , the following commands are contained in the text selection :
if you have a complete paragraph ( a group of lines containing on both sides a blank line ) . this extended significance was added to the tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source text . the only be@@ u@@ clear@@ er thing in &amp; k@@ ile ; is that the upward trend is separated by two empty lines .
if the word is below the current cur@@ sor position . this selection also has an advanced meaning because this command is also &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands with a separate star ( * ) at the end .
to protect the document this document can be removed and by pressing the button C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the whole line is removed . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers with own commands for a faster result . under processing , the following commands are contained in the text of the text :
remov@@ es a complete paragraph . the definition for a sub@@ section in &amp; k@@ ile ; is contained in the description on processing weather conditions .
it has already been clear that environments offers a central role in &amp; Lat@@ ex ; therefore offers &amp; k@@ ile ; for further orders of machining environment for a m@@ Ã ¼ Simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
with this command is spra@@ yed at the beginning of current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the surrounding area .
with this command is spra@@ yed at the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to close the surroundings .
when the cur@@ sor is before or within the \ \ Beg@@ in command ( or vice versa ) it will be held at the end of its surroundings ( or vice versa ) .
when the input of many f@@ aded environmental command can be lost quickly , the surrounding area can be lost . this command closed the most recently surrounding area , so the un@@ locked environment has not been carried out .
&amp; k@@ ile ; also special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups which are determined by stap@@ les { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group there are some important commands that meet the processing environment .
with this command , the command will be spra@@ yed at the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the welded cl@@ amps .
with this command , the command will be spra@@ yed at the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the closed cl@@ amps .
when the cur@@ sor is before or behind the welded cl@@ amps of a &amp; tex ; -@@ Group # is , to the other end of the group spec@@ tions ( or vice versa ) .
when the input of many welded groups can be lost quickly , the surrounding groups can be lost quickly . this command is closed , so the f@@ ax@@ ed structure of the &amp; tex ; -@@ Group is not dist@@ orted .
in &amp; Lat@@ ex ; two simple resist@@ ors are used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the sign &quot; for this purpose is used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the sign &quot; for two simple beginnings is used . &quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; knows this case and controls two close trials for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one .
this automatic set of double shape can be set up under att@@ itudes ... La@@ Te@@ X and turn off .
it is also possible to specify a specific settings ( e.g. no@@ d or French ) , and that German or French forms are used . there are also many other languages available .
when pressing Shift ; recept@@ acles available &amp; k@@ ile ; an intelligent line breaks . if the current position is within a lists -@@ environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , it is not only a line breaks but the command \ \ item at the same time .
close to a Tab@@ les -@@ environment close &amp; k@@ ile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ \ with an enclosed line breaks off .
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom environments . this enables you to put them under settings .
some user interfaces the columns in Tab@@ les -@@ environments and thereby all E@@ t @-@ characters ( amp ; ) ; seeks to ex@@ h@@ ort . if this tab is not possible , for the next tab . although this tab is not possible to add &amp; k@@ ile ; some inter@@ spaces for the columns are added to the current table .
although &amp; Kate ; already offers good source text content , this in &amp; k@@ ile ; in order to include special commands ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) . these modes are available for automatic transfer . all these modes can be set to different work under settings .
in the beginning a new environment by the command \ \ Beg@@ in { area } will be added &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically the command \ \ end { environment } after an empty line ( for the text ) added .
when pressing the ring button , the last letter of the input is removed and you can gra@@ b the complete list . on the other hand , the list can be reduced to further letters by entering a further letters .
all commands are written with a short description of its parameters . alternatively , you &apos;ll be locked in selecting a command . alternatively , this will be m@@ apped to these positions by editing the hall@@ marks N@@ Ã ¤ j@@ umping diving brand , and the desired parameters will be locked .
under att@@ itudes ; stir ... k@@ ile ; full settings can be made to these lists . you can share different w@@ ells for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands as well as winding of the general language used .
the command mode is not sufficient for the distribution of environments where you will always have a few letters with \ \ Beg@@ in and will be used a large @-@ scale list with ambient conditions . on the other hand , the environments will be used as often , that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for distribut@@ ing environments will be used .
when calling the menu button , the order is automatically locked in the surrounding area or the key element Alt + Shift button . afterwards the environment is continued into the sim@@ pl@@ est way and the environment can be continued in the sim@@ pl@@ est way and can be stopped by pressing the input .
after this is completed , the environment will be closed automatically . once &amp; k@@ ile ; det@@ ects that it is a first \ \ item -@@ command with incoming orders .
under att@@ itudes ; stir ... k@@ ile ; fully compatible settings to these lists . this mode uses the back@@ list of reference mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands .

PS files are not known as PDF files , but we offer an outstanding basis for changes and new orders of pages . the PDF issue will be displayed with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools newly built and then converted to a PDF file with p@@ s@@ 2@@ pdf .
to give the result of the work , it needs to be compiled . all tools are group@@ ed into the menu of creating comp@@ iling , creating converting and creating view .
for the compilation of the source code for viewing as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used with Alt ; 3 , using Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file into a PS file converted and using Alt ; 5 the PS file can be viewed .
when using the command quick construction , a viewer will normally be called upon the compilation . if no built @-@ in viewer should be used , every time a new window will be opened .
a new project will be presented to the project .... Hier@@ in will be asked for the following information :

it is not only about a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather it is a fully integrated instruction manual for the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; it is thus ideal for searching for a specific form@@ att@@ ing . since it is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; k@@ ile ; in three important wire .
due to the amount of documents with those &amp; Tet@@ ex ; / ex@@ live ; delivered , the final document is not always easy . as possible help , &amp; Tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ as ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all about &amp; k@@ ile ; delivered documents and for a graphical surface area .
all documents are divided into categories and the gra@@ zing advantage is the search for par@@ cel or stroke . by &amp; k@@ ile ; then only the results are displayed .

the version 3.2 of &amp; Pro@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration into &amp; quantitative ; all these tools use comp@@ iling as surface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as base . the combination makes fast , efficient , complete and productive tools .
everyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has thought @-@ pro@@ c and how superior it is . if we offer it a piece of a graphical surface ! not more on a terminal ; just click the icon for the XML processor and finished !
this application expects a inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is located in the w@@ ron@@ eous working folder , then you can remove the current working folder . if not , then remove the selection of current work@@ folders and enter the desired folders in the field of other folders .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files are deleted each time if my pro@@ c is started .
as already said , everyone who has worked on &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has already worked , knows how helpful this application . and with &amp; quantitative information , there is now a great graphical surface for it .
if the just open file inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is then simply select the current work@@ folder . if not , then select the current working folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is available .
when it comes to an output on the screen , your file is incorrect . please check the reported mist@@ akes and try it again .

if this file is to be processed in &amp; quantitative ; it is already selected , then let it simply select the current file . if not , remove the actual file and select it to a processed file using the other file file selection .
specify the name of file as the result is to have . the file normally is stored in their home folder .
the plug @-@ plug@@ ins , the &amp; con@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even may not do little . as a result , you can benefit from the additional functionality and must not wait until som@@ eb@@ ody builds up the desired in &amp; quantitative ; the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements can also be used below .
to install a plug @-@ in or a K@@ part , we begin with the plug@@ ins editing . thus the following dialog will be opened :
this dialog allows to manage all included plug@@ ins and added new plug @-@ ins . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ element in it :
here you can enter the search path when adding plug@@ ins without an storage place &amp; quantitative ; this path for the search of plug@@ ins .
often working on a project several people work in a sort of hier@@ arch@@ ical relationship . &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the indication of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties Project Properties .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the top name of the user and serves for unique identification .
one member may have several roles in the project , such as both team manager and a Sub@@ project leader .
the user can choose from the list of team members who he is . this happens by putting the team member from the list and ex@@ presses the button . currently selected member ( its identification ) will appear fat after you are : text .
top name and setting up its own identity are important for news and remarks . see for further information about ann@@ ot@@ ations .
in addition to the overview of her team , there is another advantage through the acquisition of members of the team : it can be created an event about the Team Leader if something specific is happening . see for further information .
event actions are actions which are executed if something specific in the project is happening , such as much someone has worked , or the sending of a message when a file is secured , or a script that plays a file into CV@@ S once you will be added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the page event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project settings dialog can be created , processed and deleted .
an email will be sent to the address data selected in the receiver list . address can be a team or sub @-@ project leader . see in , we@@ i such ladder can be set up .
remarks are special comments in documents . they differ from normal reviews by the following things :
note : it can be either chosen from the editor @-@ context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key@@ word in a commentary sector followed by a notice text .
remarks can be sent to a certain member of the team . in this case , the syntax of the team member states or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) is a role in the project consisting of the following possibilities : team manager executive manager Sub@@ project leaders , according to the field and sub@@ project managers , should be given the corresponding range or sub@@ project names , as shown in the examples below .
nick@@ names and roles names are independent of large or small parts , but spaces around the brackets and the : make the note inv@@ alid .
&amp; Pro@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for script and form@@ att@@ ing languages , the DT@@ D ag@@ ag@@ nost@@ ic is and web @-@ based form@@ att@@ ing and script languages supported .
the settings can be reached via the Settings menu . here only about &amp; quantitative ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a brief description for the others can be found in .
the settings can be called Qu@@ anta ... called . this dialog extends over some pages that will be treated with each other .
the behaviour of &amp; quantitative ; regarding tags including car may be modified . the entries are :
large / Classi@@ fication of tags : large / Classi@@ fication of tags : large / Classi@@ fication means that tags will be added , as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
large / Classi@@ fication of At@@ tri@@ butions : large / Classi@@ fication of automatically added At@@ tri@@ butions . normal Groß / Classi@@ fication means the attributes are added , as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional tags include : if any act , is optional for tags that is optional for the closing day , this immediately after the &amp; gt ; inserted .
not optional tags : as above all other tags except for easy tags .
automatically update the start and end day : if switched on , the corresponding day will be changed and vice versa .
automatic detection of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acute characters in the corresponding encoding during the type .
M@@ ime types : Mim@@ et@@ types for detection of different types of files . using the button standard , the default values can be recovered .
standard character encoding : the coding of newly created or in other ways as with file opened open files ( where the coding of the file can be addressed ) , but this setting will be em@@ itted by the same in the project features , if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not recognized . however , this setting will be out@@ bound by the same in the project features , if a project is loaded .
create a backup copy : &amp; quantitative backup ; creates regularly backup , so that in case of a power failure or crash at the next start of the program , this is not the same as saving the file . even for not stored documents the backup is regularly created , according to the set time created .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editorial area or its own view ( or documentation in a carton re@@ iter ) what makes it possible to preview the documentation and documentation at the same time .
set the window settings on the standard back to the next start is useful if the user interface are caused by changing the MDI modes and and@@ o@@ cken / depend on belie@@ fs each . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters .
the warning messages refers to the tax of the possibility to rev@@ ise the display of war@@ nings by an@@ h@@ ack from non more questions .
the place to change the behaviour of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can also change the display of symbols instead of scripts like the synchron@@ ization of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source code in divided mode . as regards the different modes see .
the Par@@ ser and the Stru@@ c@@ row can be found here , representing the illustration of the Par@@ ser no@@ des in the document , in detail .
in the field of mouse click on the structural tree , the following action is possible to change by clicking the structure sub@@ tle with the mouse button .
in the Range of Stru@@ c@@ els Settings , the Vis@@ ibility of no@@ des in tree , can be opened automatically at a modification of the structure tree automatically . empty no@@ des are the empty sections in the text , while empty groups such as are found in the current document no element .
the area for fixed ab@@ brevi@@ ations ( a type of templates ) , which are un@@ locked to extensive text . ab@@ brevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each may be valid for multiple &amp; DT@@ EP ; this means it can give a valid group for PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ - ab@@ brevi@@ ation is something different means than in a group valid for Javascript .
here the plug @-@ ins can be managed . plug @-@ ins are part of the third page that can be re@@ used by any part @-@ enabled application , most well @-@ known &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ ins , the following must be :
address : the path to plug@@ in if there is not at a standard location like $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / lib .
input : this information is presented to the plug@@ in when you start , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of current file ) or the project folder .
note in &quot; Only @-@ read &quot; mode : check if the plug@@ in is denied the load . only @-@ read @-@ parts refuse to loading the load when this option is not chosen .
check the plug@@ in : is this activated , then test@@ et &amp; quantitative ; if the entered information is correct . if the plug@@ in is not available , but if the plug@@ in at the moment is not available , but it will be installed later .
for &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; from version 3.3 , trou@@ bl@@ esho@@ oting has been completely redesigned . the support for the non @-@ built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger was discontinued , as also the support for the D@@ BG Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead of it was implemented a deb@@ ug@@ ger plug@@ in concept that allows different implem@@ ent@@ ations over plug@@ ins .
currently only a plug@@ in is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; in@@ placement .
the use of the deb@@ ug@@ ger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable deb@@ ug@@ ger plug in the project settings . using the button options in addition to the deb@@ ug@@ ger plug@@ in selection field , the specific settings can be changed .
if a deb@@ ug@@ ger is enabled , some additional elements appear in the &amp; quantitative ; interface :
a view that displays the content of monitored variables is normally displayed in the left dock .
a view in which all holding points , with line numbers and conditions are listed , usually in the lower dock .
a view that shows the output ( like in HTML ) of the deb@@ ug@@ gers . usually appear in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of de@@ bug , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this promotion , the connection is made for deb@@ ug@@ ger , if necessary , or it divi@@ des the plug@@ in with , on deb@@ ug@@ ging requirements . this promotion is opened as default if a de@@ bug is used , so that a deb@@ ug@@ ger must not be counted .
the counter@@ part to Deb@@ ug@@ ging session Star@@ te session . closes the connection to Deb@@ ug@@ ger or termin@@ ate the harp after requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to initi@@ ate a de@@ bug request . this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document . the edition of this requirement is displayed in the Deb@@ ug@@ ger issue .
shows the deb@@ ug@@ ger to begin with the execution of the script and information on the supervised variables as well as the currently working line , the execution continued during the script will be continued . if a deb@@ ug@@ ging is started , the script will start with the request .
shows the deb@@ ug@@ ger to begin with the execution of scripts , without information to over@@ watch variables and the current line number . if this happens , whilst a script will continue , the execution will start before a deb@@ ug@@ ging request begins , as soon as a requirement is made .
the deb@@ ug@@ ger performs the next statement in the script without entering the functions or include files .
the deb@@ ug@@ ger performs the next statement in the script , whereby it is possible to check in functions and include without any error .
points the deb@@ ug@@ ger to go to the command and go to the next way , than wouldn &apos;t be the current .
opens a dialog in which a variable or an expression can be monitored , which should be monitored . the exc@@ essive value appears in the variable view .
this dialog can be entered a variable , or a new value of a variable .

this chapter describes how you can custom@@ ize &amp; quantitative ; to your needs , and how to get &amp; quantitative ; help to become better .
document type E@@ edit packages ( DT@@ EP ; s ) are used in &amp; quantitative ; to give support for mark@@ up@@ and scripts . your simp@@ licity and flexibility makes out &amp; quantitative ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; DT@@ EP ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages or &amp; CSS ; . day folder contain two file types , the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and Tag@@ XML files with the ending .@@ tag@@ . tool@@ bars are hand @-@ oriented , symbol@@ ise l@@ aces of image buttons ( above the editing window ) , the text and instructions faster than one user could be .
&amp; DT@@ EP ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see for details of converting .
this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . short , one &amp; DT@@ EP ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the Fe@@ at@@ u@@ res@@ dial@@ og@@ es , the &amp; quantitative information ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; DT@@ EP ; even . tool@@ bars provide a fast insertion of tags in a document without any risk of any problem .
tag folder are nothing as folder . they contain only the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the day XML @-@ files . tag folder bear the name of the text @-@ language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.0@@ 1 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML on and declare whether they are necessary , or not . although not all are necessary , it is advis@@ able to use as many as possible , so many users have a better viewing and more information when working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits are explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of an Tag@@ XML document . it can only contain once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains only element type itself , otherwise nothing else .
the tags is a script function . when using it &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( family 2 only )
valid only for Tag@@ typ class . the name of the basic class for this class . ( family 2 only )
only for the type Method applies . returns the name of the class where this method belongs to . ( family 2 only )
if yes , the day has a common attributes group and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( family 1 )
assumes a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; -@@ day . this is an only element type element .
describes a attri@@ bute of a tags . this element can only be found once for each attri@@ bute . additionally , it lays the name and the type of attributes . additionally , it contains additional tags that will be displayed as this attri@@ bute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is an only element type element .
returns the source code used for the attributes in the tag editor dialog and the attri@@ bute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; quantitative ; is used to reach the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p @-@ method@@ name within &amp; quantitative information is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a cutting and one method@@ ology name . the arguments that will be delivered to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tags .
a container day that group@@ ed together into a list . it can only occur in a attri@@ bute description only once . it is an only element type element .
if the position of the attri@@ bute is fixed within a dialog box . this day can occur only once for each attri@@ bute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the element is empty .
returns the position and size of a field in the dialog . this day should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Day ) . this element is empty .
there is a list of elements that may occur within the specified tags : this element is an only element type .
there is a list of elements that end a day . this element is an only element type .
all Tag@@ XML files need to begin with an &amp; XML ; -@@ Dec@@ i@@ ation begin : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = 1.0 @-@ 8 ? &gt; and have to be glu@@ ed and closed .
spaces influence nothing but keep on &amp; and &amp; lt ; sign . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will be replaced , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is available in &amp; quantitative window ; -@@ window to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . to choose . another dialog will appear to follow the simple instructions .
this function is currently not available yet . at the moment the verification of the Tag@@ XML files are at &amp; con@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
in the following an example of a family 1 day XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; Element from the &amp; W@@ 3C ; &amp; XML ; -@@ sch@@ ema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this day XML file should be schem@@ atic .
in the following an example of a working family 2 day XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP file will be described . the file name of this day XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; lt ; ? XML &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; encoding = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ; tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over@@ load &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; function = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; function = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; = &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just fairly simple and there is a editor that can be processed via DT@@ D edit DT@@ D settings . by editing an &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; for a newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; a simple &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; should be created with the following entries :
&#91; General &#93; version = use 1 for &amp; quantitative ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D indication . ( / / W@@ 3C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional / / EN ) N@@ ick@@ name = The simplified name of the DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
a action can be set up with settings .. Click on New action leads to the same dialogue :
this promotion is assigned a key root . with clicking on the User button , a key root can be assigned ; with K@@ one , the current key root can be taken away .
the easiest actions . it can be entered into the detail settings and inserted in the execution of the promotion , this text is inserted at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . using the help of this promotion , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) , which will change or use as input ( or parts of the document ) , the quick start @-@ up dialog or the various refer to ... promotions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ EPs .
as first , the name of script and interpre@@ ter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scri@@ pt@@ .@@ sh .
although qualified paths are permitted , it is recommended to use the % scri@@ pt@@ iles variable in the command line ; the script tries to find the script : global script file : $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / quantitative in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we replaced with the URL of the current documentation . in case of local document , file is removed : / from the document name .
% pi@@ d : will be replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; quantitative ; only one instance will exp@@ ire . this is useful if D@@ COP is used to control the P@@ ID number ; this is useful if you use D@@ COP to control &amp; quantitative ; the external script will be used .
the parameters for this event normally , usually the file name of the current document or path to the project file .
in addition to the above methods , a script can accept a script from &amp; quantitative ; at the default input . in the input field input can be determined , which is to be sent to the default value . possibilities are :
for selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is normally meaning@@ ful only with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the issued application can also be re@@ directed . there are two kinds of output : normal output written to the default error edition . it can be specified , which should be done with the default output written by the default output text :
if there are lots of tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create a tool@@ bar for each group . in given cases it is not too many , so you can create a tool bar using the name of the mark@@ ups .
as soon as a tool bar is added , you must add your actions and configure the settings .
the parts of this window are fairly self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Aktion Kn@@ op@@ sis at the bottom end of the window kicks off the editing mode .
fill out all the required fields and add them to the appropriate tool@@ bar to the corresponding tool@@ bar .
complete all and , if the Tag attributes has and you are planning to call the &quot; Tag &quot; day when available , so that an input when using the action is possible .
Ig@@ itt ! is this a ug@@ ly icon . who should notice the action in connection with this symbol ? replace it before we have difficulty .
for creating a symbol that the action is better , we will use &amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; use the &amp; k@@ menu ; , graphics other programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; used as default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size .
please note that the created symbol does not only help you understand what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; DT@@ EP ; .
with regard to that the day of start , I decided to create a start button as icon . by using green ( green becomes less , rigid , further interpreted ) , or should be sign@@ alized a message to the user that clicking on this symbol is a &amp; lt ; Start@@ ed on ; -@@ day in the current document .
after creating the symbol , it is still to be connected to the action . this happens over the menu with Settings promotions ... ( in &amp; quantitative ; ) and selection of the required action . in addition to the text box is a button , press it .
select the folder where the stored icon is located , select it and confirm you with OK .
press the user button and continue with other tags , so it is that there or confirm you to complete with OK .
suppose you want to complement some usual &amp; quantitative ; functions for tool@@ bar , or it should be divided for a better overview through some separ@@ ators in several groups . set the tool@@ bar set on settings tool@@ bars . make sure the required tool@@ bar is selected .
I want to select the separ@@ ator ( on the left above ) for my tool bar . after the selection of the element that can be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow button to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar .
for example , I would like to add a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I &apos;ll select it and add to the tool@@ bar .
please note how the Tren@@ to support the group . someone who does not know my tool bar could believe that the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by try all symbols to ensure that everything works .
back in the correct folder . after re@@ e@@ XML not exists , it is put in the correct folder , but your tool bar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . please adjust your &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that their tool bar ( s ) is loaded , if a file is opened from the appropriate type .
perhaps the chosen expansion of &amp; quantitative expansion ; for the normal user is the option to add documentation for the script language or the form@@ att@@ ing language you like to like . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; document tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you may check in &amp; quantitative ; - Rep@@ os@@ itory , if anyone has done this for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you have to search an existing documentation for the form@@ att@@ ing / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . then we need to leave the do@@ cr@@ c file . let us make the second part we cover here .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c You = path , relative to this file , for example php@@ 42 / # elements in the main index top element = your description for these docum@@ ent@@ ations e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 Section Section 1 = page 1.@@ html Section 2 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 1.@@ html
the section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , look at the &amp; PHP ; documentation as something :
# K@@ DE config file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c You = php@@ 42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 version = Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x@@ .@@ html Get@@ ting Start@@ ed = Guide , ... introduction = Sec@@ tion@@ .@@ html ... Language Reference = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = B@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ taxes ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . that shows that there is sub @-@ file in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the box office ( except through the understanding ) m@@ d@@ ash , but try it out .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consistent , at the top end of the building life &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; file is displayed ! ) .
spaces influence nothing but keep on &amp; and &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; quantitative ; res@@ our@@ c@@ end@@ at@@ ry will be replaced .
the section of this section is the range of do@@ cr@@ c file , which is used to display the context of text and pressing C@@ tr@@ l _ array function . by selecting the function called and pressures of C@@ tr@@ l ; H for context aid would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file connectors .
a simple list of separated separate context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c easily and from $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / quantitative / apps for local or global use . then create a folder ( as you have given this in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation .
if you are certain that this well and it is worth , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. what documentation were used to use &amp; quantitative ; - Community . you will not be rich , but proud to be proud to have worked on the best web development platform .
with &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us , you are not alone . it is possible to divide resources ( DT@@ EP packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or otherwise to whom will send an Email menu , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( DT@@ EP ) with email , send tool@@ bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders inside the templates and scripts .
the resources can be up@@ loaded into our main archive , from where all other &amp; quantitative information can be downloaded and only available when our team needs them as correct and use@@ full for the publication . for a use@@ full contribution we recommend to use the resources for our team as well as for the later users .
when up@@ loading , you are asked for their private G@@ PG key ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase will not be saved ) , or in the case that you have several key to enter the input fields ( URL preview can remain empty ) and with clicking OK the up@@ loading is started .
up@@ loading can also be up@@ loaded from the menus DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( DT@@ EP ) , tool@@ bar tool@@ bar , and in context menu of files and folders inside the templates and scripts tree .
after downloading a resource , even before installation , exam@@ ines &amp; quantitative assessment of the resource by exam@@ ining the integrity and Sig@@ ni@@ fication . in the case of problems it war@@ ns and it may be canc@@ eled . if the integrity and the resource is signed , a message appears with the inscription of the owner of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML languages , which is currently not yet supported by &amp; quantitative package , but creating a DT@@ EP package . however , the preparation can be needed temporarily , because hundreds of day files could be necessary in tag@@ XML format . there is the simpler way to allow DT@@ D automatically into an DT@@ EP package .
the conversion can be started from the menu DT@@ D load and converting an DT@@ D . select the .@@ d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description which should be used . afterwards the following dialog appears :
target name : the newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / quantitative / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! DO@@ C@@ TY@@ PE Defin@@ itions : the string , which is shown in the DO@@ C@@ TY@@ PE day , such as HTML PU@@ BL@@ IC - / / W@@ 3C / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ m@@ l@@ 4 / ht@@ m@@ l@@ 4 / Not@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d
fine adjustment of the DT@@ EP after conversion : if enabled , brings &amp; quantitative ; according to the conversion and descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; Editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; Pro@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there are some key concepts . to understand this and full advantage of &amp; quantitative concepts . this chapter must first be entrusted with these fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to bring them exactly these concepts without their understanding &amp; quantitative ; little use .
in &amp; Pro@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the work@@ space is divided into three areas : global , locally and projection . this differentiation is concerned with a number of components in &amp; quantitative ; .
global elements are available for each , the &amp; con@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; it uses , available . from tool@@ bars over actions , everything is marked as globally , in the joint size structure of &amp; quantitative information ; this enables the group of administrators different tool@@ bars , actions and patterns available in the global tree , which will be available to each in a multi @-@ user environment at the system .
local elements provide a personal collection of web development for a single user . these are custom patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can use only this user personally .
proj@@ ections are only available within a specific project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; - patterns can be used specifically for the files of a specific project . simply said , this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder &apos;s folder of speci@@ alities and designs from all employees within the project .
the &amp; quantitative ; -@@ MDI ; consists of several principal areas : the Edit@@ or@@ window , the building views , the boxes with information and tool@@ bars . please propose in , and for further information about these areas .
you can click on the right mouse button to receive a context menu with the current documentation in order to re@@ charge , delete or upload the document , jump or upload the document , jump to an book@@ marks or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document .
right in the editorial area , lead to another context menu regarding the revised documentation , such as basic processing steps ( cut / copy / paste ) , processing of under the mouse poin@@ ter , or open the file , if the strings can be called a file under the mouse poin@@ ter .
at the top end of the editor are the tool@@ bars of the Ed@@ itors . currently absor@@ bs &amp; quantitative ; 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional has been shown as standard , for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; quantitative information , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and therefore connected user needs .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a single day , e.g. &amp; lt ; in their document , then click the icon to insert the day . now , you can insert the data for this straight day . if you want to insert a day that has several attributes ( such as anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog for different fields .
the construction views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow it to navigate to the information &amp; quantitative information ; in representation with cart@@ ograph@@ ers are available for files , project , sample templates , documentation structure , scripts , attributes and documentation .
project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; quantitative information . this view shows all the files in the project and allows you to manage all files in the project using right mouse click . actions like adding , removing , up@@ loading or delete files from the storage medium can be performed with the displayed context menu .
another possibility of templates &amp; quantitative ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc ; It is possible to show you all options .
templates can be divided into three categories , depending on which they are used . the category depends on &amp; quantitative information . global templates are always available , local templates for users and templates are available in the project . more on templates are available .
here you can find information on the available scripts . the concept of re@@ integration in Global , Lok@@ al and Project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button you can call the available information to a script . about the right mouse button are available , such as the script to run , edit or send to email .
with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . through left @-@ click of an element , the cur@@ sor is set to the position of the element . by right click of an element opens a list of commands to navigation and collection of the tree .
this tree appears below the other architectural perspectives . it allows you to change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . this enables all the attributes of all available attributes with a few clicks .
here is the complete documentation on web technology for your development . there may be pre@@ packaged documentation for &amp; quantitative ; the documentation site can be downloaded , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be selected , edit and viewed .
by default , &amp; con@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two cart@@ ei@@ vers at the bottom end of the window , can be reached via the useful information : the news window and the problem window .
this cart@@ ograph@@ er shows information about each in Qu@@ anta running script . for example , the DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to the DT@@ D are displayed .
this cart@@ ograph@@ er shows all error in the mark@@ up of current documentation . &amp; quantitative information , scripts that are carried out , give all error messages ( as it is ) in this window .
the &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the appropriate command . the chocolate page is the possibility to define own commands as symbols in &amp; quantitative ;
another function of &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar to your mail . &amp; using a tool bar via e @-@ mail ; if you receive a tool@@ bar in an email , you can secure them in &amp; quantitative ; such as any other secure and load !
it is reasonable if you want to custom@@ ize the location of &amp; quantitative information . for this , auto@@ conf has access a number of options that can be delivered to the Web script . to get a complete list of all options , type / configure . the options are simple to understand and not run here .
if you have problems with start &amp; quantitative ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 am file . also you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the P@@ AT@@ H in front of their bin folders . same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; Pro@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE @-@ surface . &amp; Pro@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; has been optimized for rapid Web development and combines a mature development environment with a wide range of powerful features .
during work , the best &amp; HTML ; editor began to create , the developers of &amp; quantitative idea began to deal with a obvious , extended mark@@ up languages editor now ? well , this would be the absolutely great Web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer on pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; quantitative ; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then it should be &amp; quantitative ; therefore , the appropriate &amp; IDE ;
well , to the above mentioned limit must be noted that &amp; quantitative information is based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; the development of Why are someone else developed ? thanks to &amp; k@@ de ; report is not only possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; quantitative ; so to expand how it need it for their need .
&amp; Pro@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; enables web developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( MDI ; ) . this can expand productivity almost every task . by the program compression , they can find &amp; con@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you can also need to remember a script of script . ( more about it is found in . )
&amp; quantitative ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and has been developed quickly to a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; quantitative ; Plus is connected in any way with commercial versions of &amp; quantitative ; the original developers left the GPL @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more in the details of the documentation is provided with help : / quantitative ( either this URL in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; enter or help help : / quantitative ) .
&amp; quantitative ; is currently developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ an@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time when you open a file , which is not taken out when the oldest entry is taken out .
that allows you to save the code parts and complete files as templates for the later use . check in the Section on templates . should you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project management tool , only a mistake will be reported .
convert from the clip@@ board there contained special characters to &amp; HTML ; Write , making it correct and not be understood from the browser as form@@ att@@ aching .
convert the text from the clip@@ board in &amp; URL ; -@@ Write , which is the correct way to add special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . first line to add &amp; URL ; s into the anch@@ ors day .
switch the block selection or out . it allows you to select text blocks with the help of the &amp; Shift ; select it .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; script error messages can be found !
sear@@ ches for a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or SE@@ D with GUI and pre@@ defined expres@@ sions to help you .
shows the news window , or not at . that is the window where you can see the display of scripts and deb@@ ug@@ ger .
delivery and Swit@@ ching of the problem re@@ por@@ ters at the bottom edge of the &amp; quantitative ; main window . the problem re@@ porter is activated , once you change to the structure tree .
shows the symbolic content of the main window . this column allows you to set up with a mouse click .
when there are book@@ marks in the current file , you will be appearing in the menu together with the entries previous or next chapter , depending on the position of cur@@ sor in the document .
book@@ marks from other open documents appear in the menu group@@ ed according to the file names of the other documents .
opens a exist@@ ent project from the hard disk . &amp; quantitative information projects are stored with the Extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . select the selected files then to the project directory .
searched the project directory to new files that could be there . that allows for copying video files in your project folder or folder and add them to the project .
loads the files in your project on the server . the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and if you have downloaded additional inputs / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
att@@ itudes , such as &amp; quantitative ; the project manages . chapter &amp; Pro@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; projects are explained for details .
loads a project tool . these are kept in the Project You / tool@@ bar and are available in this menu when you have assigned them this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bar . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . it creates only the name . actions you need to be stored using settings . tool@@ bars are saved via tool@@ bars or you are asked when asked if you want to save the tool@@ bars .
remov@@ es a tool@@ bar from the field of view . the del@@ etes it not from the hard drive . if you have not yet saved the tool@@ bar , you will be asked if you want to do this .
so you can send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( maybe to the &amp; quantitative information ; -@@ team , so the tool@@ bar will be present in the next publication ) . the menu item will open a new email message with the tool@@ bar as an app@@ endix .
enables the up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where any other can access it . see in .
load an &amp; DT@@ D ; you can convert or anything else has to convert and convert into the &amp; quantitative ; own label format .
load / ref@@ res@@ h of the re@@ alities from the &amp; DT@@ EP ; is meaning@@ ful if the re@@ alities from the &amp; DT@@ EP ; to renew the whole &amp; DT@@ EP ; to renew . if this global is and a write permission in the global K@@ DE file is not present , charging the load .
this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a menu menu which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool bar .
allows access to the current tag dialog when there is one . this entry is always available in menu tags , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menu .
activ@@ ating or Off the intelligent insertion of tags . currently this works only with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent insertion means that &amp; fin@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the insertion means using tool@@ bar if this day contra@@ di@@ ct the rules .
in the plug @-@ up menu , the available plug@@ ins are listed below the menu option . please click on . click on a activated plug@@ ins .
choose the syn@@ taxes mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schem@@ es depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; -@@ Version .
select the type of line identification . very useful if you know people to use other OS platforms to the developers . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
check the syntax of the current document on the basis of the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application T@@ id@@ y .
immediate switch between different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , the switch mode may need time or un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the card reader mode , which is also the default settings , or the lower window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; quantitative ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open window . with a selection of a paper , the appropriate window will be activated .
switch the status bar at the bottom edge of the &amp; quantitative window ; main window to or off .
the changes in this dialog will affect every application that use the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Web@@ b .
this is the behavior of the editorial board . in the documentation of &amp; Kate . in the documentation of &amp; Kate .
a dialog appears where you can delete or modify the entries from the tool@@ bars or to change the sequences .
but this should be a help according to the mouse poin@@ ter , but it is not implemented yet .
&amp; Pro@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed it , but like with any open source project , developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; quantitative ; -@@ development in financial form you will find here the way .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed best from top to bottom , as for example , after filling the project called the whole directory structure for the rest of the project will automatically be completed later with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties can be set later .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file will automatically be filled automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; quantitative ; -@@ project file . by default , it has the name of the project in small letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here is the server address of the machine to which you want to access local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exempl@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 ) are possible .
if you empty this field empty , the default settings of the selected log file can be used . depending on the setup of the remote computer , a adjustment may be necessary .
this is the folder where templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and as standard templates . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standards .
this is the folder where tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and as standard tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files used for different projects should be set instead of the standards .
this allows to insert files from the local file system into the project . multiple files or whole folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . by ser@@ ver@@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you must proceed differently .
p@@ act if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project , should be mounted . if a project is started on new , do not start .
with this option , all files and folders are displayed inside the main folder and you can make an exact selection according to expertise .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the required files by plug@@ ged in or by removing the tick , cl@@ amps out of the project .
the latest screen of the new project assistant contains three settings that can simpli@@ fy your work . these settings can also be up@@ loading in the menu tree in the sub@@ window profiles or with a button Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings are in the project assist@@ ants and are described in detail . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( plac@@ eholder possible ) , which will be re@@ locate in schedule operations such as project folders .
complem@@ entary option to the top , also files that are listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project .
the project view , which will be loaded with opening the project , can be read more about the projection screen .
you can select the desired de@@ bug . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information on G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the deb@@ ug@@ ger plug@@ in can be set using the button options . in addition , trou@@ bl@@ esho@@ oting is described .
in the sub@@ window profiles can also instantly upload high @-@ la@@ de@@ profiles ( see in ) , as well as the display of a construction view for the content of the server for each profile by taking a own architectural view for each profile .
in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , processed or deleted as well as a ma@@ iling list . see details .
in the lower window configuration , you can change event promotions , change or delete these promotions , change or delete . event actions are executed if a previously specific event happens , such as the back@@ ers of a file . see for details .
by default , G@@ ap@@ l@@ us opens ; the last project that was opened . this behavior can &apos;t be influenced by default .
to open a different project , Open Project .... from the menu Project or the Symbol project open from tool@@ bar . the dialog box will display and allows selecting a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension .
if &amp; Pro@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; closed , the project file will be saved automatically . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; quantitative ; changed files . the same happens if you load a new project .
the project management provides free access to the files in the project . the files can be managed in the current project .
folders are as well , but missing items open and open with ... in the right mouse button @-@ available context menu :
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information on the location of the up@@ loaded files . see .
allows the removal of the current profile . if only one profile is available , the button will termin@@ ate to remove the removal .
the password will be kept in the kernel @-@ memory and then forget it . this option is useful if common up@@ loading of files is needed and the rather uns@@ af@@ e pass@@ able password will be saved in question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog when you change your opinion before up@@ loading .
in &amp; Pro@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; many high @-@ charging profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be up@@ loaded to various servers . when editing or creating a profile will appear this dialogue :
that &apos;s the name of the server to which the files are to be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed K@@ IO slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( locally ) and NFS .
the port for the transfer . normally this must not be changed , except the network administrator runs a service on the usual port .
depending on your anxi@@ ety , this is either a time saving function or a danger . use the password stored on the plate , so it is not easy to read , but each with programming knowledge it can easily be seen in plain text .
a project view is only a set of files and tool@@ bars . it can be displayed in a project many views , i.e. by simply di@@ pping the view , several files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the current files and tool@@ bars .
views can be opened in the menu project or the project tool@@ bar , accessible via the tool@@ bars project tool@@ bar , open or deleted .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; quantitative ; with which one has to do most . this helps not only increase productivity but also allows the adaptation of &amp; quantitative information ; to its own work .
as already mentioned above , tool bars &amp; con@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; best on the menu tool@@ bars . use and adding , adding tool bars is treated below in the section of adding tool bars .
the tool@@ bars and the symbols are either set to be set either by context menu ( right click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which new action can be created , it can set other actions like tool@@ bar , tool@@ bar or tool@@ bar , which can be specified in the dialog where the actions can be visible on this or other tool@@ bars .
by calling the context menu to a action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries will be removed and indicated in action that are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bars and the actions on them can set up in the menu with settings of tool@@ bars ... and settings the actions .
templates are in essential docum@@ ent@@ aries , code cut@@ lets and files to lin@@ king . &amp; quantitative information , used as a usual file system with advanced organization and interfaces . one can copy , post@@ p@@ one or any of the system existing directory in the template tree . templates have in &amp; quantitative ; in about restrictions you need to be used for the file system .
some of them with &amp; quantitative ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions used at the beginning of each template .
binary is everything that is not pure text . it can be inserted any file apart from text , so images , &amp; PDF ; bin@@ ocular templates are normally inserted in documents by short@@ cuts ( e.g. images with IM@@ G sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples are found in the template tree under global templates . further information on templates tree is available .
documents can be created from any text documentation . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . normally a simple report for the purpose and organis@@ es work in the appropriate way to be efficient . some examples may be found in the template tree under global templates . see for more information about templates tree .
this type of templates is useful if it is not a new document based on a template , but the same text area is always re @-@ added to documents . you can find everything from a comment about a final note to a complete menu system on JavaScript or Perl basis . some examples are available in the template tree under global templates . see for more information about templates tree .
as the name says , these templates serve for whole websites as templates . you are organized a collection of various documents that can be organized in a compressed t@@ ar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; quantitative information .
create a document structure according to exposure ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and select file as template as local template ....
as soon as it is done , note that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . check in the template tree under project management .
select text in your document and click on file as template @-@ to @-@ use selection as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can easily be drawn with pulling and shut@@ down onto the build @-@ up template .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file is only enough to copy in a pre @-@ level folder . all file management functions can be used , such as clock@@ wise and shut@@ ters or insert about the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can select a folder on the right file or in the project files to create a folder on the right and secure site presentation , but of course it is saved in the project folder , but of course it can be stored as local or global presentation .
project templates allow a very goal oriented approach . you can add head@@ lines and foot@@ lines or dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; create , add files or linked to them . additionally , some things in use of templates can be kept very pro@@ found in projects .
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files stored in $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / quantitative / apps / dice / apps / dice / apps . each of these folders is equivalent to one of four different types of containers , as described above .
to set the behavior of a folder you can click on the folder with the right mouse button on the folder and to select in the context menu Properties . the following dialog appears :
a selection field with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is b@@ lown as soon as the attributes can be inher@@ ited .
this is enabled by default and fit for everything except for the regular folders . if a trunk folder would be set in principle , except it would be explicitly enabled . in case of normal folder , the bl@@ ah would appear with something like text message . if nothing appears , it is likely to be found in a common folder .
allows for a custom or added text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ lines for any templates for a specific project and allows for copying files in a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ lines a complete presentation with the matching head@@ lines / foot@@ lines .
in addition , we have the context menu ( shown on the right mouse button ) via a complete set of command to add folders or copy and add templates from one place to another .
&amp; Pro@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; Source Editor , which can be reached via the menu View . the first mode replaces the source editor in two parts : the source editor and V@@ PL ; Editor .
the V@@ PL ; Editor works as follows : he will load a document such as a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and cur@@ sor . then you can edit and need to be able to use as required for the source code editor in which the carried out changes in V@@ PL ; -@@ editor are visible in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; Editor on a document that contains &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit this directly with V@@ PL ; Editor . it is not possible to edit this directly with V@@ PL ; editing &amp; PHP ; it is still necessary to change this code editor . there is no plans to change this behavi@@ our@@ al code .
the second mode works exactly like the first , except that at the same time the changes in the source editor and in V@@ PL ; Editor is activated and the cur@@ sor in the source editor and in V@@ PL ; this mode has been activated , this mode has already been activated , the key press should keep the active cur@@ sor of a window to the others , where the position is maintained in the document .
the synchron@@ isation interval between the V@@ PL ; Editor and the source editor can be set adjustable via Settings Qu@@ anta .... After choosing V@@ PL ; -@@ View may be set automatically between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . in addition , the recommendation can be set automatically . in addition , the recommendation : a small pot for fast calcul@@ ator and a large pot for slow computers .
suppose you want to change the title of the website , so it is possible to select the description of the invisible tags when working with V@@ PL ; Editor is also called as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; editor will also be called . this is the following change of cal@@ orie code . thus you can change the following :
met@@ a @-@ Tags gives the storage of information about the document itself , e.g. bu@@ zz@@ words for Internet search engines . met@@ a @-@ elements can be added or removed by pressing the two switching surfaces below or removed . a click on the list allows the change of the in@@ hal@@ tes , such as key words in column name and keywords key@@ word keywords .
CSS rules are the new way to design the design of pages in the browser . you can add CSS rules to the list or delete . a change on the list is exactly as with the met@@ a @-@ elements . the processing of CSS rules are currently not supported .
it is possible to integrate with an external CSS style system by pressing the button and select the appropriate file .
the cur@@ sor is like in a text processing , because of evidence with arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cur@@ sor still beha@@ ved as usual . text can be inserted as usual . text can be inserted through in@@ ti@@ d@@ olls and deleted by check or rem@@ over .
the insertion of tags will be done in the same way about tool@@ bars , as in the source editor . it is to be noted that the insertion of tags must not be removed before@@ hand , e.g. a anch@@ ors day , en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed with text , any other surrounding anch@@ ors must be removed .
some tool@@ bars as the tables @-@ assistant or the lists @-@ assistant are disabled . they will be working later in &amp; V@@ PL ; they will be used later in this release the tables or lists of tool@@ bars are used .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the examination of sty@@ list@@ eners . in contrast to other programs for style , the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of sty@@ list@@ eners can be tra@@ cked .

there are many graphic tools for compar@@ isons . why so &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain why I have written .
the mer@@ ging was very complicated , because one of the contribution had changed many changes and simultaneously changed the in@@ wards . another program@@ mers had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts in the assembly .
the program used by me was only the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly was changed within these lines . and there was no references to the places where perhaps only the back@@ feeding had changed . the mer@@ ging of these changes was a small night@@ mare .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; showed differences within one line and changes to white characters . later , any amount of more useful features were added .
if you want to compare fast text , copy it into the clip@@ board and add it into one of the comparative window .
a function made a lot of work was the same and merge of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost in a fully @-@ file @-@ file browser .
also 3 @-@ way inter@@ mitt@@ ance is fully supported . this is useful if two persons can work independently of one piece co@@ de work and changes . the original file ( the base ) helps secure changes . in this editor , you can even edit the result . in this editor , you can even edit the outcome directly . the screenshot shows three Qu@@ ell files when working :
&amp; the diff@@ 3 ; helps you to connect to the same and merge tracking . this screen photo shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; at the folder merge :
&amp; the diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and di@@ stra@@ cted the possibilities of today &apos;s colour monitors . if you have to check Ko@@ de often , you will like this function .
differences in white signs and tab@@ s are visible . if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters , one can see at a glance at the summary in column on the left side . ( no trouble more if I change the in@@ wards . )
when a file is equal , and the other distingu@@ ishes itself in one line , then shows the colour which is different . red color means that both are different to distinguish them .
if all files are the same name , but in different folders , you can easily make the typ@@ ing work by default the file names of the first file . example :
the diff@@ 3 folder , folder , folder , folder , folder , folder , folder , folder , folder , folder , folder , folder , 2 folder
opening dialog enables manual den@@ d@@ olls of fil@@ en@@ ame files that can choose from the file browser ( file ... ) or select a last modified file from the recording list . you will need to specify a third file , if you have to leave the entry for C , the analysis of the differences are done with two files .
via the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , select the same or merge of folders . if for A one file is selected , for B and C , however , select a folder , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the two other folders .
when communic@@ ating is crossed , the input field is active and can be processed . however , it is not necessarily necessary to establish a output file immediately after saving it .
the setup button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can set options before you start with the same / merge .
sometimes you would not like to compare all the file , but only parts of a text compare . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; enables you to select text parts from the clip@@ board in the active comparison window . the comparison starts immediately . in opening dialog you will need to select files , you can simply connect the dialog with the button button .
you can also use pulling and shut@@ ters : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from a editor and let it fall on a comparative window .
what thought is behind it ? sometimes , a file example contains several similar functions . if you want to figure out how these functions are , it would only need to create two appropriate files , download them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; download and compare these relevant sections just to copy , insert and then compare it .
note : currently , you can extract anything from &amp; to diff@@ 3 ; only the fl@@ aw@@ ning of text in a comparative window is supported .
warning : some editors interpre@@ t the pulling and copy of text to another program as cutting and insert ( instead of copying and insert ) . in such case , your original data might be lost .
in the upper part of each text window , the info line contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional ) , let the mouse rest a while on the line . then a small relief window will show the full name . )
the three source star are the letters A , B and C . A has the color blue , B colour green and C is mag@@ enta . ( this default settings can be changed over the settings menu . )
when a difference is recognized , one sees the color that is different . if both files are different , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is especially useful if you compare three files . that is in the next Section ( merge ) .
in addition to the text is the summar@@ ies column . when differences were found , the column displays the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only relevant changes . ( at C / C + + e.g. , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few , rare individual cases relevant . )
the vertical line that separates the combined column of the text is interrupted by the digits where the respective source file has no lines . if the line is activated , the line will be displayed on broken lines .
the results window ( below the comparison star ) also has an info line with the inscription output : the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; h@@ changes &#93; if you already have the result . usually it contains by the automatic mer@@ ing text , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts have been dissolved , the store is de@@ activated ! ! ! ( do not use buttons to next one of the remaining conflicts to find out the remaining conflicts . )
when only two comparative windows are used , every difference is also a conflict which has to be solved .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows , the group is indicated in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed in the windows , where the group is then not visible . ) This group is then highlighted the current group . it is highlighted in the color background colour for current section and on the left is a black beam .
sometimes the automatic merge or by manual processing is no further line more in the group ; then it is indicated in these lines of text &amp; lt ; no line in the Qu@@ el@@ puts ; this text appears to change and perhaps again another source . this text appears not in the final file , yet in a marking which you might need to copy and anywhere else .
the text &amp; lt ; merge operation , but appears in the clip@@ board , when you copy such text from the results window . go carefully with this function .
note : when selecting the sources you ignore or igno@@ red C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are treated as white signs .
navig@@ ates will always be used to use the keyboard and mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you are in one of the window , you can use the arrow keys to the left , beginning , end , C@@ tr@@ l @-@ beginning and Str@@ g end , Si@@ w can also be used by other programs . the over@@ l@@ c@@ ts column may also be used beside the vertical screen bar by clicking on the navigation .
in the eye window , you can also use the other keys to edit . using the insert button , you can switch between insert and outdoor mode . ( default is the plug @-@ in mode . )
one click with the left mouse button in one of the summar@@ ised columns is synchron@@ ized the view of all windows at the beginning of the respective group ( as already in the section M@@ erging and the output window was declared ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump into the current / first / last difference ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture upward ) or to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture in@@ ward ) or to the next / previously un@@ solved conflict . therefore , it must be regarded as conflict between sol@@ uble and un@@ solved conflict .
to copy the marking to the clip@@ board , you need to copy the copying button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or Str@@ g @-@ insert ) . if this activ@@ ates , you need to select automatically into the clip@@ board and copy the manual copying automatically . be careful with this option , because you might over@@ write the content of the clip@@ board .
line @-@ up are stored according to the operating system operating system . UNIX variants use a line @-@ up character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use car folder + line @-@ feed @-@ feed \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 ret@@ ains the line files of the source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not using binary files .
the options and list of the most recently used files are automatically stored and re @-@ produced during the next start . ( menu Settings &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 Read ... )
choose a font with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog appears with variable width to choose from , you should not use it . )
when you activate this option , differences are shown in short text , if the selected font does not support this representation , nothing happens .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in its pure form , but would be ro@@ uted . on these systems the button settings will automatically be an od@@ lit color .
when this option is enabled , the desired number of space is inserted when pressing the Tab@@ ulator button . otherwise , a tab character will be inserted .
if you press the input or return , the reverse line will automatically be used for the next line .
if this option is enabled , each selection will be copied automatically into the clip@@ board . manual copy in the clip@@ board then falls .
you can choose which type of line type you prefer to save . the default value is the commonly used range on the used operating system .
in the same step you tries to find all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white signs can be igno@@ red . in this step , white characters will not be igno@@ red . also , white characters will not be igno@@ red .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a car back sign &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others want to save a line @-@ up &apos; \ &apos; . if this option is activated , car re@@ sign are visible , however , such as a white sign is treated , however , this option has to be disabled . however , this option is de@@ activated .
this option is disabled in the first part of the analysis and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) igno@@ red . in the result the differences are displayed , but they are treated like white signs .
this option is disabled to be disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white signs .
inten@@ sely look for smaller differences . the option is enabled in the default setting . it &apos;s effective for complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files .
in the automatic jump mode , this setting how long the result of the selection is displayed , before the next pending conflict is passed .
dis@@ solves automatically all conflicts in white signs by choosing the chosen file as source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful if you need to igno@@ red the functions of voters A / B / C for all un@@ demanding white conflicts from the merge menu . note that the automatic selection also concerns conflicts in numbers or comments if the options are igno@@ red or igno@@ red C / C + + comments .
these options are treated in the chapter to scanning the folders and merge tracking . look for details under documentation on the directory comparison and merge .
if a file is stored and already an older version exists , then the original version is the suff@@ ix .@@ original attached . if already one such backup file with the suff@@ ix .@@ original , it will be deleted without any further backup .
fit the language of user interface . changing this option is not the current running program . you need to finish and rest@@ art , so that the change is active . ( this option is not available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set globally over the control centre . )
the following coding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , it is used for all entries the upper setting .
above the selection fields for encoding appears a short notice that is the local coding . ( this may not be changed here and has a purely inform@@ al character . )
custom@@ ize the file coding for source files . these influences such as special characters is treated and interpreted as the coding for each file can be adjusted individually , even files can be compared and merged with different coding .
if you have changed a file , you can define which coding is to be used for saving .
if you define procedure commands , they might not work with your codec . ( for example , your files could not work 16 @-@ bit Unicode , but the default command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can define the coding of output commands .
turn this off to supp@@ ress high@@ lighting in white characters in text or over@@ sight . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are igno@@ red or igno@@ red C / C + + comments . )
this selection is only available when you compare three files . in normal mode all differences between two of three files are visible . after selection of A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; B , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; C will be displayed next to the normal still a second over@@ load column with the necessary information .
sometimes you would like to use the available space on the screen rather for long lines . simply select the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
submit the comparison window to each other or to each other . this can also be useful to ads of long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you consider the differences and then decide to merge the files . a simple click will then compare the merge and use the file names of the last source file as a pre@@ set name for the output file . ( if this function is used to rest@@ art the merge , then the name of the last used replacement file will be retained . )
when reading a file it will be handed down to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own pre@@ processing , which corresponds to your requirements . you can use this function e.g. to cut inter@@ f@@ ere parts or to correct the in@@ wards .
when reading a file it was given first to this external command . if a default output command has been given ( see above ) , then the output of the command is used only when using this command line . you can write your own pre@@ processing , which corresponds to your requirements . each input line has to have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind that user is more flexibility when setting up the de@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users don &apos;t want to program this . good news is , however , in most cases SE@@ D or per@@ l is completely sufficient .
use this tutorial command for line @-@ off order to convert the input in upper@@ case letters : SE@@ D &apos;@@ s / \ \ &apos; \ \ 1 / &apos; This . * is an erg@@ o@@ idal expression of any character string . the \ \ 1 in the replacement string refers to the found text in the first cl@@ am@@ mer@@ n@@ few . the \ \ U converts the found text in upper@@ case .
CV@@ S \ $ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \
while you can experiment with SE@@ D , you may get to understand it and perhaps you may see this regular expres@@ sions even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
the igno@@ red of numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for a further pre @-@ processing sequence for line @-@ off right . SE@@ D &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Each character is replaced by nothing but virtually deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform several problems at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; use the creation of each other . example :
instead SE@@ D instead of SE@@ D you can also use something different such as per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ G@@ EX@@ P / replacement / switch &apos; allergi@@ es are per@@ l some details differently . where SE@@ D \ \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs per@@ l only needed ( and ) without the prec@@ urs@@ ing &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
data according to normal pre @-@ processor are maintained for viewing and bring together . the other sur@@ geri@@ es only change the data which the line @-@ off @-@ off @-@ al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus can change .
note : in rare cases when you use a normal processor , the line @-@ up processor provides the output of the normal pre @-@ processor as an input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful but , as with any function which changes the text changes or differences , you can not notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case .
often you have to edit the program@@ mers in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge all the folder re@@ cur@@ sive and merge .
... makes a proposal for bringing a proposal to merge ; you can custom@@ ize the proposal before the start ,
... can sim@@ ulate the merge and sim@@ ulate the sim@@ ulated changes without them .
... performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with the selected objects ( F6 @-@ key ) ,
this is very similar to the same and merge of individual files . you only need to open files on the command line or in the dialog file .
if three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as basis . if no target folder is specified , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folders .
note that only the comparison of folders will automatically start to run the merge , you must select the appropriate menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( further details will follow . )
while reading the folder you will be informed about the current progress . when scanning the folders , only the files are listed , which were compared until then .
if scanning of the folder is completed , shows &amp; diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left , ...
each file and each folder which was found during the scan , will be displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click here .
the folder is usually folded down . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - click , or on the object double or by clicking the arrow keys on the left / right . the directory menu contains two functions All sub@@ directories and all sub@@ directories up with which you can open all the folders .
when you double click on a file , the file format is started and it appears a comparison window .
the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in different folders , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details window to the selected object . in such case the combined cycle promotion can not be selected automatically . if the mer@@ ging is started , you will be informed about problems of this type .
as shown in the above picture , in the columns A / B / C , the colours red , green , yellow and black are used .
when identical entries , the color is identical , even if the age of entries is different .
folders are considered as identical when your entire content is identical . then folders the same color . at folders is the age un@@ considerably for its color .
the idea of this color scheme is based on the diff . the colours reflect the colors of a leaf again , which is only green , then yellow becomes and later when it is old , red will be red .
... A and C identical but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C cannot have the same type of file ( e.g. if A file and B is a file ) : error : contra@@ dic@@ tory dates . as long as such bad objects exist , the mer@@ ging cannot be started .
... A and B doesn &apos;t have the same type of file ( e.g. if A file and B is a file ) : error : contra@@ dic@@ tory dates . as long as such bad objects exist , the mer@@ ging cannot be started .
the mode for synchron@@ izing is active , if only two folders and not exp@@ explicitly mentioned target folders , and if the option directories are synchron@@ ized . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action should be identical , so that both folders are identical ...
... A and B exist , but not identical : assemble and save the result in both folders . ( the user can see the visible file names for the output file only B ; directly after the mer@@ ging , copied &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
if two folders can be merged ( uns@@ af@@ e ) , then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of files are different , but the same date have different , but the date is identical . if such error is not removed , the folders can &apos;t be started .
during working , a file after the other is working . you status column shows pig@@ tig , when the mer@@ ging was successful , and according to other reports , if a result was completed , you should make a final review and see if the status is OK .
when setting up the file similar method is selected , K@@ Diff@@ 3 further columns is selected , this contains the number of conv@@ ents , dissolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for sol@@ uble conflicts will be displayed only if three folders are compared or linked . )
you can either perform the just selected entry ( file or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries at one time . if you have selected all inter@@ f@@ ables @-@ actions ( even in all sub@@ divisions ) you can run the merge .
please note : if you have no target folder , then in the three @-@ folder merge mode C is used as the target , in the two @-@ folder mer@@ ging , B and / or B is used as the target .
if you have selected a target folder , please check if all entries should be displayed in the target folder , too . there are some options that could be ski@@ pped by certain entries . verify these options to avoid un@@ pleasant surprises :
to merge all entries , select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the key root ) . to move only the current entry : select the action of the current element or press F6 .
if by contra@@ dic@@ tory data types , there are still inv@@ alid inter@@ actions exist , a message appears on the incorrect elements . they can then select a valid action .
when you merge all entries , a dialog window appears with the options to withdraw and breaking them .
select Sim@@ ulate if you would like to see what would happen without the really changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then execute certain actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is needed ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window will open ( note the screenshot ) .
if you are ready for a file , select the directory merge / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you are not yet saved , a corresponding dialog appears . then leads &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work will continue with the next entry .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on an error , a message appears and detailed status information . at the end of the list you will help you to try out the cause of the problem . if you want to try the problem to select or the problem entry . so , you have the opportunity to solve a different action for the entry or to solve the problem in another way before you continue with the merge .
if some records were individually assembled , noted &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and leads them not again in later . even if this would result in mer@@ ging , these entries are considered as done . only if you change the mer@@ ging action , these entries will be merged again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 ) has now a section called directory merge with these options :
only files that are displayed on the specified pattern will be displayed in the element tree . multiple patterns can be entered . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( eg . * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default file is not equal to this pattern .
files and folders that correspond to this pattern will not be displayed in the element tree . it can be entered in the element tree , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original * .@@ O .
files and folders that correspond to this pattern will not be displayed in the element tree . it can be entered in the element tree , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original * .@@ O .
igno@@ red files that would also be igno@@ red by CV@@ S . the great advantage is that this folder can be adjusted with .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have a Verst@@ appen -@@ attri@@ bute . in other file systems marks a leading point . this option lets you decide whether these files are displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in the default settings .
for links to files : if the option is switched off , the symbolic link should be compared if the option is switched on , the files are compared to which the links are disabled . this is de@@ activated in the default settings .
for links based on folders : if the option is switched off , the links are treated like normal folders and recur@@ sively . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not on possible rec@@ asts . a link to a folder which lead to itself would lead to a final loop and sli@@ pp@@ le 3 ; crash@@ es off . ) This option is shut down in the pres@@ et@@ ting .
performs a complete analysis of each file by and shows the statistics columns . ( the number of dissolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and considerably slower when it is applied to files that contain no text . ( enter an appropriate anti @-@ pattern ) .
if you compare large file via a slow network , it is maybe faster to compare the change date and the file size . please note that this option is to be careful of security . please check this option in default .
similarly to the change date . there is no real comparison instead . the files are considered as identical if it is equal to change the change date lost . please be used with caution . this option is shut down in default .
activ@@ ating the synchron@@ izing mode if two folders are compared and no target folders . in this mode , the proposals are identical to that both folders are identical . also the results of merge files are stored in both folders . this option is shut down in the default settings .
if there are differences , the copying of the newer file is suggested as action . ( this is thought that the other file does not have changed . ) This option is shut down in any case . ) This option is shut down in default .
if a file or a folder will be replaced or deleted , then the original version is renamed and gets the extension .@@ original . if an old backup file already exists , it will also be deleted without further backup . this option also concerns the result of individual files , not only the whole folder . this option is enabled in the default settings .
normally , the folders merge pane remains visible in the fusion of individual files ; you can switch off the window divider with the mouse . if you do not want to switch the window or text window , you can switch the window &amp; text window between the two views between the two views .
probably you prefer to compare a file easily by clicking with double click . however , you can also run a single file using the merge menu . as soon as you save the result , the status will be done and the file will not run once , when you run the folder .
this status goes however , if you want to read the directory again : directory -@@ menu : read new
K@@ DE supports network transparent with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folders to open to local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file using a FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has some other syntax as local files and folders . some things you should note :
a path can be relatively and .. or .. not included . that &apos;s not possible with UR@@ Ls , these are always absolute .
special characters must be cas@@ c@@ aded . ( # - &gt; % 23 , empty index &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes by the protocol . it follows a short list of restrictions :
or it cannot be differenti@@ ated if a link is based on a file or folder . then a file will always be accepted as link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to process per@@ missions or change@@ over date . therefore , the per@@ missions or change of change from the original . ( note that option is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose of use is currently as differences in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op starts to start the built @-@ in Differ@@ ences . to start K@@ diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the differences of the viewer and then select in K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu .
normally you need &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two full input files . if it is applied to the format , it takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch file is required from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file .
in the context menu , you can select a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that if not the original files exists , it is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since generation of the patch file .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports the same of two files , a very small tool bar and menu . the merge or the same of folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diff@@ 2 ( now it is com@@ est ) there is already . in addition , the name K@@ diff@@ 3 indicates that it can merge together like the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff Tool collection .
I use the GPL programs already very long and have learned a lot by searching in the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all program@@ mers that have gone this way or to go so .
you have probably compiled the program from the sources and configure the right pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in default , in / usr / local , K@@ DE will not find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file you will find more information about this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines will be first identical as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is not identical . if it is not identical , if the rate is not identical , this is the V@@ is @-@ the case .
the editor notes for any difference in the files where he starts and where he ends . this important information is lost if the result is just stored as text file and it is too much effort to create extra @-@ own file format that could store this information .
the effort was too large so far . you can always recover certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger quantities of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text is suddenly lt ; no sr@@ c lin@@ s ; released and the text can &apos;t delete . what does this mean and how can this be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; already used many colors for lifting differences . even more high@@ lighting would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . use another editor to do it .
many good ideas and trou@@ bl@@ esho@@ oting came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you will need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later .
information about how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE you can find on the homepage .
a list of recent changes can be found under ht@@ t@@ p : / / / diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ angel@@ og or in the file ch@@ angel@@ og in the Qu@@ ell package .
to comp@@ ile and install &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; comp@@ ile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir gives you the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are uns@@ af@@ e , you will find further details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file .
da &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake uses , you should not have problems with comp@@ ile . should not difficulty occur , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mail@@ ing@@ lists of it .
remove ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ Remove ) copied to the clip@@ board and remove the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ insert ) add the text from the clip@@ board to the current cur@@ sor position or replaces the current marking .
only differences are shown : files that are identical in all folders are not appear in the folder , and therefore not in target folders .
( in the current program version you need to read on these options the folder with the function Update . )
only entries are displayed , the differences may have to be copied to the target folder . if the target file does not already contain these files , they are missing according to the target . ( the behavior is likely to be switched on in a later program version . ) This option is shut down in default .
note the buttons to choose from the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you are attached to one of the buttons , the lines are attached to the end of the selected group at the end of the selected group ( if they are not already available ) , if the lines are already available , then click on the button again .
this option is disabled this option . differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white signs .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; shows a miniature preview of all virtual spaces . it is quite convenient to change their size programs on the work surfaces , to finish her size or post@@ p@@ one . this works in both desktop and several .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work areas as well as those in the current applications . applications can be selected and even on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button windows can be moved within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; motion is possible both within a desktop and other work@@ space .
the context menu depends on how the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; click here , the context menu will appear only the two entries P@@ ager ; however , there are also the symbol and the name of the application as well as the entries Minim@@ ize , maxim@@ ize , on top and sending . the commands do the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window on the full size of the desktop . appears only if it was cli@@ cked on a application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . appears only if it was cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is marked , windows can be moved within the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other work surfaces .
if this field is crossed , in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the names of virtual work areas are displayed .
cross the field leaves the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; view the numbers of virtual work areas . it is linked together with names , are provided by the name to be ordained , &amp; eg ; 1 . desktop .
if this field is crossed , the background of each desktop will also appear as background in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; shown in the background .
if this field is crossed , the current programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only the empty work@@ space will be displayed to allow their selection .
here is the view of the program window . simply shows simple rectangle with the propor@@ tions of program windows . symbol shows the window with its standard symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very quick systems .
the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; -@@ main window will be determined : classic provides &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2 @-@ n grid , like from P@@ ager applications in some other window managers , horizont@@ ally shows all virtual spaces in a horizontal line , which is very good for the presentation side on the desktop .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager Mini@@ program in the Control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , view windows as symbols or with their content and move it outside the control bar .
click the right mouse button within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and subsequent trig@@ gering of switching switches ... can appear the dialog for Settings .
currently this is not changed in the dialog for Settings . but you can do it manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ p@@ ag@@ err@@ c using any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you have no write permission for the file , you must use the key win@@ dow@@ transparent mode and assign it to this file . possible values are :
da &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package base is needed , you will need a working installation of the K@@ DE basic packages .

&amp; k@@ itt@@ eth ; is a screen magni@@ fier . you can use &amp; k@@ mag . this application is interesting for different users . this application is interesting for different users : this documentation includes artists , web designers and people with a vision . this documentation is to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ may ; be .
&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly expanding for new functions . it is optimised for use on high @-@ performance computers .
when you get &amp; k@@ able , a window appears as above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; shows the enlarged range of screen . in the following , this window will be displayed as a magni@@ fication window . the image that is displayed in the magni@@ fication window is an enlarged area of the screen and is described in the following as a selection window .
in the default setting it increases &amp; k@@ mag ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter like a mobile horn . alternatively , you can arrange a selected screen area in the magni@@ fication window ( selection dialog ) or the surroundings of the mouse poin@@ ter ( eg ; on the left screen ) .
if you want to avoid the mouse indicator in the enlarged window , select the mouse poin@@ ter . please note that it is not able to detect the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the standard k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse poin@@ ter .
in the selection window mode , you can custom@@ ize the select window to your own needs . you can shift it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fication window and hold down the left mouse button , so you can catch the contents of the magni@@ fying button and post@@ p@@ one . this also goes with the arrow keys .
if you want to press &amp; Shift ; press &amp; M@@ MB ; in addition , you can move the select window .
with this combination , you can change the size of the selection dialog . note that the upper left corner of the selection dialog will remain and only move the lower right corner .
&amp; k@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , copy to a file to insert it into the clip@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , turn the image and much more .
running or stops the update of the update . the stops of updating causes that the required CPU time is set to 0 .
select the ref@@ res@@ h rate ( Very low , low , medium , high , Very high ) . the higher the ref@@ res@@ h rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a selection window will be displayed . the selected area will be displayed in one window .
&amp; k@@ mag ; used automatically your set @-@ up files to save files , opening a new window , printing , ne@@ bul@@ g@@ aden ( with the button document once load in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; ) , Enlarge and sm@@ iling &amp; etc .
k@@ not@@ ch also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen magni@@ fier . you can use &amp; cle@@ fier ; to use a magni@@ fier in order to view the cl@@ utch covered in a newspaper or a photo . this application is for different people of benefits : from research or artist until web designer or vis@@ ually handic@@ apped .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter for a while on the same spot . it is thought to help people suffer from the RS@@ I syndrome ( repet@@ itive strain rate ) syndrome , and in which each mouse click pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter for a while on the same spot . it is thought to help people suffer from the repet@@ itive strain relief ( RS@@ I ) syndrome , and to which each mouse click pain . furthermore , it also requires a little exercise .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can remove the pain when using the mouse , and helps to use the mouse to use the mouse without pain . unfortunately , you may receive p@@ ains due to the use of your computer . unfortunately , you should receive a doctor if this is not yet done .
in order to clear it even more clear : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool should avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse , it is against pain , which can be caused by the mouse , effective . and as with all ergonomic aid agencies : the result can vary per differently .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and leads a mouse click as soon as you break the movement .
if the smart move is activated , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break after it expi@@ res the mouse button . in this way , you can run the mouse when pressing the mouse button . the intelligent move requires a little exercise , but you can get used quickly .
this life time must be stopped after the end of the mouse movement before and k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click away .
if Intelli@@ gen@@ es is switched on , the shooting time is set ( 1 / 10 s ) . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after shut@@ down the mouse button is waiting before it leaves the mouse button again , if there is no evidence of the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; supports this function enabled , creates a slow move by right and back , followed by a break , one click with the right mouse button . a slow motion is stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt for the first time , but they can be changed later .
if the sound is delayed , you can move &amp; k@@ de ; to prevent the reaction time . open the &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; , go on Sound &amp; Multimedia , choose the sound system and here the rider of General . there is a sli@@ der sound buffer that you can adjust to a lower value to reduce the response times .
if this setting is marked , this setting is started &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at any start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently under &amp; k@@ de ; available . at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments please select the relevant documentation to figure out how to start a program automatically .
set all settings on the values that were set when opening the dialog . have already pushed the button in the button , the settings are reset to the last pressures of users .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; initially with the default settings . in particular , smart move should first be switched off . if you want to get used to the automatic mouse , you can later make the smart move .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; with sounds .
first you should be aware of what places remains a mouse click without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or on places in the browser window , which does not show a link , does not lead to park un@@ inten@@ tional reactions . you can use the mouse to park such places until you want to use it again .
if your mouse is jer@@ ky , you should clean your mouse . that &apos;s normally pretty easy . the trick is that you can not only cleanse the mouse , but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse .
first you need to remove the mouse ball . as it happens , from mouse to mouse , it should be clear when you watch the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the sphere was used . the trick and pollution can easily scra@@ pped easily with a flat blade or the fing@@ ern@@ a@@ gel .
in very rare situations , the operating system breaks the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if in this case , in this case , the smart move has been started , means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation does not end any more by the right mouse button .
this happens if you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use a window manager and move one window .
the solution for this problem exists , that you even run a mouse click here . this is the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; reset and you can work as usual .
problem : if you enter the text , tries &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to carry mouse clicks and continue the cur@@ sor to another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor there . however , you can use the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop , if you don &apos;t want to make sure that the mouse clicks are un@@ inten@@ tional reactions . secure zones for the mouse poin@@ ter , &amp; eg ; the gray surfaces around the tool@@ bars and menus and the front@@ lines of windows .
I &apos;m trying to work with the smart move , but I do not create it to edit the text .
the smart move is a advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it &apos;s very probably possible to move it into the clip@@ board or to move any other action when you want to move your mouse over the pressing mouse button . however , there will probably be some problems here . here are some advice about it :
use the smart move not only if you &apos;re just getting started &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to use . select text instead as follows : perform a mouse button on the end of the text area , while keeping the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and use the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . as a mouse click here , when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button ex@@ presses the sound as a mouse click . later you can use the smart move also without the audi@@ ble mouse click here . however , it needs some exercise .
to be able to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; you have to install the X@@ test extension for &amp; X Window , which should already be the case on most system .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and speakers and are set correctly .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; bet@@ ting the mouse button as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter . this program was developed for people who suffer from the RS@@ I syndrome and has prepared the firm of the ma@@ sts pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured as configured that there is a specific time to wait that a pulling process begins before the mouse button is left . in this way the pulling and shut@@ down with the mouse can also be performed .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that can cause your computer to answer your computer .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; the user can select the computer for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the talk of the phr@@ ases that are supposed to be spoken again .
on the first side of the assistant ( left screen photo ) enter the command which will be used later for the language output of text . further details can be found in the description of the setup dialog .
on the second page , select the standard text adjustment book . from the text@@ books you can often choose text pass@@ ers , without having to type them . the passages can be processed naturally .
on the third page ( right screen photo ) , select the Dictionary for the Wor@@ ker . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the selected language to determine the frequency of the individual words . additionally , you can listen to the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org Dictionary , so only a letter sp@@ elling words in the Wor@@ ker .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clearly structured and contains essentially an input field for the keyboard entries of your propositions ( the lower white field on screen photo ) and a run time of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field on screen photo ) .
if you commit k@@ mouth ; you can enter the sentences you want to type in the input field which you want to hear . any given sentence will be attached to the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . you can select it out of it that should be spoken once again .
with the menu entry Settings k@@ mouth ; open the setup dialog for &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two cart@@ ons , voice output and settings , the page of Wor@@ ker and the page K@@ TT@@ SD voice service .
in the input field voice output release , enter the command to the command of the language . in the selection field , place the character code to be transmitted using the text on the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box when the text is not given as default to the language generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text is transferred as parameters . you can use the following placement holders :
of course the command to the language output depends on your voice generator . this command can be found in the documentation to your voice generator . examples for this you will find in App@@ endix .
with as possible use as a language service , &amp; k@@ mouth ; as the first attempt to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD voice service , the kt@@ on , the &amp; k@@ de ; applications is a standardized interface for language output and is currently being developed by SV@@ N . the selection of this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection field promotion according to the selection of a text passage , select which action is triggered by selecting a text passage in the menu text string or in the vest for text@@ books .
with the selection of So@@ fort , the selected text passage will be inserted directly and additionally inserted into the input field . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage will initially be entered into the input field .
with the second selection field Sch@@ mitt@@ ance of the machining window for text pass@@ ers , you can define whether the text password register can be stored automatically when closing the window window .
with the selection of text pass@@ able book , the book is stored . if you choose any changes , the text password register is not stored . if you ask them , you will ask &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text password register is to be stored .
the page Wor@@ ker contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the Wor@@ ker . in the main window shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection field if this list contains more than a dic@@ tionary . with this selection field , you can choose the currently used dic@@ tionary to Wor@@ ker .
with buttons on the side you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries or add the order of books or exp@@ orting them into a file . below the list you can adjust the language and select the language for the dic@@ tionary .
select the language used for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; read the &amp; k@@ not ; documentation one . the pre@@ valence of individual words is simply determined by the number of individual words . in addition , you can compare the voc@@ abul@@ ary with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org Dictionary in order to add just correctly written words into the new dic@@ tionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; asks which dic@@ tion@@ aries are summarized , and how they are to be given .
with this option you create a new , empty Dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly introduced words automatically add to the dic@@ tionary , create a dic@@ tionary with your voc@@ abul@@ ary during the time .
the main field of the window for machining text@@ books is divided into two . in the upper part , the text@@ books are displayed as a tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can select the text passage or the corresponding key root . if you have selected a text editor , you can only change its name .
actions like new passages or books to add or delete books or delete books either via the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a hing@@ ed menu .
the sequence of text@@ books or text pass@@ ages allows you to change with the mouse to the new position or with the arrow keys and the Alt + key .
the selected text is selected and copied to the clip@@ board . if in the input field a text section is selected , this will be used otherwise the selected areas of the exp@@ iry .
the selected text is copied to clip@@ board . if in the input field a text section is selected , this will be used otherwise the selected areas of the buffer .
the currently active sentence is spoken , if the text is located in the input field , it will be used otherwise the selected sets of the program memory .
if this menu entry is crossed , a sli@@ dable tool@@ bar is displayed with buttons for frequently used commands . the tool@@ bar is located directly under the menu bar . by mouse click on the left @-@ left side and pulling the tool@@ bar to another place .
if this menu entry is crossed , a narrow l@@ ath in the lower part of the main window with hin@@ ts about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed if not crossed , this status bar is b@@ lown out .
if this menu entry is crossed , a sli@@ p@@ able glue is displayed directly under the tool@@ bar . by clicking on the pl@@ umb@@ ing left side and pulling , the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place .
probably you have not entered the command for the language output , not properly or incomplete . open Settings k@@ mouth ; open the page General Settings and enter the command for language output in a speech output . ( see setup dialog for Spe@@ ech syn@@ thesizer for further details . )
the festival is a speech output system of the Edinburgh University . currently , only English , Spanish and W@@ alis@@ er are supported . the license allows to use the festival for free and without restrictions .
in order to show an example of the command line for setting the speech output , the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival line . the command to the language output is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is an in &amp; Java ; written voice generator . currently , it only supports the English pron@@ unci@@ ation . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and distribute without restrictions .
in order to show an example of the command line for setting up the speech output , Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in / usr / local / fre@@ et . the language output is then possible using one of the three following commands :
for the third example , the option must be switched on . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS ) .
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a voice generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ ming into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to de@@ file the text in phon@@ eme . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text in phon@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , under the assum@@ ption that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA in / usr / local / sister fax and / usr / local / mb@@ rol@@ a are installed .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax is happy to write the final character of the text , so that an additional character must be attached . the full command is therefore more elabor@@ ated than in the other examples :
( CAT - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / hadi@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BAR _ / usr / local / mb@@ rol@@ a / de@@ 1 / usr / local / mb@@ a / de@@ 1 / usr / usr / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; art@@ spl@@ ay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option is required to send the data as standard entries .
the speech output of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language service , which provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications is a standard interface for language output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed by SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different language output systems .
as the settings of the language can only be done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use the kt@@ ts@@ d as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ;
to setup , use the page K@@ TT@@ SD voice , which appears in the setup dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; you need a speech generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the voice generator ) , but it depends on the individual of your computer and configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application that cannot speak written by the calcul@@ ator . it is saved a list which can always be saved by the calcul@@ ator that the user can re@@ locate again .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; not a language syn@@ thesizer . a language syn@@ thesizer has to be installed on the computer .

the speech output of &amp; k@@ de ; an application without visible windows , offering the T@@ TS services via &amp; D@@ bus ; offers :
a application with &amp; GUI ; for configuration and installation of kt@@ ts@@ d over kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the system section .
a module for the web browser &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a web page or parts of it .
a module for the text editor &amp; Kate ; which can be read or partially read by a text file .
in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you can find discussions on &amp; kt@@ ops ; you can subscribe to ht@@ t@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / k@@ de @-@ Acc@@ essi@@ bility . the developers can also be found in the I@@ RC ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , channel # k@@ de @-@ Acc@@ essi@@ bility ) .
before you can use &amp; meet you , you will need to install program @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher and properly set . see also
for the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as there is not a speaker , the card ticket is displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker , the card chart will be displayed . see .
most T@@ TS @-@ syn@@ thesizer offer various languages and voices , such as various male or female , or such that differ as speaker or speed . you can also use several variants for a syn@@ thesizer . you should use at least one speaker before you use &amp; kt@@ ops , since the program speed @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise uses the standard equipment .
different spokes@@ person for the same syn@@ thesizer is comparable with several prints for the same printer .
if you click on the boxes card reader in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the card card speaker is displayed automatically when you want to start the kt@@ m@@ gr and has not been set up again .
all the speakers are appearing in this list . the preferred speakers are shown above in the list . the top speaker is used for language output if an application does not exist .
choose a mouse click on the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
choose a mouse click on the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
choose a mouse click on the list , and click on this button to push the nar@@ rator in the list a line further down . the sequence of nar@@ rator in the list is also determined its priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; -@@ System .
choose a vote type , there are three male and three female voices , as well as a Jun@@ gen@@ - and girl &apos;s vote .
if you click here , click on the new speaker on the card speaker . to change the settings of this speaker , click on Edit menu .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; already almost use . go back to box ticket and check if language output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , so the T@@ TS Service of &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; use to read text in order to create text applications and manage . see .
if you have at least one speaker , you can open the language output system from &amp; k@@ de ; click on the map card reader to open this map card . here you can set some general options .
check out this check box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ts ; this start is successful , and you can create text orders and read text applications and read text applications , and you can read text applications and read the T@@ TS system by &amp; k@@ de ; it is de@@ activated .
when kt@@ m@@ gr is finished , it sp@@ ends ; on , if the box is dis@@ able ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , the box is crossed ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if this check box is marked and kt@@ m@@ gr will appear automatically in the system area of the control bar , dis@@ appears once the lecture is closed .
using buttons in this series , you can start text applications , stop , stop and hold back .
with buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; stop@@ watch template or read a text file to the pre@@ read . you can also change the speaker for one order .
click on any user or OK then all the changed settings are taken on all sides .
the board ticket orders will only be displayed if K@@ TT@@ SD is started . in order to get K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the map card reader and cross the language output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; you can check the text of the displayed website . check first if &amp; kt@@ ts ; runs . then select the text , which should be read , and then choose the text menu tools . after a short time , the language should begin .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a website . you can also ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; -@@ pre@@ st@@ ressing and other invisible brands also be found .
in &amp; Kate ; the extended text editor by &amp; k@@ de ; you can check this text . check first if &amp; kt@@ ts ; runs . then select the text , which should be read , and then choose the language menu Tools text . then the language output should start .
this also works , if &amp; Kate ; embedded in other applications such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; quot ; .

in &amp; conversation ; , the I@@ RC program of &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up different types of messages . you can use &amp; convers@@ ational ; for example , if you are notified if you will notice in a I@@ RC channel , in which your nick@@ name comes . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can then read the I@@ RC message text .
supports a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Program K@@ not@@ ation , an menu entry messages in the menu settings of this program . here is the possible settings for the not@@ ices , depending on the application .
filter to correct filter suspension , we offer a good possibility in &amp; kt@@ ts ; this is a good example . it is a good example . it remov@@ es tags b@@ r and b out of the messages which is sent by mail , and additionally the expression / local / in@@ box , since that in most cases can be accepted as required . read also .
filters are one of the advanced abilities of &amp; kt@@ ops ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; are filters not required .
fil@@ tering text is processed before being sent to the program &quot; @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for the improvement of the language to replace false words or ab@@ brevi@@ ations , a matching language and speaker or to avoid some lack of language synthesis and their voices .
to understand the tasks of fil@@ tering , it is important to know how the program &quot; &quot; @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distingu@@ ishes four kinds of texts .
the edition of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it will continue to all the orders and will keep these orders . if the edition of the Screen reader is presented , the orders will be resum@@ ed again .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning has priority and keeps the edition of messages and normal text . these orders will be resum@@ ed after the edition of the warning .
News have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that can read messages . while you &amp; eg ; one long text on a web site can welcome you with &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone welcome to enter the room . &amp; k@@ de ; al@@ er@@ ts are also news . read this .
the rest are simple text applications . any order you use from cardboard card orders is a textbook . KS@@ ay@@ it is an example of applications that use text applications . KS@@ ay@@ it is intended for the output longer texts that possess any special pressure .
all four orders are handled in qu@@ eu@@ e , with the exception of the edition of Screen re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a screen @-@ reader , during &amp; kt@@ ts , this issue will keep and finished .
first you have to know that filters will never be applied to the output of Screen re@@ a@@ dern . you will be applied to normal war@@ nings , messages and text agreements as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News .
filters edit the text and pass it to the next filter . at present there are three types of filters .
filters are executed as modules . in the future there can be even further types of filters .
replacement strings replace parts of a text through other text . specify the replacement parts can be delivered either as words or regular expres@@ sions , which enable the replacement of chat @-@ che@@ ek such as : - ) by text or for the conversion of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understanding form .
&amp; XML ; -@@ re@@ former use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language Trans@@ forms ) around &amp; XML ; from a format into another format . included in the scope of supply and are some X@@ SL@@ T files for translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; included in SS@@ ML .
you can send orders according to the text content or depend on the text , which has sent the text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent to a speaker . if you have set the text for female voice , you can read text by K@@ DE @-@ News about it . Si@@ eh@@ e. read about that .
each of these different filters has set adjustable rules after which it is applied for a language output . if the filter is determined that its rules will not be applied , he gives the text unchanged at the next filter .
if a text message , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification is sent and sent through all activated filters , which were set up on the side down . the processing through the filter occurs in the order from top to bottom .
this shows the list of standard normal filters . if a filter is not crossed , it is not activated and is not used . filter the series will be processed from top down below .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and it will be shown below the below set @-@ up dial@@ ogues .
for the device of character filters you need to enter a list of words or regular expres@@ sions as a comparison type . these patterns will be replaced in the text , then the text is exchanged against the corresponding replacement text .
specify a name for your filter . you can choose any name as desired , it must be different from the name of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expres@@ sions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in column match and replaced it in accordance with the character string from the column . the list is processed in the displayed order from above below .
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
with these buttons you can download a list of words or regular exp@@ editions from a file , save the current list or delete . download a list from a file , the entries from the file will be attached to the existing list .
here is a language listed , the filter is only applied if the speaker is used for the text in the here . click on the button to press a list of languages . you can also hold several languages if you press the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l key press .
if a value is listed here , the filter is only applied if the text is from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separately by Kom@@ mat@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail

the speech output API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with the program@@ mers can give their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD over &amp; D@@ bus ;
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the voice syn@@ thesizer , can be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that they can use this syn@@ thesizer .
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ bus ; -@@ Interface of the speech output API from &amp; k@@ de ; the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is will be found on the k@@ de ; Acc@@ essi@@ bility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / Cor@@ bil@@ it@@ y.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .

none of the mentioned voice syn@@ thesizer supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ Shift filters , but when using the module for festival web pages are not specified .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 , you need to install the ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone , so S@@ able is not able to do so if you do not use this voice to read from websites . make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c installed and above the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H .
certain signs or pun@@ ctu@@ ation characters seem to cause error in syn@@ thesizer , so that whole propositions were ski@@ pped or only Kau@@ der@@ y . what can I do against it ?
first , make sure the option is set for the appropriate value for the respective language . if problems with certain character or words , this may be fixed by a character string filter . see .

KT@@ TS works with any voice syn@@ thesizer that can be launched at the command line in one &amp; console .
the list of the above languages can be un@@ complete or ob@@ sol@@ ete . therefore , select the description of syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . check also on the website of kt@@ ts ; , according to information that are not included in this manual .
the program &quot; &quot; @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; uses a adap@@ tive module architecture for voice syn@@ thesizer . if you want &amp; kt@@ ts ; to use other syn@@ thes@@ izers , use the developer team in conjunction with the development team .
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter is , but is not necessarily necessary . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the command ap@@ t @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to comp@@ ile &amp; kt@@ ops , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( Version 3.4 or later ) including the c@@ deli@@ bs and the program files for the program &quot; &quot; @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
if you have purchased the source text from &amp; kt@@ ts ; you have downloaded and install the tar@@ ball of the source code created every night or re@@ install the program with the following commands :
before you can use &amp; kt@@ ops , check first if the @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher works correctly with your voice syn@@ thesizer . you can use the Sh@@ ell@@ sign SPD @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ops used ; the program dict@@ t@@ ms@@ gr is to be further developed so that the device of the disp@@ at@@ cher is not possible and the script SPD @-@ conf is no longer required .
a long text is dist@@ orted in individual movements . the user can go back or retri@@ eve it or cancel the output .
if an application text on &amp; kt@@ ts , you can specify a female speaker for the output . for example , if you have a speaker up , whose language is English and its gender , this is used , otherwise the best matching speaker is chosen . if you want more about it , like &amp; kt@@ ts , you can see a speaker .
if you click on the card &apos;s speaker to add or click on the map , click on the list and click on Edit menu , for example , the boxes of the module for Festival Interactive is shown below . for details on the modules you will find under .
enter the path to the detailed festival program . if the path to festival included in P@@ AT@@ H , you must only enter the festival .
select the editor for Text that will be handed over to the Festival . for voices , the &amp; kt@@ ops , this setting will be made automatically . generally , Western languages are ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak . ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders , make volume , microphone speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select a few controller and display this gray , the voice can not be selected by you .
some voices such as Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices will need to be loaded several seconds due to their size . if you mark this check box , these voices will already be loaded with the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that ( at greater memory consumption ) the first set will be syn@@ thes@@ ized .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not set up one speaker ( or forgot to click on any user ) .
if this check box is marked when starting from kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr the program window is visible , but not the program window is visible , but not the program window . click the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if this check box is marked and kt@@ m@@ gr does not run , it appears in the system area , as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . as a result , you have the opportunity to read or ste@@ aling it otherwise .
here are all the orders listed in the waiting long , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of propositions and the just worked set . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the card card speaker .
with buttons in this series you can select sat@@ in in the order that is selected or returned in the list below . ( but not each order is composed of several sets ) .
with one click on OK all changes from the settings ( also on the other card cards ) and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be sc@@ aled down to the icon in the system section . click the icon to display the program window .
if the sound system &amp; art is not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the Map card audio . see also .
here only text applications are listed and administered . editions of Screen ref@@ uses , war@@ nings and messages are not displayed . further information on the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in .
select the kind of audio output . if one component can not be selected , was compiled &amp; read ; either without support for the corresponding audio module , or &amp; kt@@ ts ; can &apos;t load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de for the audio output is to be used , select the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you need to install at least one module . have AL@@ SA selected , select the PCM device . see also
make the microphone speed here . 50@@ n@@ bsp ; % corresponds to approximately half and 200@@ n@@ bsp ; % about the double normal speaking speed . so these settings can be converted , the program SO@@ X will be installed .
click on applic@@ ator to take the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; -@@ system .
the list of AL@@ SA tools includes all PCM devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you &apos;ll need to figure out which device works with you . in doubt , choose Standard .
on this card map , you can always configure particular actions which will always be executed if the text contract is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of voice contracts :
the edition of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it will be submitted to all other orders and will keep these orders . once the edition of the Screen reader has been read , the orders received will be resum@@ ed .
war@@ nings have priority priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning keeps the edition of messages and normal text . these orders will be resum@@ ed after reading the warning .
News have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that can read messages . if you read &amp; eg ; just a long text on a website , you can welcome you with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone welcome you to enter the room .
if a text contract is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen @-@ reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output into the qu@@ eu@@ e one .
this audio file will always be played when a normal text is interrupted . if both the introduc@@ tory sound is active as well as introduc@@ tory message , the introduc@@ tory sound will be played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this card chart is valid only for normal text applications . for news , war@@ nings and the issues of Screen re@@ forms , there are no particular actions when these are interrupted by a message with higher priority .
to start with &amp; kt@@ ts ; K@@ not@@ ation messages can be found , launch kt@@ m@@ gr and click on al@@ er@@ ts . the al@@ Card is al@@ er@@ ts .
mark this check box to switch to read &amp; read ; dis@@ simulation devices . if this setting is not selected , the other settings are disabled and / kt@@ ts ; reads no al@@ er@@ ts .
if this setting is marked , al@@ er@@ ts , where a sound is played , of &amp; kt@@ ts ; not specified .
use these buttons to add events or delete events . if you click on the button , a dialog appears to you to select the application and the event you want to add to list .
this event reads the message before , the &amp; conversation ; sent when someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an I@@ RC message .
all events , which is not stated in the list , will be igno@@ red by &amp; kt@@ ts ; igno@@ red .
use this selection field to define what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do if an event hits . you have the following selection options :
if you selected custom text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholder :
you can enter here the characteristics of the desired microphone station . default select the speaker that is displayed on the box card speaker as the lower entry . see also .
note that there are three levels of events . if a specific event is specified in a specific application , this promotion will run out . otherwise the action is defined for all other events of specific application . as the last option the action is to carry out under standard ( all other events ) .
the event All noti@@ fications for the Application Standard ( all other events can not be deleted from the list . for this , you can define the al@@ ert noti@@ fications as follows :
use the button Save to save the settings for the al@@ er@@ ts in a file . the invited events will start with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click on delete . all entries except all unauthorized devices will be deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3C standard to select text for the control of voices , the speaking speed , the volume , the sex of voice and pitch . in addition , marks for the control of dis@@ appoint@@ ments . SS@@ ML is a part of the Vo@@ ice@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3C standard .
currently , &amp; kt@@ ts are currently supported ; SS@@ ML only partly and only in the basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you need to install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) since that is the standard voice , the festival is used in the issue of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or audio system in the festival configuration dialog is not set to 100@@ n@@ bsp ; % is usually spoken very mon@@ ot@@ on .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and set limit filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . therefore , the first proposition must start automatically , as only the first movement must be syn@@ thes@@ ized , not the whole text order . so you can also stop or sc@@ oop out or break even if the voice syn@@ thesizer is not directly supported .
here you see the set @-@ limit filters . during the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is automatically set up as a pre @-@ limit filter filter . you can change its settings or add other pro@@ pon@@ ent filters , but they will not use it .
on the easiest way you can select the device selection by selecting the speaker selection . if you select the microphone selection again , change some features and check out how the selection of the microphone has changed . for this purpose you have to set up more than a speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then qu@@ icker with the preview can start , since only the first proposition must be processed and not the whole text block which can last very long .
select text orders then on board ticket orders or break it , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal setting limit filters will be set automatically when you start the kt@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be removed only . do not change anything about this filter unless you know what you do .
compare text with a regular expression of pro@@ positi@@ onal and add a tab@@ ulated sign ( Dec@@ imal code 8 ) to the set limits ( tab@@ im@@ als are removed from the text ) . note that the default movement filter filter has the character set .
S@@ BD filters will never be applied to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News ( coding ) , war@@ nings , messages or the output of Screen Re@@ aders .
once you have removed the normal setting limit filter , you can once again insert it by clicking it in &amp; kt@@ ts ; it contained _ sb@@ dr@@ c file .
the card interface selection allows you to over@@ write the microphone settings for application . the card card will be displayed if
use of the standard speakers ( the top on the card speaker ) . with other words : no speaking properties are defined .
use of the most suitable speaker that shows all features of a set @-@ up microphone . if you select the settings of the speaker or edit it , elec@@ ts &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker that is originally set to originally set the original properties .
select the method to input the desired intercom properties by clicking on one of the select button .
select the features of the desired microphone station . if this feature does not play any matter , you don &apos;t enter any .
mark this check box , if the property must have priority before other features . you can also set several markings here .
since the language is a critical factor in the release of this issue , it is always necessary to specify this property . if you want to specify the attri@@ bute language , if you might know that a specific application text is sent in another language than that of the working environment .
to use all features in the field of nar@@ rator , which is the most relevant to the below , click on the select button @-@ up , and then apply to the nar@@ rator which corresponds to the following .
in this case , 0 stands for the last text reservation in the qu@@ eu@@ e . you can also specify a order number . ( without a order number the input is 0 is necessary ) .
kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr crash@@ es immediately , when it is started . I compiled my Deb@@ ug support , but I don &apos;t get tra@@ ce@@ ability .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is crashed and has been finished . probably you need to register G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x . if the problem is not solved , possibly a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed . you can try to update G@@ Stre@@ amer or un@@ install .
the audio output via AL@@ SA does not work when I play with another application music . if I hold a text message , fri@@ ert &amp; kt@@ ts ; a message appears , which says : V@@ to open PCM .
on your system , the problem exists that conflicts may occur at AL@@ SA using multiple PCM devices . information for possible solutions can be found on the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ projected .org .
I have installed an additional voice for the Festival from the internet . I installed it and can use it in the festival , but kt@@ m@@ gr shows this voice not .
add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / Vo@@ ices . if this is successful , please send me the other entries . if this is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; if you have found the voice , to the developers .
on the card interface , there is a setting speed . so it works , the program SO@@ X will be installed and via the ambient variable P@@ AT@@ H . some Syn@@ thesis module such as Festival Interactive offers a setting for speed . depending on the chosen voice , this is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the microphone speed will be igno@@ red , if &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; this is clear that the HTML is converted to SS@@ ML . ( see ) or if you are completely cour@@ age@@ ous , change the .x@@ b file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML stra@@ pping filter , and set up the microphone speed .
I do not create that web pages are set up with a female voice . I have set up a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the websites with a male voice .
at Festival 1.@@ 95 , the day S@@ able Gender does not seem to work . so the festival does not make mist@@ akes , the X@@ SL file for converting SS@@ ML into S@@ aber the gender tags . the same also applies to VO@@ ICE tags .
I have added a own character string filter and now I can go back in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no more full @-@ trip or return . on the cart@@ ograph@@ er orders , the order of existing orders will be displayed only from one sentence . what am I doing wrong ?
Inter@@ point characters ( point , cargo sign , ex@@ clamation mark , Com@@ ma and Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ) may not be fil@@ tering . use a filter for set limits for these characters instead .
AL@@ SA ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; sound Architecture ) . AL@@ SA is already installed on most systems with &amp; Linux ; ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ projected .org )
G@@ Stre@@ amer in version 0.@@ 8.7 or later . note : make sure the modules for G@@ Stre@@ amer are registered in front of the use of G@@ Stre@@ amer in &amp; kt@@ ts ; call the command G@@ ST register ( HTTP : / / g@@ stream@@ er.@@ fre@@ ed@@ es@@ op@@ .org )
some users can experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts in the audio output . if your system also counts , you can not start playing music and then start a text if you want to start a text contract and then start another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) .
with state of July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de still does not support any real p@@ auses . if you hold a text message in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current proposition is still present .
the SO@@ X audio program is used for general attitude of speaking speed , but is otherwise un@@ forced . Deb@@ ian users can install SO@@ X with the command ap@@ t @-@ get install SO@@ X . the program is already included on most &amp; Linux ; CDs already included .
have you downloaded &amp; kt@@ ts ; when cam@@ ball ( with t@@ ar packed archive ) , register as usual users and un@@ zip the tar@@ ball in a matching folder . change to this folder and enter the following commands :
in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 is the module &apos;s module ; probably removed or at least only on request .
the following modules for language syn@@ thesizer is created by default . some of them have a running tim@@ acy of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the guidelines of Deb@@ ian Distribution ) . the column configure the setting of the setting shows the configure of setting up the setting .
in / op@@ t / k@@ de@@ 3 installed , this folder is not listed in / op@@ t / k@@ de@@ 3 . if this folder is not listed in the ambient variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you need to specify as option --@@ pre@@ fix = target .

before you can use &amp; kt@@ ops , check first if your language syn@@ thesizer works correctly . follow the instructions that you received with the syn@@ thesizer .
the festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . by many voices , you can adjust volume , microphone speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ts ;
you need to install at least one language . help you find in the manu@@ als which are supplied with festival . would you like to present your web pages , you need to install the ( male British ) Voice Rab _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you need to comp@@ ile an additional module , therefore you need the source code of Festival . the German votes are subject to restrictions .
this voice requires the festival 1.@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in one early development stage . un@@ pack the software in Festival / lib / Vo@@ ices / Russian / . if you enter the Russian voices , you need to enter the vote for the voices of ms@@ u _ ru _ n@@ sh _ di@@ phone . choose a c@@ yr@@ illi@@ c ( 8 @-@ bit@@ - ) coding such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
the festival is normally included in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions . therefore , you are looking for the first to use the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the coding must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding must be set to a 8 bit Cy@@ rus as an example of KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
the festival can be used together with the &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; -@@ syn@@ thesizer will then take the le@@ x@@ ik@@ al analysis and &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; this is generated by the audio output . the &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; program and the &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; -@@ Vot@@ es can be downloaded from
note that &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; generated language from Di@@ ph@@ on files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone . the festival generates these of &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; the necessary di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also produce from German texts Di@@ phone . further information can be found under .
in this case , additional W@@ ra@@ pper Code is added to the festival to use &amp; mb@@ a ; -@@ voices to the voice synthesis . note that the &amp; mb@@ a ; -@@ Stim@@ ulus not in &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; file folder will not be installed , but at the Festival / lib / .
I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of the festival for German &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; votes . necessary to either festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first , install Festival and mb@@ rol@@ a ; then download MS German Festival from
instructions will be found in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file , which you have downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 , you need to re @-@ reset the error correction ) . then add the following lines to the file @-@ festival / lib / sit@@ em@@ it@@ .@@ s@@ cm .

Festival Lite is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff voice syn@@ thesizer which currently supports a limited number of voices and languages . it is a simple voice syn@@ thesizer with even sufficient ab@@ stain@@ ing quality . with &amp; kt@@ ops , you can adjust the sound height as lou@@ der or volume speed by this language syn@@ thesizer .
normally , fl@@ ite is normally included in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions and therefore look for the first to the CDs of your distribution .
H@@ adi@@ fix is a two @-@ stage syn@@ thesizer that works with di@@ ph@@ ons . the program t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o is translated from the sound . language quality is good , but the support is currently limited to few languages . you can vote voice , pitch , microphone speed , and volume via kt@@ ops .
you need at least one German language file from the &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; side and un@@ pack them with un@@ zip into the / usr / local / mb@@ rol@@ a folder .
copy either t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ or@@ c to ~ / .@@ t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ or@@ c or to / etc / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o , here the r@@ c must be removed at the end of the file .
select a voice and set up the path to &amp; mb@@ a ; and t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o correct .
ep@@ ic is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff voice syn@@ thesizer for the Czech and Slovak language . it is a simple voice syn@@ thesizer with even sufficient ab@@ stain@@ ing quality . with &amp; kt@@ ops , you can only adjust the volume with this voice syn@@ thesizer .
start the map speaker , click on the Map card . if the ep@@ ic programs are not included in your P@@ AT@@ H , enter the path to the programs on the cardboard box . in the input fields , you can enter additional parameters for the programs . enter in a &amp; console ; ep@@ s -@@ h or say -@@ h to get more information .
Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff voice syn@@ thesizer , which was written in &amp; Java ; i.e. , you need to install the &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . with &amp; Java ; can &apos;t adjust sound height , volume nor speaking speed .
the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ts ; with any voice syn@@ thesizer , which can be controlled in one &amp; console ; on the command line .
best use a command that writes the language output to a temporary audio file ( wav ) instead of sending the output directly to the audio device
this manual describes the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the network interfaces , enabling networking and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; enables users to manage a series of system and desktop settings via a single , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ control@@ center ;
the &amp; net@@ work@@ conf ; package was developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings like other settings from the &amp; k@@ controller center ; to enable the areas of &amp; net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple surface for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module network settings in &amp; k@@ controller center ; it is possible to run the network settings ( net@@ work@@ conf ; ) module &apos;s network settings ; Internet &amp; network network settings can be launched in &amp; menu .
it is important to understand that &amp; net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers have already been working successfully installed and configured , thus &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device even shows and enables adjustment of network properties .
in most cases drivers for the network hardware and other devices will be installed for the installation hardware and other devices when installing and installed . network appliances added later , the drivers must be up@@ loaded by adjusting the following files , according to the kernel version .
the network settings will be charged if the network settings is selected in the &amp; k@@ controller center ; -@@ Index . starting with the module &apos;s network settings , this is automatically trying to detect the platform on the system .
if the platform can not be recognized , the main selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which the distribution and the release is best . by selecting the setting non @-@ again requests , the definition can be met automatically . during the next start of the network settings this option will automatically set default .
changing the network settings are possible only in system management mode . before , all options are displayed gray , meaning the settings can be viewed , the change of change is not possible . in the system management mode the lower end of the module . it is necessary to enter the password .
in the system management mode , the module &apos;s entire functionality is available . it is divided into three riders :
the rider network interfaces serves to manage the network appliances of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from the rider network interfaces , the following tasks can be carried out :
the settings of displayed network interfaces can be addressed by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking on the button to setup ... in the dialog device .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click on the button to dialog with further possibilities .
with the selection of Autom@@ atically the TCP / IP att@@ itudes are picked up by a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . the D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server will be sending all required TCP / IP information at any system start , therefore no further adjustment is required . in the selection list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system .
with the selection Manu@@ ally no D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be made . in the input field IP address , the desired TCP / IP address is to be specified . in the input field Network mask the sub@@ net@@ mask can be set .
if this setting is marked , initi@@ alized the system interface during bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values given in this dialog will be shown as the characteristics of the device in the device box .
it should be ensured that the IP address is not already used in the network . the input of an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console ; you can determine if the address is already in use . in doubt the network administrators should be asked .
network devices can be switched off or switched off or switched off . switching of an switched network device is performed by selecting from the list and click interface ....
network tools can be switched off or switched off or switched off . switching of an activated network device is done by selecting from the list and click interface ....
set the IP address of the host in local sub@@ net , which convey@@ s physical connection to remote networks , and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with machines in other sub @-@ networks .
if the computer is connected more than a network interface , the interface is connected to the net in which the gateway computer is set to be selected .
a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain indication by the corresponding IP address . if the computer ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org lists the name of this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3.4@@ 5,@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the calcul@@ ator for the name resolution part of the e@@ quest@@ rian name resolution allows easy administration of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed _ DNS entries in the list with buttons or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with buttons or down in priority .
clicking on the button el ... from the group calcul@@ ator to name the name resolution can be added a DNS server . it will add the new name server name to the name of the name server .
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution select one entry and then click on the button Edit .... It is displayed by the dialog button .
the List of nam@@ ing computers describes host name @-@ to @-@ IP address references to the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily on bo@@ oting , if no DNS server is available . in small , closed networks can replace it DNS server .
normally , the list of nam@@ efully users contains some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv6 addresses support this still in the test version of IP is to replace 4 in the future .
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known host computer and click add .... The dialogue New also will be displayed .
to enter the name of the known host and click the button of adding . if the well @-@ known calcul@@ ator has several alias names , de button add several times and enter the other alias names .
select an entry of a well @-@ known host from the list and select Edit .... The dialog for the computer is displayed .
it can be performed using the following tasks , then with clicking from OK , the list of static hosts will be updated .
the settings made in the module settings are not immediately ready to activate the system . in order to activate the changes , the following command needs to be set .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm packages ) , it is enough to install if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users . it &apos;s just download the rpm package and it is easy to install with rpm as follows :
alternatively a tool can be used with graphical surface like a package or the installation tool of its distribution .
for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; not , but additionally , the development processes with libraries and other things are required .
this will only be experienced users . however , it is not difficult to comp@@ ile &amp; work@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should aff@@ ord this .
in the first section of this chapter , major information on basic network technology will be discussed in the second , all by &amp; net@@ work@@ conf ; changed configuration files .
this area can &apos;t replace more information on IP networks . in this app@@ endix only basic information on the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network is convey@@ ed .
at present IP networks with TCP / IP version 4 ( IPv4 ) has never been operated . from IPv6 , it is expected to continue in the near future . this description is therefore concentrated on the widespread IPv4 .
one of the most important information is the knowledge that IP address is to assign to a network interface . in a strange network , the network administrators is the contact , which can be configured a valid IP address , or if available , D@@ H@@ CP can not be selected in any case !
when selecting a own small ( home ) network , the IP address is chosen from a specially designed area to avoid IP address bil@@ let with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded to the internet , therefore its any use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be made possible by adjusting a g@@ at@@ ew@@ ays .
for smaller networks , addresses are mostly used in the areas of 192.168.@@ 1.1 through 192.168.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the power mask is set to 255.@@ 255.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all machines are connected in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special items , 0.0@@ eg ; .0.0 and 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the custom computer ) . the default route is needed for the IP address .
the 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 network address is reserved for the IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 is assigned to its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works as a closed circle .
in this part , the configuration files that are affected by &amp; net@@ work@@ conf ; and where they are stored in different distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes changed with DSL connections , so it would not be surprised when in case of active DSL connections , another content can be found there .
for &amp; SuSE ; it is known that this file is s@@ orting out through the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config file . another stand can be considered as expected .

&amp; k@@ dat ; is a back@@ pack@@ er program for tape drives on the basis of t@@ ar . it offers the opportunity to create multiple archives on a tape , the development of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ t@@ ar for quick , selective out@@ pack . the second goal was to answer a question that asked my wife : how much longer lasts it when you sec@@ ures it ?
before a band can be used , it must be selected by &amp; k@@ dat ; that can be done on three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; trained the band and read the st@@ ressing of the tape . recogn@@ ise &amp; k@@ dat ; the preview on the tape you will be asked if the bond is being format@@ ted .
det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; the preview , looking for the matching index on your record . can &apos;t be found if the tape index is to be created .
everything goes smooth , changes the icon to the tape drive to indicate that the band has been mounted . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the content of the tape can now be searched through the entry into the tape .
before removing the belt , you must first need to be resolved . there are three methods to do this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; gives a modification of the symbol for the tape that the binding for the tape has been solved and shows a corresponding error in the status bar . the band can now be cast out without any danger .
before a band of &amp; k@@ dat may be used , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat ;
a band@@ age must be format@@ ted before you will need to be used to save data . if your tape drive does not need to be format@@ ted before you need to be format@@ ted before using the band of &amp; k@@ dat ; this process can usually be format@@ ted before using the tape drive , D@@ AT drives on the other hand .
after entering the band name and the capacity goes on &amp; k@@ dat ; with the form@@ att@@ ing of the tape . all data on the tape can be lost automatically ! after the form@@ att@@ ing process the band is automatically integrated and is ready for use .
before you encounter the backup process , you need to choose to make sure that you need to make sure that it may be done in three ways :
select a file or folder to a local file tree . it will only be saved in this file or folder .
select a secure profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are secured .
select files in the local file tree with a bun@@ ch . only the selected files and / or sub @-@ folders are secured .
click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and select in the Menu ...
as soon as the backup was initiated , the dialog opens up for backup . in this dialog you can even check the selected files and change the settings for backup .
if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog appears to backup . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives for the drive . it is checked only to select the selected file or folders .
select the files in one of the files named for the band with a bun@@ ch . only the selected files and / or sub @-@ folders are checked .
click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry ...
once the test procedure has started , the dialog appears for review . in this dialog you can check out your selection and change the work folder for review .
if you have confirmed the settings for the review , the dialog appears check . this dialog shows the progress of the test process as well as the throughput and remaining time .
before you can slide the restore , the files that are supposed to be recovered . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder located in one of the archives created for the tape drive . it will only restore the selected file or sub @-@ folders .
select the required files from one of the archives with a bun@@ ch . only the selected files and / or sub @-@ folders will be restored .
click with the right mouse button on a file or folder in one of the archives and select in the menu Rest@@ ore ....
once the recovery process has started , the dialog appears for re@@ build . in this dialog you can check out your selection and change the work folder for restoration .
if you have confirmed the settings for restoration , the dialog appears to restore progress . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the throughput and remaining time .
sometimes it is necessary to create the band inde@@ x@@ file using the tape content . this process involves all existing In@@ dex@@ files for this band . you can re@@ build the index to two types of tape :
this is a secure profile with the straight marked files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a secure profile :
the current working folder where backup is to be carried out . list of the files being updated automatically according to the chosen work folder .
for all the folders listed under backup files , only the files are stored on the same file system , such as the folder . file , which are located on other file systems , can be set separately on backup files . each entry will be viewed from t@@ ar independent of the other .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have been changed since the last incre@@ mental backup file , a snap@@ shot file is secured . only the files have been secured since ever since .
the name of the file , which is used to determine the changes since the last in@@ incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snap@@ shot file before the call of t@@ ar . this causes that all files will be secured and created a new snap@@ shot file for the next backup .
the functionality of buttons files are log@@ ged ; and lt ; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
the settings can be set via the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the menu settings . the following settings can be made :
the full path to the device file for the tape drive ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding variant of the tape .
if this setting is active , transm@@ its &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape can be connected to the drive . when some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be carried out .
if the option is enabled , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; it may not work on tape drives . possibly , this setting does not work with all band drives .
if the option is switched on , when loos@@ ening the integration of &amp; k@@ dat , the band is automatically cast out ; use this option for floppy stre@@ aks .
if the option is enabled , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; not all drives support variable block@@ sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you need &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the log size for your belt drive .
when &amp; k@@ dat ; a band is format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of tape . this file should only prove a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file is composed as follows :
( N byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is host@@ name : seconds , whereby computer name is the full name of the system , on which the band has been format@@ ted on which the band has now passed since the time has been format@@ ted since the ep@@ och .
the band ID is used to find a file named $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file using the same name .
the remaining files on the tape are pure t@@ ar archives that can be directly connected with &amp; GNU ; - t@@ ar . even other t@@ ar versions should work , as long as it is not for incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a backup association . this symbol is only active when a band is mounted .
&amp; ks@@ log@@ log - is a &amp; k@@ de ; the program is suitable for un@@ experienced users who can not know where you can receive information on your system or where the system allows the different protocol @-@ files . in addition , the system enables quick access to informations about problems that appear on their server .
&amp; ks@@ ystem log ; helps users to understand what your computer is in the background . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who can not know where you can receive information on your system or where system releases the different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; ks@@ ystem log ; experienced users for quick access to informations about problems that appear on their server . &amp; ks@@ ystem log ; therefore , some extended functions can be filtered and evaluated using the protocol files of certain programs .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , the system log log . a range of useful features include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other features are also included in addition , and are explained in the other chapters of this manual .
as you see in the following screen picture shows &amp; ks@@ ystem log ; features available , with the help of the individual protocol lines of a protocol file , can easily fil@@ tering and sort the individual options for s@@ orting and filters will be shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after launching the system log log , first the main protocol @-@ file system - the system protocol - will not be displayed , and it opens up instead of its a small news window , so you did not run with system administrator right . the protocol files can usually run under Linux normally in the folder / var / log , for the normal user no just@@ ification for reading .
you can also use the filter bar to filter according to a limited range of crit@@ erion or according to the configured string . in the default setting , the selection box will be displayed next to the selected filter . in default , a protocol line will be displayed only if in one of the columns the strings of the filter search term is included .
you can also select another entry to this site . select the strings of the filter search term will then only select the entries in the same column . select an example in the filter bar called the name of a process , thus shows &amp; ks@@ ystem log ; all protocol lines , which were sent or produced by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines . protocol @-@ lines of level error are displayed with a remarkable colour as a protocol @-@ lines of level indication . the background images of protocol @-@ lines can be switched off .
if you want to display only certain process ( e.g. in the system protocol or in cr@@ on protocol ) , so you can use the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process , for example , if you want to examine the output of a specific command , such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case you will use the filter bar .
furthermore , you can jump the option to new lines in the context menu of the main window , to show up all new protocol lines .
&amp; ks@@ log@@ log - allows you to use multiple protocol files into separate sub@@ windows . to use this function , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage . as soon as you have selected a window , select a protocol to display in the menu .
&amp; ks@@ ystem log ; has its own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / ks@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ sof@@ tw@@ are@@ .@@ or@@ .@@ D@@ ort you will find more current information about the sources of sources &amp; ks@@ ystem log ;
&amp; ks@@ ystem log ; can also be found in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : ks@@ ystem log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; system V In@@ it Editor , rather well known ( and the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ;
the system V In@@ it develops quickly to the standard for control of program start in the world &amp; Linux ; therefore , because it is easier to use , more powerful and even more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it .
I will not go further on historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it ) : - ) .
the in@@ ite bin@@ aries under / s@@ am and not under / etc . this is therefore important because perhaps someone could try to set a machine on system V in@@ it , without creating a new installation and new format . that &apos;s why you need to be sure that the old in@@ it was removed from there , if there was there one .
the SY@@ SV In@@ it also distingu@@ ishes itself from the BSD in@@ it that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are instead directly in / etc . this folder means r@@ c.@@ d , you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a complete set of scripts . basically you will need to launch a script for any system service , you want to start the system or change to another run@@ level . system services include such things as network , NFS , &amp; H@@ mail ; , ht@@ t@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is only once started . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should not lie down on / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems possess this file even if there is not much use for this . you can also want to put a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a bit if you want to do something with the serial port .
the kernel is searching for different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first that he finds .
the default run@@ level is listed in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see a line like the following :
at this point you can take a look into the second column and probably determine that the pre @-@ installed run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change the default changes , then you can fix it , then you &apos;ll fix it by re@@ boot the system and run the following :
but how does it start now all the correct scripts ? if you enter -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you will probably see something like the following :
you will notice that in this folder don &apos;t have the right files . instead , each entry here is a link to one of scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
how to start and stops in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each scripts are so written that it is a argument like start and stop . you can start this scripts actually off by hand on the command line :
this would hold the ht@@ t@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the K contains , the script will be called with the argument . if it includes a S , the script will be called using the argument .
some people require a simple way to create machines for many purposes . I could have a server @-@ level , that can run only ht@@ t@@ p@@ d , network &amp; etc ; , network &amp; etc ; , network &amp; etc ; , network &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc ; starts .
here you can learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; you should not be very difficult because the program was designed so user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another poin@@ ter , is simple to say no tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the area of availability system services to one of the six run@@ level to launch it on this level ( or stop at ) .
you can also move the scripts between Run@@ es or the position within one level by moving it differently . this is the entry of its original run@@ level ( or its position ) . this is done not only if they draw an entry from the area of availability system services .
note : entries will be post@@ pon@@ ed if you select it in a new area . to select it only to a new run@@ level , you need to select copying from the menu menu or from the context menu -- even then , if the same entry has already existed in the target range of action .
the s@@ orting @-@ number of a single entry can be sometimes not calculated . in such a case you need to edit the s@@ orting numbers in the environment before you can try again to insert the system service .
note : currently there is no way to restore entries that were thrown into the paper basket . be careful therefore .
you can use the tab button to activate the different operating ranges ( Available system services , run@@ level 1 start , run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to meet a selection above or below the previous one .
to move one entry into another round @-@ level , move it with cutting into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it into the desired round level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to change the input number or the name of a single entry , press the input button to switch between different fields . close the dialog by clicking on the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to refuse the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the menu file require a confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pre@@ ferences will be taken if they are available . otherwise they will be recovered by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the default settings are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard lap@@ tops , and now the machine starts constantly . what can I do ?
give the L@@ ILO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input key to start in single @-@ use mode . then edit the / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; available at run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using &amp; SuSE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution .
the type , as system services started in these distri@@ butions , is simplified the configuration for the propri@@ etary distribution programs of this distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not comply with the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an expansion of the program for this approach .
if you are using a different distribution : please check whether all configuration files are required ( and also if they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or ht@@ t@@ p@@ d ) is simply without message when their configuration files are not present or wrong .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use another distribution please send me information about the run@@ level , so that this manual can be added to this manual .
this documentation is based on &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can centrally manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is enough to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ;
after you have made changes , you have to save them . either use the corresponding icon of tool@@ bar or the entry Save in the menu .
&amp; user ; is a simple application . the main window is made of two cart@@ ons , the user and user master leaderboard . click on the select user or the desired group with a double click on the entry . it appears the dialog user or group features .
some card cards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings . only if you can upgrade your system settings , you will be able to make individual settings . additional card cards appear , if shadow pass@@ words , or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes are installed .
the password management board appears , if shadow -@@ pass@@ words , or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as in BSD -@@ Uni@@ xes are installed .
this card chart will only be activated and initi@@ alized if for at least an integrated fil@@ esystem ( Qu@@ ota ) and initi@@ alized ( recogni@@ z@@ able at the file gen@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ as group on the file system ) . here you can change parameters for each user parameter , i.e. the restricted figures in KB are :
these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current file system will be selected with the help of the field file system .
the board ticket informs about the group of the selected user . the standard group , to which the user belongs , you can find in the field of prim@@ itive group . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by selecting this in the large field .
the dialog for Group features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or a group , choose from the menu user or group or click on the matching add @-@ button of the tool@@ bar . edit or delete the selected user or the selected group .
with this module , you can add the L@@ ILO Bo@@ ats to add the boot password , remove and change the time to boats from the standard operating system , remove , change operating systems , change , change and more .
