<seg id="151">Maybe you will be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can be found quickly over your location. if you're on the same place. if you want to organize enough photos, then you will use sub-folders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; use. export is then a folder for images that can print or publish on a web site.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements such as versioning photos, archiving, working processes, constant supply of pictures to different themes and a large number of all. within 10 years 95% archives and 5% work files will not want to reorganise your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files are fit together? the separation of file types makes the stack processing easier. split new of old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies the backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend to save the metadata option to activate. this is sure that excuse and IPTC data can be written in the file. if you forget it, then you can save the metadata from the database in the files by select the corresponding items in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change what? add & digicame; them a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work starts because you should select every photo sample, labelling and an evaluation. of course you can select all images that you want to select the same attribute and start the value. this makes sense when you can focus on the best photos on the best photos.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let us now be hot, keywords, keyword or categories as well as in other programs. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you importing cataloged images from another source with embedded keywords, then add & digiplug; automatically add the tree to the correct place. that surrounds the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by using a sub-tree to another. the changed stitutes will be prosecuted by & digious; updated while there is sub-trees.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphics shows how different metadata cutting themselves. this is a very rough representation because each block of metadata exists from many sections. filenames and calendar data are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the stitch - the next section refers to labels or comments, the third important tool to catalogate your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">Most of them don't want to watch your photos simply, you want to share them with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. they are certainly interested in your photos.</seg>
<seg id="163">Check out this panorama. from the distance is not even a nice beach panorama. if you look closer, then start to see some details, people, space.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I tell you these of the landing area of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after the landing. Wow! one starts to dream, memories, the historical period is again present, you may perhaps hear your perception of this panorama.</seg>
<seg id="165">For other those who consider your photos are the title possibly more important than the picture itself to create a story. remember that the key is to transfer Him to help Him to understand about the motive you have to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It's okay if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only with a labelling for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digiplug; you can also store a lot of text in an internationalised alphabet (UTF-8), then you can use it for a selection of images at the same time. if you have to export your images in Web galleries, then you will need to tell you the story for a second time.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times before GPS? when you had to find a different city without navigation system? was it not a boring planet in front of googleEarth? well, because with pictures the train departs of the spatial presentation now already with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities can use the geolocalisation. I'm sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually repeat your travels with geographical data. you can also export the photos at the recording location. you can also view the photos at the recording location. you can also export the photos to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with googleMaps viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and denotes the practice of copyrights to remove restrictions on distribution and change of copies. the same freedoms also apply to all amended versions, so also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you what information is provided in the setup page of & digicame; as information can be deposited:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for replacement and author): this field should add your name, or the name of the person who has created the photo. if it is not desired to protect the name of photographers, then the name of a company or organisation may not be changed. according to this value, it should not be changed once again. this field does not support semi-Semiconolons as a separator.</seg>
<seg id="173">Autonomy (synonymous with the author): associated with the author. this field contains the work drawing of photographers. examples of this field can be the title as: employee photographer, free work photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a memo to the authorization field, this is also being filled out.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for providers): use the provider to identify the photo. if the photographer is working for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organisations can be listed here if the image is a stock photo, then the image will offer the image here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright action, although they do not provide protection against misuse. each of which is a little more than base-party metadata, delete or change. the solution for this problem are digital watermarks. for individuals, this protection is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and half professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique in each picture. & digiplug; in the near future, a module for stack processing is available.</seg>
<seg id="177">Subjects: record error, record loss, power switch, ECC, transmission error, ageing of storage media, restoring, redundancy, life time, temperature, data size, widespread superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire. those kind of losses are the same that you can also pass in traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section it is about problems with the so-called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll Ontrack, the largest data recovery company in the world, has some interesting statistics which has a loss of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To combat the problem of CDs / DVDs to fight these pre-cautious experience, you can also live longer than a few years. of course you can also receive CDs and DVDs in archive quality. there are offers of gold coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for itself. if you believe it is in your discretion.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD Disks can be unreadable, but you can use this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices. the best DVD capture devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest ones, but you write much reliable. it rotates the correct select.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very vulnerable for mistakes, even if you are just written. therefore, they use a control mechanism to protect themselves. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and control sums. despite this massive protection it causes them through chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs there is a useful program called IsoBuster through Windows and Linux; but is not available for Macs. there is also similar applications that damaged data from damaged disks, hard disks, Flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray Disks seem to store the format war against the HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB. all about CDs and DVDs was naturally also true for the Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good start-to-quality media in a no proprietary format. also read the media with a description, date & author number and afterwards protected in a clean, dark dry and on animals protected site. do not forget to copy the data on the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware and software that can read this media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Diskmanufacturer retain your statistics for themselves. their manufacturers guarantees a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives: dismissing</seg>
<seg id="187">In brief, Disks hold fast when you are operated in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. For lower temperature applications, SMART can't notice these errors. some of SMART provided errors do not cancel the impending failure. these are particular reading and reiteration count. the expected lifetime of life is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete losses due to overvoltage. of course you can also have data loss due to a power loss before you have secured the files, but these losses may normally produce without great problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electric devices are not far too far, this anomalies may take effect on devices with computer chips and high-speed processes. these anomalies may cause serious data loss, hardcopy age, destroyed motherboards and other defects. protect themselves from inevitable to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most widespread protection against power points is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs a portion of energy heat absorbs and the rest. it is usually in the form of a plug-in strip, but remember that any connector bar also contains an overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, then you should make sure that he offers the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also make sure that it protects protection against flash, and thus protects the correctly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since there is an overvoltage of each cable to your computer, you should also make sure that all the peripherals can be connected to your system. some manufacturers provide overvoltage support and also include a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connectivity options for coaxial cable of the cable modems and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, then you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are designed specifically for notebooks, therefore also very small and you also contain the protection for the modem. so you are ideal for traveling.</seg>
<seg id="194">While overvoltage protection your system is used before smaller fluctuations in the power lines it will not really help you. even a failure of a few seconds can result in the loss of adverse data. it may be sensible in a interruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protection against overvoltage, these devices allow you to save up to the power. some models allow you even further to work up to the current. if you purchase a USV, you should be sure that they are the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the enclosed software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its safety with the costs to avoid this. a high-quality overvoltage protection can get up to & euro; 20. this is only a small price difference if you're thinking about how well your calculator is thus protecting. at the end you should always think all cable to drive you into the holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration, you can use this as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use this as the backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offer that allows you to save any quantities of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">As compared to the hard drives, they are very expensive - 40 GB cost & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollar; 500. in addition, you need to send data about the comparatively long-term Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only a solution against a local data loss of the most important pictures. this is not a bad solution, but there is no general backup solution. therefore it is too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are available on photos. their free memory is limited to 1 GB. the professional version offers you more at your disposal, in case of Flickr dramatic more. for $25 per year you get unlimited memory, which should be reviewed in reality.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of the data backup, the web solutions are very secure. transmission errors will be automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and with the large companies are included in the offer a backup and a distribution memory. thus they are desasterably.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in calculator. all transmissions are ansusceptible to transmission errors. the filesystem and btrfs represent at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that no one has occurred when a transmission error occurred, not if this occurred in your hardware. all these disruptions remain undiscovered until you should have no protection. no one seems to have thought about it. nobody seems to have thought about it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much more secure data away as being in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are a further source of transmission losses, as they generate interferences within the data stream. with normal file systems this error remains unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are currently affected by transfers problems you should look into the future. already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS by Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates that can handle and highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it is soon available for & Linux; and Windows available. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has launched an own initiative with its btrfs system. this is still in alpha status. it uses the same protection mechanisms that is used and is also available for & Linux; but it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate that these two factors are responsible for 86% of data loss at notebook and 46% at the workplace systems. if notebooks the percentage of thieves is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less widespread than the most posten. it leads to a lower damage, as such as steels or reinstallations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users know only very few viruses and under Linux; there has been no longer been sighted.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less susceptible to data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to find the common file systems. you can find a very good English article here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden interruption during surgery is higher and an undefined status is avoided. if a file was not completely saved before the problem was lost, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the largest threat to digital data: wrong, theft and human error are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 stops of fundamental physical limits. this is that while technology develops further, there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and robotic risks for all kinds of light sensors are no longer removed from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards the 10 megapixels sensors. even though this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result rather deteriorates. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 Megapixel. for higher resolutions, you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard disk will get you today for 100 & euro; so you do not get any other data loss for data loss. so, you save your data often according to a plan and test this backup before you make any more dangerous like the reinstallation of your operating system, the exchange of plates or the size change of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you're assuming daily your fuses on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a flash one strikes you luck when the drive was not connected to the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster suggests locally and destroys a lot. do not forget aircraft accident: fire, water, electricity, children, and steels are dangerous enough for your data. they usually affect an entire room or entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, disintegration always means a non-local storage. bring your backups up the stairs into the neighboring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of the physical separation: as shown above is a common reason for a data loss despite backup the panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files are to be secured. it is a momentary lapse without historiography and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential securing: the backup of files have been changed since the last complete backup. creates a complete snapshot at two time points: the complete backup and the last differentiation.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental securing: a backup of the files have been changed since the last backup. it allows the original status to restore the original status at any time. this backup comes to a versioning system at the next time with the exception that it is only absent and not continuously.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful small tool that can easily configure your machines. in contrast to script-controlled FTP sessions, or other types of file transferring scripts, only the difference of files that have been really changed. this happens and if you want to increase safety through ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Secure important pictures directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or another optically medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach will allow you plenty of time to discover and restore losses. at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly surcharge for at least one month and a moment for each month. any further expansion should be done manually after which you have done a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, stored in the picture file stored IPTC information, editor, memory, scalability, media, relocate images and metadata, copy the images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">To survive valuable pictures the next 40 years, that is about the period in which you really interested in you are you interested in your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future is unpredictable because of your nature, everything is said to consider and re-evaluate while the time flies. unfortunately, there is no other way to ask yourself as the current system backwards. the less variants you have used in the past, the more easier is to evaluate the questions about the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered using the explanations in this document. use and change to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is now available for everyone. if you have an old system, you will keep it for reading your images, then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for a later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand the Council is quite simple: every time when you change your computer architecture, your memory and secure file format, you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard. stay at open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialized print for the possibility to change a system in its size. this is actually enlarged.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's go out that you have planning the scalability with entered and use the area you will increase to a dedicated disk or partition. in * nix systems such as & Linux, you can copy this area and rely on a new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check the dmesg command if your new record is detected by the system, but do not depend on it.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollar; dd if = / dev / SDC # Source is / dev / SDC / sdc1 0 & lt; Size of the plate in MBgt; # works with ext2,3, FAT16, 32 and ReiserFS & dollar; resize2fs / dev / SM / 1 # change the size of ReiserFS if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if any time no software is able to read, then you can create these themselves. this task is easier from year to year easier.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary format that disappears slowly from the market. you should not use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG was designed to replace as an open source standard, but it can save much more. it is reliable, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. PNG may have a lot of administration information, but not as many as TIFF needs and a slow compression ratio. this format we would like to save you to save your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widespread as image format. TIFF can be saved in uncompressed form or in a container with a lossless compression algorithm. however, it is very large files. with some cameras you can customize your images in this format. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital negatives file format is a licensed and open-screen format that has been developed by Adobe Systems. it is based on TIFF / EP format and is obliged to use metadata. it is now available to use metadata. a handful camera manufacturer makes DNG available now and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon also sometime.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is possibly one of the reasons why, in 2001, Adobe uses its XML-based XMP technology, to replace the & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a blend of XML and RDF. the file information is allowed with the expansion & quot; .xmpquot; is stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer an original of your photo, mostly in the blank format. however, the metadata can be purchased separately from the image file and how it is indicated above, the raw format is split. therefore, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put everything here together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization that supports a wide range of usage purposes and business models. to the activities of DCMI communities, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and explanatory efforts to achieve an extensive acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import pictures from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long the images are on the camera dium, you can use it as temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save it in your raw repository. this function is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="246">For an hostile processing, you can use external programs. if you want to edit the pictures again with & digiplug; then you should add the metadata again. these were cut off using the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the machined images for the copyright with a digital watermark. export them only in WebGalleries, encode in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digiplug; in the section of adding photos to an album you can also add a description as you can already have on your hard drive, but the camera interface makes you many advanced settings for importing images to your Albendatenbank.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digiplug; connect these to the computer, turn off the camera to the display mode and switch it. another description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera, it tries to connect to your camera. if the connection is made, a distance indicator at the bottom end and the images of all photos on the camera will be displayed. if this is the case, the filenames and a symbol of file order is displayed for each file, photos, movies, music, etc on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you can download the photos on your computer, you may need to see the camera information about any entry. with the page features and metadata from the camera-interface, you can see the properties of a single entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows file properties and the camera information that are internally saved from the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded on your computer. note that some digital cameras are not available to all information.</seg>
<seg id="253">The rider metadata shows the internal metadata such as EXIF, manufacturer attaching, GPS etc. this information is the same as with the metadata sidebar from the main window of & digiplug; or the image processing. note that these metadata are not available in some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is click to download and then download all photos from their camera to a single album in & digiplug;. when downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend you to download if the pictures are saved in an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you don't want to download all photos, you can only select the desired option from & kde; select the selected button and then select the selected button. the reset selection can be downloaded as long as you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this option is a new option available. these pictures have not been downloaded from & digiplug; downloaded. in this case, the new pictures are selected with a star in preview window. if you select this option, only the new pictures are downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you can download all of the buttons or select the selected album, a dialog appears that you can select the target album in which the photos are stored. details on folder records can be found in the section My albums. then choose the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you selected the target album, press OK, and & digiplug; you can download the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">As soon as you downloaded the desired photos, you can erase them from the camera by removing the Delete button. if you want to delete all your button, you'll need to select it at first and delete the delete selection.</seg>
<seg id="260">Note that there is no way to restore photos that you have been deleted from the camera. you should not check if the photos are successfully deleted from the camera. if you want to delete the camera you want to erase them. if you want to erase the camera of camera, you should make it much faster than that.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as filenames for photos often not especially meaningful names. this can result in double file names, if you can upload photos of different ascents into the same album, so it can be sensible, the date and time to integrate the image into the filenames.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you can find options for turning and mirrors of the picture and date based undercarriage. if you use this latter option, a folder will be created per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transfer will open three more options that are done before the photos stored on the plate. if you select this, the corresponding entries from the EXIF data will be copied to the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct date & time for all downloaded pictures.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you wish to use a different format format as standard format, you can use the prefix photo -% Y-% m-% H:% M:% S. switch to this option date & time. for further adjustments you should read the help of the command strftime.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you are using the camera file names, you have the option to change filenames in lowercase or if you prefer to download this file names.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, the & digiplug; for a photo, will be displayed below the name, which is stored in the preview. your settings for renaming will be saved and automatically used when you open the camera window.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digiplug; can use all information on the orientation of the camera to run a automatic rotation during the shutdown. do not all the cameras are ready. in the section sidebar metadata you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is normally switched on, and if your camera does not supply this information, you can't use & digiplug; the photo in the original orientation. if you want to turn off the automatic rotation, use the button and select the automatic rotation at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">When your camera information is made available, you can use & digiplug; this sublime is based on the picture data. all images with the same date will be loaded into the same sub-album. not all cameras provide you to read what information can be embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is normally switched off and in this case saves & digiplug; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this option, use this button and select the file-based undercarriage at the bottom end of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to download photos from their calculator to download is the button. then, in which you can select the files you want to be uploaded. you can also select more than a file with the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, ask & digicame; you where the images should be loaded high. select the folder selection dialog for the camera. choose the desired folder and press OK to start uploading. the images are not deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as general concept in this document. thus, a position is meant to be displayed in longitude and latitude and which can be displayed on a map. identifying the data can be performed from the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photography, it is interesting to create a picture with a precise geographic location. not everyone uses a plane in order to enhancing a field by automatic recording of GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you forgot later, where exactly the photo was made, you can select the area that shows the area. if you want to select a postcard to another & digiplug; users want to document the place of the photos, or just want to document this aspect, it is well the position data of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how to come the GPS data into the image? at first you should know that exiv2 lots of GPS data fields, such as the data into these fields, so there are at least three ways to reach this. directly with the right hardware, via a reprocessing of GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for the geographic mapping (manual) and last about manual input of well-known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera that has integrated GPS unit. but there is a couple that works with GPS receivers. either as a map module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>

<seg id="279">The download of GPS data from one device can be made with gpsman or gpsbabel. you need to save these data in the GPX format, as it is the only format that is supported by the module to geographic mapping.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are different programs for & Windows; and Mac OS, which can extract and correlated data from images and from GPS. on the following page you can make the same under & Linux; gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other data, then you can use this script that works with the ExifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the signs to be created, e.g. by maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com shows no European street types. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, all the navigation data for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digiplug; tries to change the same settings as possible. there are many settings that you should change the behaviour of & digiplug; you need to choose between these settings. you can switch between these settings. you can switch between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left.</seg>
<seg id="284">You can select this action to preview or start image processing. if you want the default behavior of & digiplug; fixed if you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains as shown below, the Standardidacy and technical data. these data will be selected automatically into the appropriate IPTC data fields, if the option is selected for download from the camera code. also on a database synchronisation, these data are written into the IPTC fields.</seg>
<seg id="286">Autortitel is a synonym for disco parts: this field should contain the professional name of the photographer. these can be drawings such as a photographer photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a closer description to the author, this also has to be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Editor is a synonym for providers: use this field to use the photo. this is not the author, if this organisations should be entered here as such as Reuters or Associated Press; and if the image is a stock photo, then the group or agency must be shown here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data into the corresponding IPTC rim. this ensures that the metadata are permanently contained in the picture and not only arrived in the database of & digi. these metadata are also available and can be imported into & digious; they are imported without losing.</seg>
<seg id="289">Image certificates like embedded labels (JFIF) in JPEG pictures store: this synchronizes the comments that you can read to your photos, with the images that can be read from other images. attention: for pictures, which include files, these can be viewed by the & digiplug.</seg>
<seg id="290">The page settings includes all options for the information that appear when the mouse pointer in the main window over a file. depending on the selected option, this information is displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digicame; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to determine which file types & digicame; Albumfolder that has no such expansions is added, from & digicame; ignored.</seg>
<seg id="292">The default settings can be returned once again by pressing the button on the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the luminance & digiplug; can be set on this page on the default values. however, some pictures have different sizes and the synchronous mode is then not available. if you have one more images and the synchronous mode, you should only use quick computers. if you have one, then you can obtain better acceptance results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, the image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select it here. you can switch toolbar if you use the image processing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Overexposed and exposed areas of a picture can be marked with darker or brighter color in the picture. these colors are specified here. in the image processing, this picture mode can be switched on and off with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma Subsampling it is meant that the images can be encoded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in the colour information. please read this article in Wikipedia for the night statement.</seg>
<seg id="297">With adjustment PNG compression, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not require image quality because PNG requires a loss free algorithm. if you have a quick calculator, you can set this value to a high compression. thereby, 1: a low and 9 a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the TIFF TIFF you can compress the deflate algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of TIFF images. it has no influence on image quality because the deflate algorithm is freely working.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the adjustment-free JPEG 2000 files you can save loss. even if you have posted the loss of quality and file size, the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than at normal JPEG. when this paragraph was written, metadata was not yet supported but was found in planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In the earlier versions of & digicame; the image processing was only a picture viewer for photos. currently, it has evolved very quickly to a tool to manipulating your photos. with this dialog, you can change the settings of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default timeout is that all green pixels are equal to ultraviolet light. if you use this option, solve this problem with a minimum loss of details. this option sets the image a bit soft, eliminates the 2x2 grid pattern with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white off of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, automatic colour balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white paper is not set. default it is a fixed color balance that was photographed on a white card which was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. the use of the second sensors has the effect that they are exposed in four steps more details in top lights. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the peak light, so the parts of your camera that are plugged in due to the inability of your camera the top white in the settings. use the setting colors generated some unusual results, as it shows the cutting in various roses. last you can try to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from top lights.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general is not so quickly saturation like green and red. & dcraw try to reconstruct the missing green and red shareholdings from the still not saturated blue pixels. of course this is a question, how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the option you select the option to set a level. here is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adjusted individually for each picture.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the luminance value after your taste. you must probably set him somewhat higher than the default 1. this may also be made later in the picture options of & digicame; - image processing is also recommended to keep the time for Demosaicing small, you should commit conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from colour-filtered image sensor, which have many cameras and have a matrix-coloured pixel. this algorithm is also known as CFA-interpolation or color structure.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digiplug; and Dcraw are available to you three alternatives: Bilinear, VNG interpolation and AHD interpolation. after some tests, it was produced as if AHD Interpolation (variable number from gradient) was created. however, it creates color line acts on edges. Bilinear is interesting if you're looking for a quick solution using an acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the colour of your lentils you can set the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for a color correction, as you will be carried out during the shell conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the colour information and gives instructions as these should be given. there are also LCMS and & digiarrived; information like the color information from an color space to translate into the others the colors are as accurately as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Questions if a picture is opened in image processing / color management module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color profile folder Soccupy here the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC / or / home / .Color / ICC, where you can save all your profiles. & digicame; investigated this folder then during the start.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of the ICC-Profile you have here the option & quot; default sources; for your profile to deposit. everything can change when opening the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color-statement view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argl. here, only your pictures are not administered to the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should be used to fit the camera manufacturers and model that do not use. there are some, such as Canon which does not contain color mapping or gammacorrection. currently, dcraw Gamma is not included for conversions at 16 bit depth. this means that you have to perform the color mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are further options like the Soft-Proof-profile, with which you can print, as your printer may print a smaller color range than your camera and some colors are therefore very saturated. this could manually adjust instead of itself on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it is pretty obvious that colour profile with them woke for them. unfortunately, there is not a table of cameras and profiles can fit together here. this response is naturally unofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon Profile Extension allows the style to detect the style: F for a precise style, L for landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portrait and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; Image plugin interface. it is an interface supported by a series of & kde; images and image processing is supported; many modules support, which have been written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you will see a list of available modules. select the modules that you want to use, and these modules will be loaded from & digi. these modules appear as new entries in the main window of the main window and in addition you will also find some examples in the context menu of the preferences.</seg>
<seg id="323">Memorandum for tasks that are carried out by modules can be set up in the menu under settings.</seg>
<seg id="324">For more information (in English) about KIPI-modules you can get via the KIPI project via http: / / www.kipi-plugin .org or in the handbooks of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the slide should be easy to understand. the upper knob adjusts the time between the image inputs, usually are 4-5 seconds well. the other check boxes switch the metadata, or that ends at the bottom end of the pictures during the ad.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera features show on the left side a list of all the camera supported cameras. if you want to use it, make sure that the camera is correctly connected, enabled and in image display mode. below are the port settings. currently, serial, USB- and USB / FireWire mass storage space are supported.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end you can set the path for USB- and Firewire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link). this field is only active if you have a USB- or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera's camera. you have to specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / space when you enter your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digiplug; you need to connect the camera to your computer to set it in the display mode.</seg>
<seg id="329">Try out whether & digicame; the camera automatically detects and set the camera. if you have set up your camera, your camera will be displayed in the camera menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. it is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window. if you own more than a camera, you can insert them here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option dialog for relocating &gt; images in the trashcan you can adjust the conversation of & digiplug; when deleting a photos into an album. in the clearing of a photos and deletion of a album you will find further details.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes due to the right side bar can be shut down by & digiplug; if you use the option to use in the right sidebar no back questions. otherwise, you need to use the changes to the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also download the display of the welcome screen of & digiplug; when starting, this will accelerate the start step by & digiplug;</seg>
<seg id="334">The setup of the start after new photos may search & digicame; the base file after new or dissolved albums / photos. if something from the base folder was deleted, ask & digicame; you ask whether it is to delete these from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different colour schemas can be used in & digiplug; used to adjust the main window to your taste. this settings can select under settings design from the toolbar. a preview of available designs will be listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in simple text files. if you are interested in a new design for & digiplug; please find further information about this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digiplug; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools. you can use this to view your photos and to correction and improvement. the image processing can be accessed by a click with the left mouse button on the preview of a picture or by the context menu of preview and selection of the details pane / editing.</seg>
<seg id="338">The picture processing contains a range of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digiplug; therefore, they are not part of your distribution. further information on the KIPI modules can be found in the section image processing.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the bottom of the window, the filename, current record number, magnification factor and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top edge and including the tool bar for quick access to the most frequently required functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The machining functions of the image processing change your photos. however, no features will change the original photo before you can't use the Save or button Save from the toolbar. note that you can not recover the original photo once you have saved the picture.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should make a copy of your image before you change it. you can save it with file Save as well.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can re-restore the original image by re-establish the button Restoration of Recover in the toolbar. you lose any change that you have done on the photo since the last store.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost any action of the image processing can be reformed or re-produced or reproduced. the last action can be reformed, by choosing working or reproduced by choosing machining from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you often use this, you should make the key shortcut, Ctrl; -z for reviewing and Ctrl; -Shift-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; you can select a button menu on the back or re-produce button in the toolbar. if you select one of the menu entries, all the actions are made between also reversed or recovered.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started the image processing, you can move between photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, picture height, image files or entries in the menu file. if you have made changes in the current photo you will be asked if you want to save it.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can enter in the photo and zoom in which you can use Ctrl; mouse or symbols in the toolbar or entries in the toolbar menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adapt a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: select the magnification factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode. when you don't want to use the Esc button. normally you can't change this in the setup dialog for & digiplug; you can call this out of the & digiplug; see section for setting up the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current picture, you can select the image file in the menu and get the default & kde; print dialog. you can customize the settings before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print individual pictures or full sentences. you need to select the images with the standard methods and select from the menu album Export Print. if you want to follow the assistant, you will only need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The main window is available; main window has a sidebar at the right edge, which is important information and actions for the selected images. the same sidebar is available without the navigation use, even in the image processing. it will be displayed if one of the five riders is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple Click on the same rider does the sidebar appear or disappear again in the edge.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the supervents view you can enter or insert it. note the text below. the text is UTF-8 compatible. that means that all special characters are allowed. the labelling will be copied to EXIF- and IPTC- fields so that you can use other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are truncated to 2000 characters. if you want to use the IPTC label in other applications, you should consider these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you comment it, use either the button of user or change to the next image, which will be stored then.</seg>
<seg id="358">Besides the user button you can read a button More. with this, you can read further metadata from the selected file or database. however, you can always select the metadata to the files. however, this will always be performed if you have a metadata setting.</seg>
<seg id="359">The section assessment shows an evaluation scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorters. it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or with the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. in order to evaluate multiple images at the same time, select this from and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is written in the IPTC field identifier. the coding follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keyword, the keyword tree and a selection box with the previously used in this & digiplug; -session.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree will be dynamically adapted to the given search word. you can quickly restrict the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword. this ability is especially useful if you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom end is a further relief during the input of sample words in a picture series. if you have entered different words, these are saved for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Tags can also be set by marking the corresponding checkboxes in the tree. all tags of a picture are stored in the IPTC field Keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If several pictures are selected in the main screen and select a keyword in the keyword tree, this is only applied to the highlighted picture and not to the entire selection, if you want a selection with a keyword, please read the section Keyword filter.</seg>
<seg id="366">The sidebar keyword filter is used to change the selection of displayed in the main window. usually, the left sidebar is used with their album, - filming, keyword and viewpoints. if additionally one or several keyword filter from the right-hand side will be used, only the volume of these two are displayed. all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also draw tags and put them off. if the keyword already exists, you can simply drag them to the right side bar and put them on the selection. then a dialog box that asks you asks if you want to put the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the above example, the main window shows the images on a calendar day. the keyword filter is reduced to no matter what the amount is reduced to three pictures. you were taken to Ctrl + a and then a keyword from the right-word tree was taken into the selection and put there. a dialog asks if this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place in any start of the program. you can also be disabled under the settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and notice that it should be a or should be, you can easily change this easily with a double click on the text and the rules.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): entry to be found in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or a string, is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can define a Extended search over all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to grouping options, you need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then to use the button group. the options are shown as follows:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why did Picasaweb or Flickr are not listed? the free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the pictures in full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / Tutorial was written mainly by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I shared it mainly at & digicame; s concrete implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why one uses a colorized workflow or scanned colors are the colors used by your camera or scanners. with a color-administered workflow you can reach the colors on your monitor from your camera or scanners, or the colors they publish or in the web, which correspond to your digital dark chamber.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the topic is on color administration, then everyone wants to press what buttons must be provided for the results that he would like to provide you. unfortunately, the sense of this tutorial is available to give you sufficient background information about color management. in addition, you should make links with deeper information enable you to obtain the desired results.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your screen workflows shall be met all six below criteria, then you must not take care of the colour scheme.</seg>
<seg id="380">You can work on a monitor that is calibrated on the RGB-color space. (more information please see below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other photo expenditures are via e-mail or the web, where the RGB is the de-facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if the RGB works so well and the life for all so easy, why should one use another color space and make sure thought about color holes?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of limitation of RGB compared to the colors we really can see below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the hufeisenshaped region, and the colors in the RGB color space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB using a few larger colours, please visit Bruce Lindblooms page and click on info and then on information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I need to monitor my monitor if I decided to work in the RGB color space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you work in the RGB color space or not, you need to connect your monitor to your monitor. if you work as a RGB space of sRGB, you need to use either your monitor on the RGB standard alligator, use a matching monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections to improve the image in most cases. use it therefore before you are attempting to open a further manual.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, the same, Automatically and contrast expand from the menu to correct automatic correction, try automatically from your colors the best. you will have to experiment with these effects, to see what works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaled the entire picture, so that the darkest point is black and the brightest item as bright as possible without changing its color shades. this function is often a Magical correction for images that are dark or balanced.</seg>
<seg id="391">The same method: this method is adjusted the illuminator of the colors of the selected image so that the histogram of the intensity of a picture, sometimes it produces only trash. it is a very powerful operation that causes either wonders in a picture or it destroyed it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue duct. it calculates the dark and bright tone tones, and adjusts the red, green and blue channels on the complete histogram area.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast enlarge: this method improves contrast and luminosity of the RGB values of a picture through the postpone of the lowest and highest values of all values between. this is only visible in balanced images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white off of & digiplug; is a semi-automated tool to perform the white off of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white-off correction is somewhat limited since via an color space with 8-bit per color. if you can do so far from the original image, if you can perform white off in the raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your ways will fall better to correction.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white orderly algorithm of the copyright by Pawel T. Jochym. they start the menu entry colours white off the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left hand we can see both the original image and preview of the target image. the preview can be adapted to the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original whitish again, then it is enough to enlarge the window.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red marker. the luminance of the Pixels under this marker is displayed as vertical line in histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">To the right is a histogram, as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in good illuminated images, most pixels are displayed very small Luminants. with a button you can choose whether one of the three colors or your sum will be displayed. the sum will be Luminanz.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadows, saturation and Gamma. the shadows is adjustable to improve the shadow details of your photos or down dimming.</seg>
<seg id="401">Anstat with the above controls mentioned above, you should use the colour temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the images to calculate the color temperature of the white image. on this species also the temperature and green values are set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white off with the list of default settings. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors if more than a color channel of the Pixels is exposed. you will get the combined result in white off. this will appear in a preview of a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons Save as and load make exactly this. any adjustment of the white image you can set it into a text file and later reload.</seg>
<seg id="405">The knob settings puts all the filter values again on its standard values and associated neutral white effects. note that also neutral settings can be found as your original. if you store this, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set the encoding per color channel of the machined image. 8-bit encoding is better suited for high quality images. however, this coding is also needed for high quality images. however, this coding is also needed for the formats of PNG, PNM, TIFF, and DNG formats.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialogue like the processing of raw images. it uses the modification and assignment of color profiles. a detailed instructions for use of color profiling can be set to the chapter of paint administration.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu below colors. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously. this is helpful if your camera or your scanner may always make the same errors, and therefore you always need the same correction. in the manual for the MP3 correction, you will find further information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful option of exposure problems to correct is the tool for gradation, that you can find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digiplug; Toolkit displays four colour effects, a solar effect effect, a Velvia filter, a Neon Effect and an edge filter available.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, Solarisation, also called Sabatier, a effect from the additional light. this had the effect that the brighter areas of darker and the colours have been inverted by the second lighting. the result was a partial negative image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar system. at approx. 50% intensity, the picture shows what is chemically possible. another increase creates a negative image that is not to generate on photopapier.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar panel. the original image is the (1) and the process (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it distinguishes itself from a saturation that makes it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glittering. try it easy to embellate many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for a stunning colour film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm; the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvias are very saturated color in daylight and high contrasts. these characteristics are also some photographers, especially those which are hardly any landscapes.</seg>
<seg id="416">The Neonfilter simulates neonlight on the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repetitions the strength of the Neonlight. at large images the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it's not unusual that you want to correct the color Contrast and the luminosity of photos. as soon as you can be satisfied with the result. once you are satisfied with the result, use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo of poor lighting conditions, you can get a good choice to increase saturation instead of saturation. all changes you can perform in preview. if the result you like the result, you can confirm your changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex set of gradation and the simple Leuk strength / contrast / Gamma is the tool tape correction for improving the exposure. even if the dialogue has been very complicated, you need only the range of shooting. specifically the three shooting below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graphs are three slugs to change the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to get to the operation is the knob to postpone and make sure the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right hand, the original and preview of the image can be viewed. the preview will be dynamically modified, based on the settings of the image, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: this selection box can be set if the histogram with a linear or logarithmic Y-axis is frequently used in pictures of a constant colour. in pictures the linear histogram is dominated by a single column. in this case the logarithmic influence is useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three knobs: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for medium sounds, often called Gammaize.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color buttons can be used in the preview of the original image, to automatically adjust the input values of the shadow, medium and bright tones automatically. furthermore, there is a button for fully automatic alignment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow a selection of manual values for each field. there are also two controllers also used to change the output values like in the input values. the compression of the output values may be used to create a light picture as background, while something else is foreground to see.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button, the image values are set automatically depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save and loading: with these buttons, the set values can be stored in the file system and re-loaded later. the Gimp level format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you are using this mode and the three colour pipettes, the input values will automatically be adjusted automatically for all shade, funds and sun shades. enable the colour pipette which you want to use and click on the preview of the HistoProgram for red, green, blue and luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The option overexposed pixels controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it is not an effect on the final outcome.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below, take an example of the alignment of input values to the red, green and blue channel of a photos. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the correct picture with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left hand, half of the originals and the target image will be shown. the preview will be updated automatically depending on your settings. on the right hand the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modification channel: this selection box allows to use the channel that is modified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this cheese there are two symbols to change between one linear and a logarithmic view. for images with a digital camera, linear mode produces a wide beam. in this case, the logarithmic mode helps in this case.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a circuit board to the right, e.g. the bright tones, then you can see that these bright tones correspond with darker output files and the corresponding image pixel are darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">In the preview of the original photos is a red flag. if you want to change this marking on the area you want to change the original score. create a point on this line and move it on and off until the value is adjusted according to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save and loading: with these buttons you can make exactly this. each curve may be saved in the file system and later to be loaded. the file format is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">When using this method and the three colour pipettes automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of the shadow, medium and sun tones. enable the colour pipette which you want to use and click on the original image to put the control points for the rotor, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The overexposed pixel option controls all color channels to display overexposed pixel. if in more than one channel overexposed pixel, you will get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it is not an effect on the final outcome.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-white photo that has been corrected in the luminance channel. shadow and sun tones was applied with the colour pipette and adjusted to the curves. the original image is (1) and this corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer of the & digicame; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels, or change the color shades of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix color shades of the images. you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer for image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box you can select the color for the histogram. this gives you a first note how you can adjust the relative distribution and rash. the left section of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed as opposed to their own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you positioned this in the picture, a vertical line in histogram is displayed by giving you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are right below: knob for red, green and construction allow you to keep these channels too. if you also activate the color mixer, since the channel mixer then is the tool to generate great black-and conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black-and-white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix monochrome, the reduction of a colour is to be found in the same place in the colour channel and whose premise looks different in each channel. if this is the case you can improve your monochrome conversion by reducing the farbrauschen in which you first reduce the farbrauschen.</seg>
<seg id="447">The Save as and store buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any mixer mode allows you to save and then load. that used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The option overexposed pixels controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it is not an effect on the final outcome.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a picture in which the blue channel was newly adjusted. the original image is activated (1) and the illustrated picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a step forward because color pictures can be easily converted to the computer. also with a set of film rolls profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lensenate filter. this looks good for all scene pictures and fits especially good to portraits against the sky. thus similar to 004 Cokin (TM) Green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with an orange link filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and air photos. thus similar to the 002 Cokin (TM) orange filter.</seg>
<seg id="454">Rotate: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic celiar effects and can simulate Moonbleshooting for the day time. thus, similar to the 003 Cokin (TM) Rotate.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with an yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color correction and improves contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to 001 Cokin (TM) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: this creates warm bright and medium sounds during a little cold in the shadows. this is very similar to the process of a pressure and the development in a sepia schooner. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to 005 Cokin (TM) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the & digiplug; mould texture can apply decorative textures on an image to apply.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, whether it is a colour screen or not, you can look like a oil painting on a canvas, the pins of an old master, a Pop Art portrait of enlarged points or like a wall picture on a wall. the menu entry picture texture can be used for this.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: postpone of this parameter to the right increases the depth of the depth and three-dimensional texture of the texture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text effect is applied on the photo below. the original picture is (1) and the changed under (2). the relief is set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">Add & digiplug; tool frame Adding a decorative frame to be added to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">The eye of a viewer in the limits of a photos is no easy task. a possibility to maintain its attention to create a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for scattering eye. under picture frame, the module can be made from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter set the desired frame type for your picture. consistent with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black-and-white pictures), stirring it with a nice three-dimensional frame of the ideal is ideal for a button setting and decoratively adds a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: specifies the width of the frame in percent. the value range for the width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">This is larger than the original, but the same aspect ratio is larger than the original, but the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing images, especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this practical tool, you can easily insert a format in any picture at any point. this also goes on several digits when you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitively used. simply use text direction, orientation, color from the colour space and the character set with its characteristics as you need them. you'll simply select the character set size. to the end you'll simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background. already, the picture is finished.</seg>
<seg id="468">Each setting you have chosen for your text can be changed to the button "OK" after the picture has been stored once, the text is part of the picture. it can't be changed anymore.</seg>
<seg id="469">To get the & digiplug; Tool Templates can create a stencil over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu image Templates which can be used in the image processing can be used to create templates over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For stencil there is no restrictions regarding the size and orientation. you need to add your template format and should then add to the compression size of template. if you want to add your templates and digiplug; you simply send an e-mail in English to the & digiarrived; mailinglist digiarrived-Users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time you need to set your template folder with the button base folder in the dialog. select the folder where you copied the template files. these settings are indicated for next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder for stencils, a building back is displayed, which reflects the size structure of the stencil template. the selection of a folder will be updated automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">There are three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this knob enlarges the following image. it will be centered around the position of your mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrink: this knob resized the lower picture. if you want to use the mouse button. if you want to use the template on the whole picture you need to size the picture accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Postpone: use this button to postpone the picture below the template. take the picture and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to use template on your picture. the image will then be adjusted automatically the preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digicame; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of them has preferences in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it's very fast and easy, but, especially in dark areas, grains pictures.</seg>
<seg id="481">Unsharpeness mask works on the contrast of edges to look like a picture-sharply. it can use it to remove atmospheric Dunst and it makes it a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is protected by copyright by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocus is the best of the three because it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its use and has different parameters for adapting.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitised images require a correction of the sharpness. this again shows that sharp edges need to be printed on paper. this is that sharp edges need to be printed on paper. SLR cameras require usually more subsequently sharpness as normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">At JPEG pictures, a camera was often used in sharpening. images in the raw format must always be processed in the processing format.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners apply a sharpeness filter already during the reading of the image. if you disable it, you will get the control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get usable results by sharpening a photo of sharpening sharpening. you can correct sharpening in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="487">They should be careful, as the results are not extremely natural: the sharpness increase sharpness of edges, but also amplifies the noise. in general, it is a usable technique to sharpening the tool. in general, you can find further information and compare all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: one image is too crispy, it is much easier to draw. use the tool to correct switch and experimenting with the menu entry. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter spurred is a very good tool to remove sliders from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview Help the image. the preview window shows the issue of the filter with the current Settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values produce good results and should be tried first. a increase in radius or viewing amplify the effect. if you produce the unsharpened mask, smoke and the impression of grates in the vicinity produce sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius will be like many pixels on each side of a edge through the filters. high-resolution images allow larger radii. you should therefore sharpens pictures at the best in its final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the wiped image one which is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The swelling value is a break out of the maximum RGB value and the difference difference. one can define the minimum difference to an edge of the filter. in this way, areas may be used with a soft change between the tones of sharpening and therefore feit errors in faces, directions and water surface.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the unblurred filters. the original image is the (1) and the revised picture (2). unblurred was used with a radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a swing value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digicame; Tool reagent focus on an image through improvement of the edge. it used the urgent inactivation filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to sharpen a picture. this is better approach as merely to try to sharpen drawing. this is better to use a technique called FIR Viennese filtering. usually better results can start better results as unblurred. you can start it from the menu by calling colour reproduction in the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular flicker is much better than the Gauss's folding. the Gauge has a very long tail, which are far away from the swelling pixel. the FIR Wiener Inverse of the Gauss's Fsplit is even influenced in most cases, which causes adverse outcomes.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the most important parameter for the use of this module. for most pictures should result the default value 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your image is very unblurred but then on the Heiligenschone.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: a correlation of correlation can help to reduce artifacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. useful values are 0.5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation is reduced to the sharpness of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Rauschfilter: an increase in the space filter can help you reduce artifacts. however, values are higher than 0.1 only rarely found. if the smoke filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very poor. a usable value is 0,03. a good value is still further contamination.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauss's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauss's sharpness. use this parameter to avoid unsharpensive filter. in most cases, you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you must use a value unequal zero, then you may also increase the correlation and / or the sound filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of transformation matrix. an increase of the matrix size can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the circular edge or the Gauss's sharpness. note that the module is very slow if you choose to choose large values for this parameter. in most cases, you should select a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The stores and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any reproduction parameters will be set to you later and then it can be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try all trimming, color and intensity correction on the picture before you use the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the image. the reason for this is that many operations changes are not visible immediately, but leave later unpleasant artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you want to read images and compressed, & eg; when JPEG, you should use the module to uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, the sharp maskbar produces better results as sharpening. this could be caused by the insharp maskbar a bigger neighbourhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically it must always be unblurred. even under optimal conditions it is never possible to remove the effect of the unshark. however, the result of the FIR Wiener Filters is always good as good as the unsharpened mask. the FIR Wiener filter is often better when machining small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below, you can see a comparison between different filters, applied on a small unfocused picture:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp colour screen has to be corrected. this picture has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is attributable to insufficient light for the auto-focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information about methods to sharpening methods in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">"" "the knob" "" "knob" "" "knocked the sharpeness of the darkening area to create a better Pupille." ""</seg>
<seg id="514">The colour tints allows an adapted color for the pupil. if you want to set blue eyes instead of dark, then you can set it here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The error correction is one of the most widely developed tool in order to remove the desired artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The algorithm was developed by the IMAGE Team of GREC CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains several default settings as Starpoints to simplify the restoration work. the default settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">In case you want to adjust the filter settings, you can use the riders and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Typically, p [0, 100]: this controls the maintenance of the details. if larger values leads to a smooth glass of smooth regions and details sharp. a value of 0.9 should receive mainly homogeneous regions, and details sharp. please note that the details of sharpeness should always be subdivided.</seg>
<seg id="520">The direction-dependency Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoother evenly into all directions, while a value close to 1 is only allowed in one direction. if you have a film-scale or CCD noise, a high value can be created. JPEG Artefacts will be eliminated at a value close to 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smoothing [0, 500]: this puts the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing. adjust this value to the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is needed. this is difficult if it is difficult to generate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: are on how often the algorithm is running through. usually 1 or 2 goes out.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle length da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of the anisotropic Alpha. if Alpha is selected, there should also be small. make sure that small angle should be a long run time. you should select this value as greatest possible and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integrative stride length [0,1, 10]: integral stride length in pixels. you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never exceed 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation use: the more to quality you receive by selecting this option is only low. it doubles the running time. we recommend it to leave it.</seg>
<seg id="527">Buttons Save as and load make exactly this. any setting of image error correction can be saved in a text file and later reloaded.</seg>
<seg id="528">Image error correction is comparatively very fast when working. it can still take very long and take a high CPU load after yourself. you can therefore break the calculation anytime with the button.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how picture error fixing is corrected. the module is shown in a photo that was made in Guatemala City with a analog camera. as you can see there is a strange black artefacts in the foreground that caused by a bad movie storage during the journey. the original picture is below (1) and the correct picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digicame; noise reduction is a powerful tool to reduce noise levels. it uses a protected protected algorithm of Peter tailert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artifacts, e.g. from dust or hair on the lens, too. it can be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or fashion; effects of saved pictures from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read this in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screen photo above shows a typical scene which has been made with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grayless noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, only the bottom windows and the lower-window settings can stay with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) which is used for the filter. large values increase the time that the filter per pixel can be used and the picture can spread over the image and the colour in it is smoother and therefore smaller errors.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpenile seal. this value does not adjust the pixel pitch to establish luminance changes. if it is increased, you need to change the edges. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image data can not get more and noise or lubricating again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. if it is too strong, the frequency response of the filter. if it is too heavily, the whole noise can occur or Rauschism. put it on a value close to the maximum, if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artifacts without any details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Light density: controls the luminance of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoother process by the details -settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoother process by the details -settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamemolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase tolerance values of darker areas, which typically are stronger, however, he contaminated the shadow ranges.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the adjustment of the Phasenjittering damping. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius will appear. if it is increased, the edges appear, if it is too high, the noise and Phasenjitter appear on the edges. it can remove robotting and is the recommended method for it.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and store: these buttons are used exactly for this. all parameters for the spacer which you have set, can be saved in the file system and later loaded.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected using (2). the noise reduction was applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is crisp for your purpose. the solution to sharpen the image is much easier than a picture. use tool to correct switch and experimenting with the menu entry. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digicame; photo restoration is definitely one of the most widely developed tools to reduce photo acts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts, film grain, scratches, compression acts and local errors that create in digital, original or subsequently digitised images to remove. the smoothing occurs along the image contours and thus gets the contents like it also makes the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and textured encryption. the algorithm is developed with another tool, the image error correction. the algorithm was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS Labors in Caen / Franní and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artefacts reduce: compression of JPEG is not perfect in some areas, it creates some compression & quot; Artefacts & quot; - small standards that are displayed in uncompressed image. this setting is to correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons Save as and load make exactly this. each setting of photo restoration can hereby be saved in a text file and later reloaded.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can still take very long and take a high CPU load after yourself. you can therefore break the calculation anytime with the button.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can reduce like a photo with equal noise.. The module is applied to a black and white photo that has been absorbed by a Minolta (TM) HP-5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the infamous film specimens on the faces. the original image is below (1) and the corrected visual under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below, you can see another example of photo restoration. this time, textures was applied to an old color photograph, which has been read with a scanner. you can see the scan species from the scannerical and the photopapier. the original picture is below (1) and the correct picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digiplug; tool Hotpixel allows for hotpixel of photos that were with a CCD camera, eight were too removed. it uses the algorithms from the JPEGPixi project that are protected by copyright by Martin Dickens.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, tote or hot pixels are a problem with high quality raw quality photos, as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixel quot; and "quot; bright pixel quot; there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the button dark image. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important to discover the dark image directly in the connection to discover new hot or bright pixel by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should download the appropriate dark image to the correct image. please note that the assistant will remark the last dark image and reload this automatically at the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and the preview can help you correct within the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are highlighted in all aspects.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to view the defective pixels on preview and the results of the filter. then choose the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the following filters:</seg>
<seg id="561">Thirst: an average of the neighboring pixel is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in a block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from pixel can be moved to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the damaged pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a gap of 2 or less to the pixel block are moved to compute an bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Kubisch: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less then moved to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the damaged pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below, you can see the hotpixel correction on a color photograph, from a damaged digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure to be applied. the original image has been increased to 300% (1) and the correct picture is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digiplug; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the Vignetting, i.e. downexposed corners, a picture to correct.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lens, particularly those in the medium and large photo format, can not evenly illuminate the entire sensor range instead. instead & quot; vignetting quot; (shaded) to reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light to the sensor there.</seg>
<seg id="568">But he also has disadvantages. many center filter require a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the blending filter, which should be impossible to keep the camera with hand. wide angle lens should also use, also with center filter, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, otherwise unshark effects arise.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure ranges of today's filming and colour gradation of digital cameras and film scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter, which is used without this filter. the tool Vignetting correction is based on an image filter. the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">Using three controllers, you can control the Vignetting correction-Filter and with three further exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light output at the point of the highest density, the default density is 2.0, which allows an optical filter with a aperture setting of 1, or randomly to compensate the density to compensate a greater degree of Vignetting to compensate it to compensate a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Leuchstarch, contrast and Gamma -Settings: the processing of a picture with the Vignetting correction is reduced by the luminance of pixels. you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the knob must provide you only positive values because you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a more sensitive re-adjustment of the target image, so you can use the values for luminosity / contrast / Gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digiplug; image processing from the menu color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignetting correction to a picture. the original image (1) shows the Vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected picture. a Leucholine and contrast correction was also carried out in the picture with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digicame; lens distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a protected domestic algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool operates with geometric distortion. colorless distortion can not be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second grades treated the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex shape of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third grab has a similar effect effect, fleight on edges. this correction is not applied to the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of coefficient corrects the remote corners opposite the second degree. if you combine these two, every geometric distortion is almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">Generally: this value controls the strength of distortion second grades. with negative values, tons of distortion can be corrected and positive values of cissenic distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of distortion fourth Grades. this value gets stronger than in the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lentils the 'corners parameter set the parameter to the parameter General.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scaled the image size and results in a correction first Grades through. negative values increase during positive image.</seg>
<seg id="583">Bright: this value adjusted the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you get the best filter settings, illustrated the dialog with a preview of distortion. the values you are using for your image, are stored and used at the next start as standard values.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tons or kissenic correction should be carried out before all trimming or size changes. best, you perform this correction as all the first. if you want to cut a picture and then a tons-shaped correction would be the effect of apparent the falcons.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction you can display this tool a vertical and a horizontal relief line. move it to an important place, such as the sea side or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this spot. in the connection, you can correct the tons / kissenic distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you have a kissenic distortion is the resulting image black corners. you can cut them with the cutting tool in the menu transformer cutting from the image processing or using the zoom knob this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most pictures the tonnage is sufficient. the next logical step for some designs, such as recordings from the front, frame and paintings, it is the perspective to correct the all angles in the picture 90 degrees. note that if you keep the camera with hand, you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tons-shaped correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is below (1) and the correct picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method for simulating infrared film the GimpGuru.org website, which can be accessed below this URL. filter reproduces the known Ilford (TM) SFX200 Iinfrared film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window you can choose the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with your mouse, you can view the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can set two parameters to simulate film grain and film sensitivity (ISO). the ISO knob changes the amount of film pieces and the dominance of colour green (chlorophyll in nature) in transformation. green meadows are white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter canals for reproduce infrared film, especially the green canal makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos, as the color information are missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of infra-red cinemas applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is under (1) and the illustrated picture below (2). the sensitivity of the film has been set to ISO 400. higher ISO values produce a type of aura in peak lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digiplug; filter trays is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film pieces like the B / W Kodak Tri-X, for example the sensitivity of the movies to increase the manufacturers large silver grains of the photemulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film-effect booster gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. the previously treated picture gets rid of a timeless atmosphere of daily life. if you want to use this special, gallery-like, road photo, grained view, especially in your monochrome photos, you need to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the controller, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although higher values are needed, if you need more baskets, you can use the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of film gradation for a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and this worked the (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digiplug; filter oil paintings creates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digiplug; filter oil paintings gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting. natural pictures and style are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There exist two controllers in order to influence this effect. the upper chooses the brush size between one and five. thick brush are better suited for large images. smooth or, from the other side, consider the right.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with (1) and the processing is marked with (2). pin size for this 640 pixel image is 1 and Glory 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digiplug; filter coal drawing used color and intensity gradients to create a sprout in the drawing, are emphasized. images whose gradient can be slowly change if you would like to imagine what scene you would have chosen to skate you. this would be good pictures to start.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob chooses the pin size and the lower adjusted the contrast (Glory).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the charcoal drawing filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be improved further by adjusting the intensity level.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digicame; filter engraving your image in 3-D, as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a protected domestic algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digiplug; filter engraving is a fast tool to return your images with a 3-D effect. it works very well with pictures with a simple structure, where colour is not the most important part of the content. the filter uses the difference between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey, monochable landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to set the contrast of the filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the machined picture (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork with distortion effect. it uses copyright protected algorithms by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divides the image into cells, and will look like whether it is viewed by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analogue to wave blocks 1 shows the picture here with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects need a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel this effects at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork with an adverse effects. it uses copyright protected algorithms by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Unsharfe: wipe the picture along a circular lines coming from a central point. this simulates the unsharpened camera and creates a dynamic expression of often in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radical insharpness: twisted the image by rotation of pixels around a central point. this simulates the unsharpened camera of a turning camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Remover-sharpness: wipe the picture around the effect of a non-focused camera content. the object seems to come back in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Movement of movement: veraging the image by horizontal movements of pixels. this simulates the sharpness of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photographer, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Soft psharpness: wipe the image soft in the dark and strongly in bright tones. this creates photos with a dreaming and shiny sharp focus effect (Hamilton Effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or to add a warm and subtiling bulb.</seg>
<seg id="620">Schütgunsharfe: wipe the image through random displacement of pixels and simulates the imaging of a arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent unsharfe: finds the color slide in the picture and wipe it without the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: divide the photo in rectangular cells and then created it, by filling with an average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects need a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore break this calculation anytime with the button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The drops are a nice small tool to make rain drops on your picture. this makes it possible to make natural your images a great look. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn protected algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Tropical size to change the size of the tropics. since the drop-size does not grow automatically with the size of the picture, it is often necessary to reduce the size and density of drops. fish augen changes the optical effect of the drop in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can stop using the & digiplug; image processing a range free from raindrops. use the range of tools to select the area, e.g. a face that will remain free. if you then start the filter drops, the area is free of rain drops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the shelf filter. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the machined picture (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation so you can bring it by mirrors or turning into the right orientation. you can find the tools in the menu Transformers or transformer mirrors.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo bubbles is definitely one of the most widely developed tools in order to enlarge a picture at a minimum loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">A picture to smaller is simple. the big question is how you can find a picture blasting and the details sharp? how can you find the missing information or guess right? the Cimg algorithm is used here, makes it a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can change it onto the desired size with the size size. select a transforming size in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog box is visible below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool can change a linear interpolation method to switch the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality, then try the tool to blow up.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image processing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. split line interpolation to enlarge a picture. & digiplug; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool like you want to change the size. these settings are available in the rider New size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Keeping the aspect ratio: when this setting is activated, the aspect ratio of the original size is maintained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is needed. this is difficult if it is difficult to generate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">Buttons Save as and store are used exactly. each entry for photo can be saved as text file and later reloaded.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo blending is very fast when doing it, but it can still take very long and take a high CPU load after yourself. you can cancel the calculation anytime with the button.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example of photo postcard by adding a small paint picture to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (2) is the result of the linear standard magnification.</seg>
<seg id="640">The cutting of a photos is not only a frequently performed surgery, but also a frequent invaluable tool to create a picture. the mouse just need to create a picture with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and drag the rectangle, then you will see this rectangle while you move your mouse over.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you cut off the mouse button again the area of the photos will be cut out. by this you will get a good overview of your photo after cutting, by clicking on the corners of the rectangle, simply create a new rectangle with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">As soon as you are satisfied with the cutting section, use the button The button-button of the image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the entries file Save or file Save below in the menu to save the newly designed photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview area you can change the size of the rectangle by postpone the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog will maintain.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the set-up ratio, you can specify orientation as high-format or lateral format. in the high format, the larger value of the height and in the lateral format of the width is assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool goes with aspect ratio, which means that it is always equal, regardless of whether you use centimeters, inch or any other physical size. you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photopapier and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog, there are two buttons to make the selection automatically horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below in the dialog you can set with the Max. Ratio of the section to cutting the maximum possible, depending on the selected ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool goes after aspect ratio, setting its settings depending on the orientation orientations (Horizontal or Vertical). if you are using the input tool the next time, these settings are stored in the EXIF tables, so the EXIF data are reflected the resulting image and not the original picture.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the merchanger help enable to insert your images better, so that you are better to summarize your pictures:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic particles are based on the principle of similarity. like the third organ, harmonic triangles are a possibility to share a rectangle in similar harmonical triangles.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden middle: the golden middle is a pitch that is found on various natural growth models, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the blankets of a sunflower. it appears in all possible things that we can find as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden partition is the error number 1,618033988... and you already used to construct your temple and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to put your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; from where any number is equal to 1 equal to the sum of its two. one composition is as visual harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides liquid lines available when you start a picture. these help will be recorded down below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spiral will bring you good results for your photos. compared to third-party nails, the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the picture. this type of composition runs along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetric visual flow.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. it should be something that the eye into the core of the composition. it can be a line or different objects. that something can be just there without the eye, it will fulfill his task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden triangles are also coming from the above-mentioned golden spiral. their vertices are the middle points of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonic triangles, golden triangles are not equilateral triangles. diagonal to this lines can be extended to dynamic object.</seg>
<seg id="658">When you use golden triangles around your frame, you will create a effect of professional photographers dynamic Symmetry. try your focus at one of the intersections and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you can't reach any other way.</seg>
<seg id="659">The Options Horizontal mirror and Vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmonic particles.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the auxiliary lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the help lines can be invisible. on this type, you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free rotation is a tool to rotate an image around any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, then it happens easy to keep the camera not exactly vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which the things are turned around an angle. you can manually repair this with the & digiplug; Please choose transforming free rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your image with the slide angle. the values on this slider are specified in degrees. with the knob you can set the slider back to 0 degrees. a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture will be displayed on the right above.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the Free rotation is transmitted via a horizontal and vertical line. move your mouse over the two lines. after you move it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now, adjust the angle as described in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have turned a picture, you will find undesirable triangular holes in the corners. an option to repair it is to use this function transformer cutting from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is automatic cutting. choose one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option sets the picture a bit after the rotation. however, note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All pertinent transformations are performed by a fixed point of the reference point. this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares in the corners of your picture. the preview will then be recharged automatically. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including the empty sections created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image including the empty sections created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle to the left: shows the current angle in degrees on the upper left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Right above: shows the current angle in degrees on the upper right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle to the left: shows the current angle in degrees on the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle to the right below: shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image will aminated a little bit. for a single adjustment this effect is small, but two adaptations produce a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have changed the perspective, you will get unpleasant triangular holes at the corners. one way to bersome it is the picture with transformations cutting from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The scoring tool is used to move a part of the picture in one direction and postpone another part to the opposite. this is no rotation, the image will distorted. with other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram. you can start this module via transformer.</seg>
<seg id="679">Note your picture by using the horizontal and vertical angle. if you want to press the horizontal and vertical corners. if you want to default, the angles will be reset to zero. a preview of the effectiveness will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image are shown on the right of the preview range.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help you will end a vertical and horizontal line. move your mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the box tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have carried out the cabinet, the picture will become a bit deeper. for a single shift, this effect is usually neglected, but two chings produced twice as much as impact and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the shooting, the image has unusual triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate them is the picture with transformations cutting from the image processing.</seg>

Flickr is possible to come to anyone who is important. you can show your favorite photos from the world, showing photos of your camera file online and show your photos safely and personally your friends and your family around the world.</seg>
<seg id="797">The Export to Flickr can be used to upload images from your computer to a Flickr Server on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="798">If you use the module for the first time you will run through the process of creating a Tokens. this is therefore virtually your identification to Flickr. a browser is started to sign up in Flickr.</seg>
<seg id="799">After successful login, the module can send photos to Flickr website. them will be presented the following page following a successful application.</seg>
<seg id="800">Simply connect the browser window and return to the program. after you have pressed Yes, you will get the dialog for upload photos to Flickr. this will be shown in the next section.</seg>
<seg id="801">When the module exports to Flickr's second time, you will be greeted with the following dialogue, which shows the current access permission. the module currently does not require any other permissions. you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions.</seg>
<seg id="802">The button photos should be pressed once after you have set all other options. with this button you can also instantly upload photos. if you press on the Ok button, the uploading of the photos to Flickr Server starts.</seg>
<seg id="803">The Tags can be filled with a separate list of words. these are added to the image as keywords:</seg>
<seg id="804">With the options open, friends and Famillie, you can set the access rights to your pictures. by default, photos are considered private.</seg>
<seg id="805">If you select the option changing the size of the photos before uploading, the photos are changed before uploading in size. size is taken from the maximum size registered value.</seg>
<seg id="806">The maximum size can be used to define the maximum height of the pictures. the size is thus modified that the aspect ratio remains constant.</seg>

<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographic localization is available to localize images geographically in the spherical coordination system, which is used by GPS and Galileo. height, longitudinal and latitude grade are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlated your images with geographical data you need a GPS track of XML file in the GPX format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical localization of correlator. this interface can merge a number of selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images that you want to correlate in the main window and call the menu on. the above-looking dialog appears to load a possible correlation of time and localization. this file contains of course data recorded at the same time, as the pictures of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">If the file uploaded a automatic correlation, the coordinates will be done in red. GPS track data is recorded in GMT-time and therefore, the camera-time is converted to GMT. this can be done with the time zone. set up your camera zone.</seg>
<seg id="815">The deviation for the maximum period of time is a upper deviation for the GPS time and camera-time. the deviation is below, the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you do not have any trace data from one place for pictures you can edit the GPX file and add to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlated all images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options of the interpoleren and difference in min. can be used if you do not have appropriate data. if you know that in reality a location in a large time difference between camera and GPS, you can set it here and then press the button correlated to the interpolder.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful if you have a number of photos on the same place. since the dialog will use coordinates from a call to the next page you need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location may also be found and set to the shown map and increase this. in addition, select the appropriate region and increase this time. the height must always be selected manually. the card can always be selected manually. the card can be changed manually. the card can be changed between map mode, satellite image and a mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module, there are ways to hang up the GPS data on the pictures. here's a small script that the exiftool is used to provide a stack of images with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module gallery is a tool to export a set of albums in HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums which are exported to HTML pages and select the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is encoded with UTF-8 encoding.</seg>
<seg id="823">The module has four riders in which the settings can be adapted to you. these albums are not allowed to choose to select the albums. the albums are not shown in hierarchically. with the three buttons on the right hand you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the area, the Albena preview and the text of the HTML page will appear.</seg>
<seg id="824">The rider appearance defines the general look and layout for each side. this rider is largely self explained. if you then click on a picture on each picture will get a new page displayed in the picture. otherwise the picture will be displayed directly with your standard viewer, & eg; Kuickshow, displayed</seg>
<seg id="825">The rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be saved with all your corresponding pictures. select a folder that contains typing. a subfolder with the name KIPIHTMLExport that contains everything will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG file format, the EXIF data will be stored in the new pictures.</seg>
<seg id="827">With other color depth, you can change the standard color depth. this also affects the file size. all other settings are self explained.</seg>
<seg id="828">The rider preview images allows you to view some of the settings from the album riders for the images that are small images shown in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window displays the user to how far the action is. press to break down the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module produces the pages, the window will not be closed automatically. you can therefore read the programs automatically. the web browser is started automatically by the end to display the preview of the gallery. press release to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI picture viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI viewer makes it possible to view a selection of images and use on them basis operations such as rotations, zooming, or offset. the viewer can be used with short-speed and masts. it was developed for fast image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start a picture is displayed in full screen mode. this can be changed in a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossless module is a tool to change images without sacrificing your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows to store images listed below in JPEG format, without the usual losses to quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of the lossless storage is that the file size is rising as there is no compression of the colour information. this one finds it again in PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera client is a tool that allows you to connect your computer with a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera client is currently no documentation. if you are interested in writing, please contact the mailing list of KIPI teams under kde-imaging @ kde.or.Note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module metadata editor is currently no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the mailing list of kimaging @ kde.org of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the import function of the metadata module you can copy data from one image to another. then select the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the file image, so the image to which you want to copy the metadata. the data will be copied to the button OK.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere but not in any target format. JPEG is supported by writing. please check exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Kodierer module is a tool to convert a series of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG Kodierer module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video, with a defined length, to convert. this module allows you to add a basic document crossing. you can also add an audio file in MP2 or WAV of the slide.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled automatically to the correct size for the selected video format. in addition, you can create a background color for the selected video format. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the media that you can use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">First you need to unpacked the images that are to be packed into MPEG Diashau. after that, you can create the module via extras MPEG Diashau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images that are selected by you are then listed under image files in the portfolio. you can also change sorting images or contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you're satisfied with your list, you should adjust the other settings. if you need to select the other settings, you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC, PAL is preset and most probably the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds which is displayed in seconds. the speed of the image is specified below. a lower value is produced very sudden, a high contrast is very smooth.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set as next. in doubt, you should leave them black. the name and path of the generated file can be set in the name of MPEG-output file. if possible, you keep the ending mpg.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you have to specify a audio file under the name of audio source file, then you can upload all the settings of the movie. depending on the speed of your computer you can easily go or drink a coffee, and enjoy the decelau if you are back again.</seg>
<seg id="851">If an indication appears that coals or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages on the right below.</seg>
<seg id="852">The printer assistent allows several pictures to print on a sheet paper together in standard Photosizes. these combined images can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gimp. this is meaningful to improve or print using the Gimp module for direct expression.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import your videos stored in the raw format in one of three formats to JPEG, TIFF or PPM respectively.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dcrab of Dave Coffin. we do not expect it from dcrab to get the same results as the software from your camera manufacturers. sometimes you get with dcrab better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First, select the RAW file to be converted and run the module. the Raw-image Converter window appears then in mode for a single picture. with the button preview can view the effect of your current settings on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option decides whether the camera settings are to be used for white, brightness and red / blue amplifiers. if the result is not optimal, you can further edit the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected, so you can use the contrast information. if your camera is working in RGB mode the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">As soon as you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the converter result. JPEG uses a lossless algorithm and produces for the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">Tagged Image Format, TIFF, retains all information of your picture and uses the lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you prefer to edit your images, you should not use the JPEG format, as there is only a limited number of operations before the image quality worsened. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you are interested in JPEG format, the metadata will contain the data stored in the JPEG file in the EXIF file.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start converting the conversion. if you want to break this process again, you can use it.</seg>
<seg id="863">The stacking mode allows you to convert various images to one time. use this mode therefore if you are safe, e.g. by testing on a single picture, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical with the version for individual pictures. however, this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt. however, this is not available. however, the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images into an album. it's used to convert the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used for renaming of all photos of an album. you can use the prefix, the starting number and timestamp of the timestamp.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of several images of a image collection. it can be used to scroll the image files from the ImageMagick package. it can be scaled to the image or enlarge it will be provided four kinds of image changes:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in a dimension. the width or height of the image is automatically selected, depending on the picture orientation, the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. here the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option e.g. to match your image format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Non-proportional: proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed at this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Printing: prepares the picture for photo printing. the user can adjust the printing resolution and the size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, edge size and background color, is correspondingly adapted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module, you can send selected images with your favorite e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the sent pictures before. further pictures can withdraw from the list of the sent pictures.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you started the module, the pictures window will be displayed with the selected images. via the button pictures you can add more images with a file selection dialog. for the most recently selected image will show a preview on the right-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag images to the list list and put them to the list of sensuing images.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the button pictures, the selected images are removed from the list of sensuing images.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all the images you can open the new message -Window of your e-mail client. you will only need to add the addresses and the subject. the images are attached here as an appendix.</seg>
<seg id="877">Don't pay attention to many images at once. most email accounts have limitations to send multiple emails if you want to send a good idea for sending e-mails if you want to send many pictures.</seg>

<seg id="918">Before HTML pages you will need to make some settings. these are summarised in the three areas, layout, and target. in the following areas, every range is discussed.</seg>
<seg id="919">First enter the title of the overlook and a description which should contain the HTML file later. in the album; HTML sample pages, you will see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select whether a & lift album; -Export file is to be created on the overviewing side. you can find additional information about export files.</seg>
<seg id="921">You can select which information is displayed on the HTML pages. thus, you can avoid that information is displayed by a party. for example, all images are exported. currently all images are exported. you can therefore not use this setting to hide specific images from certain viewing.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this area you can define which should look like the HTML pages. most importing options are clear, therefore it is not been received specifically.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can adjust different resolutions for the pictures. this means you have to consider your web page and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution of 800x600, no pictures more download the resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewing of your site allows you to change the resolution at any time, so you can search your images with low resolution, as well as if it wants to get a picture larger, it changes to higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this entry area, place the various folders and the URL to your web site is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">At best, select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new sub-folder for each subsequent proposition.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you need to select the main folder where all your pictures will be saved. this folder will be saved and next time, you can select either a folder or select from KDE support protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your images, you can check this really all for viewer. if you have created for the base folder a URL, if you have created the pages, this folder should be started. otherwise the web browser is in the incorrect folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the files created by you are not yet in the final target folder you need to manually copy them. thus the import function, see, correctly works you need to specify the final objective of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolder are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The just described setup options have changed all three to base folders or URLs. in these, a subfolder is created, whose name is set in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are looking at a meeting party, a meeting in the company, a conference or anywhere else, with other users of & coffee album; you may want to create a HTML page for viewing the images, people on the pictures, recording location, etc., then you'll need to do with & you album; this job will not even make this work once.</seg>
<seg id="932">You can import a copy of your images into a .kim file. you can import a copy of your images into a .kim file. these can import other files in your database with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in the file if the images can be stored in the file or if it is in the file only a link to the file, that you can set all images together and this file is so independent. the obvious drawback is however the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can export a .kim file either directly from the menu File Converter... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with a HTML file, this will create an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file is looking for the images that are displayed in the file of .kim file. the corresponding images are not found, so the images of the URL that you have specified in the creation of HTML files. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file using HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for Export Pictures will exporting you to the Export File menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog box is if it is to act for internal or external .kim files. there are the following three selection options available:</seg>
<seg id="938">When you copy the .kim file option, you need to copy the images into the same folder as .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the option Automatically copied to the .kim file, copy & ctionalbum; the images automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. since most pictures have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worthwhile to compress the files. if you like this, simply select the export file option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is maximum image size limit. if you would like to send your friends pictures, as the .kim file otherwise very large would be. here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with the ending .kim from the web browser or from the menu File Recovery File... Select, & you album; the exported database as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The assistant to importing is made of four steps. first you need to select which images you want to import, afterwards, in which folder you want to import pictures.</seg>
<seg id="944">It can be that you are the category people of imported file personic (if you are one dart), while this category is called for your database people, so you should be imported in the third dialog window, which are to be imported into the third dialog window, which correspond to the categories these in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step, you can select the categories of the imported file to the categories of your current database. an example for this is shown on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be simple to browse pictures and see: if you look at pictures you want to watch often within different picture groups & mdash, if you want to discover images of your Italy vacation and see a picture with your friend you might want to see all images on which this friend is illustrated.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will find the different steps from (1) to determine information on your pictures, through (2) the search and see to run up to (3) advanced topics and adjustment possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoalbum was started as a program to manage your pictures. but it was expanded and today it takes care of your videos. in many places in this manual it will be talking about images, but frequently, this also includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& lift album; stores all his information in the file index.xml in the top folder of their images. this is a simple XML file that you can copy to a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, copy to a diskette or revisions in CVS, where you want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& you album, now refer to the folder where your pictures are saved and uses this in future Starts automatically. if you want to start a different folder with images, you can start & you album; with the -c option. as an example: wired album -c ~ / company / images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">You can view the settings of the menu settings; you can proceed to a window with which you can change the settings of & kills; in the following section of the user book, the various setup options are explained.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different symbols, with which you can call attention to preview and options for the viewer. for each setting it is possible to call through a button-transfer to the F1 key and one click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It was described in you how you can define for each picture different features, such as persons, places and tags. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">You can see the dialog box to edit already existing groups. you can select a label and a symbol for any existing group.</seg>
<seg id="955">Subcategories were already mentioned in the subcategory. in the dialog box you can set complete membership groups, i.e., for example, all members of a group performed once in a group instead of all groups of a Mediglieds as in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In view the setup options you can choose to set up member types. you can select the category you want to configure. in the left-hand side there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& lift album; shares his modular system with other graphic applications, such as digiplug and Gwenview. this modular system means KIPI and means & kde; image plugin interface. please contact information on the website of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called via the modules. the modules can not be described and are not described in this manual because they are not part of & glasses; however, most modules have a help page that you can call on the modules itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules used by multiple applications can be used together, it is possible to test the modules with & kills; for example, you should always call the demo database before you call the command line with the command &gt; kphotoelectric album -Demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the menu Help. do not say, I would not warned!</seg>
<seg id="960">Applications that use the modules via KIPI are very different, thus it can be that some modules with & cass album; not work. this is the disadvantage if you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The largest difference between & coffee album; and other applications, which can also use KIPI, is that the other applications can do their pictures in albums. even if & you album, this kind of order is not supported, simulates the order for some modules, so that you can use the features with & kshafts.</seg>
<seg id="962">Simulates & wired album; the latest album, which is just the current view, so all the images that shows you at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album & lift Album; the modules have also been presented a list of albums. here is a couple of pictures, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">When & you album; s browser shows the contents of a category, e.g. all persons, then each entry represents this category a record for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it is the category you have set in the setup dialog as a category for virtual albums. for example, if you're using the category people, it will do & you album, so if you have selected persons to view and pass this.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & lift album; not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the setup dialog, and choose the modules installed which modules are loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a starting screen as soon as you book & slideshow; with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are accustomed to see from any other KDE application, you can see the window with which you have entered your image database. currently, it contains no information about your images. in the section we will look back to this window, now please click on the entry images that shows you an overview with all existing images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main features of & coffee album; is the possibility to view each image with notes, where the picture has been recorded so. you can set each image either individually or for a larger number of images certain notes. if, for example, on all images of Jesper, and all images taken in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these remarks can be used for searching and Browse if you want to read in the section if you want to see this remarks if you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In you can see three lists with a text field by using persons, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & coffee album; because you will always use them if you enter information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is the shift of images within the list: if you have a family party, and on all 50 images the same 5-10 persons can be seen, so you can relocate the used name to the top that can find people faster and arrange them.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to get an alphabetical list of alphabetical list, please click the icon for sorting after date below the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected comments for each picture you would like to edit any images and apply these images with notes. click this case easily to the above and back buttons, which are located under the preview of the picture on the top right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have several pictures, e.g. using the same person, then it can be more convenient to select all these pictures and to use the menu option added to once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all over the USA. in addition, San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you can view a browser window that shows the USA as a supergroup. to indicate that it is a special icon is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the background dialogs it is possible to add one entry to an existing or new subcategory. in addition, you can also select one entry to a category and put it in order to make this entry into a subcategory. attention, this requires that you've just alphabetically their categories in alphabetical order.</seg>

<seg id="981">You can also make a frame completely flashing. if you want to see this window later, use the button options... and then window a / out. this process can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the entry images in your browser, you will find an overview with preview images of the currently selected images, or any images, if you have no filter. you can choose the size of preview images, by simply downwards clockface to the mouse with the middle mouse button, configure. try it simply.</seg>

<seg id="987">Pictures where the right upper corner is cut, are not stored on the hard disk. for the pictures 5-9, however, these pictures are present, so & you can see the preview of these pictures. you can also view these pictures with the picture viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see this function you need to copy and copy them into your folders. if you want to avoid these files from folders. if you want to avoid trouble if you want to avoid another hard drive to store all pictures you want.</seg>

<seg id="1025">Each object has a visible level. you can specify this value relative to the visibility level of the above property or as absolute value. objects will be displayed if they are selected or their visibility level or equal to the visible level of the scene in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window order than presetting. the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you do not like the default window order, or if you need another arrangement, you can easily set them anywhere. you can also save several window orders and simply switch between different orders.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To make a window over or under a present view, drag the beginner to the top or bottom edge of a view. a rectangle shows the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the beginner to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then anchored on the right or left side of this view and covers the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange several views over each other, drag the beginner to another view. you can then switch between the views by clicking on the boxes card reader above.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement is suspended views: views that are not enshrined in the main window. to solve a view from the fixing system, drag the beginner to the desk or click on the small pointing left at the Beginnbar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross in the Anfal Bar. to prevent the closing, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can add additional views in the main window. in the menu View you can find entries for any type of views. new views are floating, you can make it on any spot.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view can be saved with view window order. it will be shown a dialog where you can save the window order under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can render them renders. & kpovmodeler; 3.1g for rendering, this program must be installed properly. as this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5 currently. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To rendering the current scene, click the icon of Renders on the toolbar or select the menu entry option.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A Render mode corresponds to the entries in & Povray; s INI files. it determines the image size and quality of rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels you can insert arbitrarily many Render modes, from a fast preview up to full quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the icon The Render settings in the toolbar or in the menu View... select, the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each Render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but a name that can recognize the characteristics of mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the map size you can register the width and height of the rendered image. if you only want to rendering a small area of the image, select the check box and enter the image cut into the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In combination-field quality you can select the features, the & Povray; for rendering. this is used by a very simple colour and light model to a model with complex diffuser retro-illumination. a detailed description of the Render features can be found in the user manual and Povray;</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is rendered by only a ray of pixels, you can create different errors. these pictures often have a Moirè pattern or step-effects in curves and lines, plus details are not displayed if they are smaller than one pixel. this effect is aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of this error. in general, pictures with this property is better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you turn off anti-aliasing, calculates & Povray; more than a beam per pixel. this technique is called super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as a standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursively because each pixels is again divided and adaptive because the retracsioning depth depend on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you select the first method, POV-Ray traceases a ray of pixels. if you adjust the difference between pixels using a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling, if you adjust the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 is calculated using an extra value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays each.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff (r 1 -r 2) and abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference between the shades is divided, then the pixel is divided into 4 subpixel, which will be pursued individually and checked on further subdivision. the maximum depth of records can be set to the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another possibility to reduce aliasing effect is the creation of smokers for the beam process, called Jittering. if you turn Jittering, changed & Povray; the rays to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The latest setting for quality of the renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; the diffuse light reflectance is calculated. it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this card map you can adjust whether the alpha channels are to be calculated using POV-Ray. one pixel is then transparent if the corresponding Rays have no object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Open a new window for displaying the & Povray; account issue. if & Povray; unexpectedly, you can find the reason here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import an & Povray; scene, select the menu entry file importing and select a file in the dialog window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently, & kpovmodeler; not yet the full command of & Povray; if when importing error messages or warnings, a dialog window displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not want to use source text in & kpovmodeler; import this source between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can extract objects from the object tree into the editor to import the source text for & Povray; to import objects in the editor to import objects into the scene, select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copying and insert in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor, you can also add Source for & Povray; also in your editor.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; a scene will render. usually this povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on the own website, click & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; a user documentation to the displayed object. set here the path to your retention and version. the versions 3.1g and 3.5 will be supported.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (for example height level data) in the paths to the & Povray; -Libraries. if you are not in the folder of the scene, you must enter the path to these files here. if a file is found in different path of the library, the first found file will be used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for displaying the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">Colour to control points. the second color is used for displaying the selected checkpoints.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the visual field in the camera view and in the window type plate.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can adjust the object of points to the grid in the context menu of wire-model views. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and turns.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values indicate an accurate wire model and thus a better sewing unit for the displayed objects require more time to rendering. for some objects, such as the sphere, you can set the detail level for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you are looking for extended projections for extended projections, all the projections are further divided into the camera, all projections are used. advanced projections are all projections with exceptions to perspective and vertical projections. this property makes a better approach to projections, but requires more time to rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you cross the wall, a wall is mounted behind the objects. the wall is displayed in a box pattern of two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1069">If you cross the ground, a floor below is mounted under the objects. the floor will be displayed in a box pattern of two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you activate channel glasses, the non-recursive antialiasing method for the rendering of the scenes is used. the values for depth and swelling can be set. precise information on parameters can be found in the Section Render modes.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can modify existing window orders or create new window orders. in the section window orders will explain how to create and store window orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The combination-panel standard configuration: shows all existing window orders. & kpovmodeler; used the chosen window order at the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list Exhibitions are showing all existing window orders. a new arrangement can be created with the button and removing a selected arrangement with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Any window order is identified by the name. the name must be clear and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below shows all views of the chosen window order. new Views can be created with the button and removing selected views with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with Neue column, create a new column on the right-hand side of the existing window, with unmatched window, you will receive a cartcard view with the previous view and encapturing a view of the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you have just & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; and now you want to follow any more accurate knowledge of both programs. if you can follow all steps in this tutorial, you should make the ultimate but simple scene under beginners: a ball on a plane.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should make the following warning: before you can complain that you only use a black screen. if you use a 3D program for first time you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not adjust the camera, no rules can be applied to the rendering, as a result you get a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you don't insert a light sources, your entire scene is in the dark and you will receive only a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have any error-free installed, see the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following pre-installed window order:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to meet the menus and the existing symbols of the toolbar. read the documentation that you can expect a reasonable presentation, what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols frequently, so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this tutorial, you must first remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the menu entry dialog. thus you have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wireless model view shows how the camera shows the entire scene you create. in particular, note the scene from the camera view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the viewpoint of the camera. this shows the result of the scene of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the designation camera. if you click on it, see the contents of the object properties that find the various parameters of the camera. in the user documentation to & Povray; you will find further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change anything at the basic settings of the camera, this is later instructions, but note that the camera will change into the control points, with which you can change the camera point of the camera. simply click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you press the knob or the input button, the wire views and the object tree can immediately change according to these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the camera view.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the ground for the scene. for example, you could set a quader (Insert Body) and size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is an incomprehensible method for the solution of this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually, it offers a simpler way. you can use an infinite plane than floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the plain in the object tree, change the name and press the button on user or input button. in the object tree the new name is displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire-model view also shows the plain, even at the moment only a limited level. when you rendering the scene, the plane extends to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you can see the object tree accurately, you will notice that you can click the entry + before the object. in this case you can see the options for any new object: scaling, rotation and shift. select one of these options, also change the possible settings in view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the horizon line, so that you should know some of these parameters. select shifting and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">Choose the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose a bit multiple.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases a dialog opens in which you can choose to select how the object is displayed. you can change the name in the property panel (name = bottom-pigment), with a click on the button preview see how pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of the pigments only shows a matte black material, because you can always check the appearance of materials any time with a click on preview. give now the colors for the pigment one. too, there's many possibilities now, but take it now the simplest.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you are looking for a preview no color on Quader and Ball, click on the knob and call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now correct. if you render your image now with a click on the icon, you should receive the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course you are not the color list. you are still necessary further settings. in the colour list you need to enter two new attributes. then, select this entry twice (you can also do it more frequently, but the chess board color list can only be used only with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">Select in the object tree every time and change the colours in the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step, you should already simply execute the basic workings of & kpovmodeler; already, the ball can be just as simple as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In view of the object properties you can change the settings. set the value for the radius: to 1 (do not forget to push the input button or the button on the floor. otherwise, the ball would be suspended above the ground, as you have moved the bottom around a unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course the rendering is now a strange result: as already before, the ball-surface appears like a matte black material. set in the following step a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the sphere, you can now assign a material. as already on the ground, enter the ball a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select the most important accommodation project and change the name for example in sphere of pigment. click on the sphere of pigments, then choose one-colour and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve interesting effects if you take time to set some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values like in the following screen photos and click on user or press the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings of brightness and reflection have already revealed good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metal: even not selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression what possibilities you have & kpovmodeler; hopefully you have already learned as much as you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracycing is a Render method to create a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you are a scene raytracing, the Renderer hypothetical rays coming from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera that illuminates the scenes) by any pixels in the scene. the Render will act and broken the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how the atmospheric effects will work as the example of fog. so the scene pixels is processed for pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will see nothing to see the camera with which you see the scene. without a light source you can see nothing, the picture is simply black. obviously, every scene need to be locked, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file selection you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the default file you can select a file you have previously tested with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you can open a new model or create a new model, the file will be inserted into this sub-menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">Have the model already stored, it will be stored under the same name. if it's a new file, you must enter a name and one space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">The scene in the last stored version recovered. all changes since the last storage will be rejected.</seg>

<seg id="1120">Repeat the last modified command. select this menu entry you can only select if you have to use Edit menu.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Saves the current window order and opens a dialog in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or an existing arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu, you can find options for the setting of & kpovmodeler;, here you can change the appearance, the key root and the default behavior.</seg>

<seg id="1124">Opens up a dialog for setting up the toolbars. you can add toolbars for & kpovmodeler; commands Add and remove.</seg>
<seg id="1125">One Bump-map is a way to allow harsh surfaces without changing surfaces, without changing the geometric shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file to use a Bump-map as well as for a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic body are simple geometric shapes that can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens of dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies. these models will continue to be machined to give them a realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a possibility to give the surface of an object color on pixel-basis, by application of a picture file as colour card.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a comfortable image viewer and browser. the application features a file browser where you can select images to display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed in an own window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuickshow; is very simple. the file browser lists files that you can click with click on & LMBn; or the return key.</seg>

<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the command line options of Qt and & kde; in addition, Amarok still supports some of its own command-options options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give a feedback if the script can't be executed due to a lack of dependency. please check in your script if all the required modules are available and use dialog when the user does not run.</seg>

<seg id="1187">In the file scripts, you can use a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use it as a basis for your own scripts, or simply expand the required functions. you will soon determine that the letter from scripts is relatively easy.</seg>
<seg id="1188">Using DCOP, your scripts can exchange data with Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is to use the command dcop; which should defeat any KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripts themselves enable the result of external programs and commands. in this way, dcop &gt; can be called relatively easy. here, an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& amarok; sends alerts to all current scripts. in this reason, scripts were able to monitor their standard entries and respond correspondingly to events. of course, a script can also ignore the events when there is no use.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure the script to display the setup dialog. to store the store and loading of the setup data must take care of each script. if a script is started, Amarok sets the work folder to the folder where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange is signalized that a new piece will be played. the script could now be & zb; with DCOP-functions further information on the new piece (for example, the metadata or the unit length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Volume Change of newvolume signals a modification of the volume. the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Customised MenuClicked: - Includes the path to the selected files of the playlist, if a custom menu entry can be used. to add an entry file, you can use the DCOP-function dcop amarok script addCustomMenuItem (submenu) to remove dcop amarok script-eCustomMenuItem (Submenu).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & amarok; terminate or if the user will stop a script, send & amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed to do. for example, saving data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amarah script administration can also install script packages that can be compressed using the user & zb; such packets can be compressed using bzip2 (.bz2) that the user can clearly recognize the archive using bzip2 (.bz2) so that the user can clearly recognize the archive as Amarok-script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& amarok; 1.3 will accept only script packages with the expanding amarocscript. for this reason, you should rename your script packages immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main crept must be executable (+ x), the rest of the ladling modules should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to obtain the file rights:</seg>

<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP-interface of & K3b; features such as copyCD, format DVD and further functions for creating new projects.</seg>

<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXX Project method you can generate a DCOP-reference to the newly created project: # K3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project can be generated using # dcop K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3bInterface currentProject By using this reference is it possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b features the K3bProjectinterface on the top of the K3bProjectinterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectinterface which is only applicable to data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Station createFolder (QString name, QString Parent) - addresl (KURL:: List URLs, QString Parent). the QString Parent (QString Leent): the QString Quartet (QString path, QString newname).</seg>
<seg id="1492">So it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders and then add files into the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / Bash PROJECT createFolder test dcop $PROJECT createFolder boo dcop $PROJECT createFolder Bar / foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder / foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder / -file.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudiocreator; is an audio CD; you can easily read audio CD; s read and saved in MP3- or OGG files. also other formats are possible depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudiocreator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (compressed). currently, lame are supported for MP3, oggenc for OGGs and FLAC (default free compression). additional coals can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the titles of the & CD; read and then stored in WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these WAV files (usually one per title) are compressed into MP3- or OGG format or in other formats like the lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading & CD; is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia is used. almost any distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not installed, this has to be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), ogg until (for OGG) or other Kodiers are already installed. however, all these programs are usually being installed for any Linux distributions. however, only the costly packets must be installed which is used. if FLAC is not used, its installation is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1500">What should be used for encoding / file format? chapter Which codes are a small introduction over Kodiers, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copy protected audio CD; s: as already said, uses & kaudiocreator; this program is not possible to read any copy protection. if not the firmware of the & CD; / DVD device is not possible to avoid any copy protection; even does not avoid the mechanisms of copy protection. avoid using copy protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While the setup must be performed only once again (the setup dialog can be called so often), the daily handling of a & CD is explained. this leads (hopefully) to understand the slim approach of user interface, which you will be proud to be proud in the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert in many formats - depending on which code programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can get & CD; information from freedb from the internet or can work completely without a network, whereby all these can be recorded manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is only a short list of commands of the main window. on the page step for example, there are more information about how this program is used as well as pictures of the registration maps for the configuration of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">Starts the CDDB request of CD data subject to the setup of CDDB. (this may be locally or online, in the latter case first the connection to the internet is required.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Start reading and - if a encoder is configured in tab code settings in the setup dino - the coding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a sub-menu with a list of available Encoder, so that the selection can be read from any other encoder as the standard. it is to be aware that before the encoder is configured in tab code settings in the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager, so you can read and encode a full file instead of a full & CD; read and read.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of alerts (such as protocols, Pieptics) for Programs (such as read & CD; finished).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main setup dialog of & audiocreator; with different cartons (such as Encoder, to set the Encoders). here you have to go before the program can be successfully used!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes clay quality, coaster and compression ratios and helps you to choose the right Kodierers.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is lost, a loss free audio format is needed. in addition to FLAC there are other such as' hormone 'or' Monkey ', which may also be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are low compression ratios and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats, the information through data compression depending on their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG is the most common. OGG likes today have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bitrate, the differences are less important because both codiers produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'not so 'free, lame is still delivered with most distributions as free, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high to very high sound quality (at high bit rates), but compared to OGG slightly deeper quality when lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is heard from one computer or a computer-based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG playback devices are present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - If music is also heard on other devices, such as standard DVD player, portable devices (USB Stick, memory card, hard drive) or special auto-stereo modes. today - initially, these tools usually support both the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list with parameters on the audio quality and the compression ratios for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the most</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer for most people and most music tracks acceptable, and has quite high quality. good enough for stereo audio systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 up to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and some less for less complex parts of the unit. good enough for stereo audio systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. do always need 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for stereo audio systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h' = 128 kbps CBR joint stereo, compression rate of about 11. 128 kbps for all pieces of a titels. good comug to music by adolescents, portable devices and ergostereosystems. but not good enough for stereo HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting is exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have the absolute highest quality, then choose this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information, manually entered or by the program automatically from the freedb via the Internet, are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can pass / used with & kaudiocreator; and the code program to create folder and file names as well as the characteristics of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with coding programs, there is frequently a combination of programming settings for the coals and these parameters. the manual or assistance to Kodiers explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add the & CD; titles to the keyword (English: tag) if MP3s must be encoded with lame, the switch-tt of lame and the title parameter is added by & kaudiocreator; the result looks like: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & audiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button-drawing in the assistant):</seg>
<seg id="1530">That is what the freedb is: a free database to read / enter the information can be downloaded / enter, so that all other information can download instead of yourself into the calculator. it's note that here only text is spoken: & CD; title, artist, names of pieces & etc;, not by the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (note: this is the author) I am not attorney. however, nobody can choose from the & CD; more or less valuable, so it can't be added to the artist nor the music company damage. all information can be saved in a bummel by a & CD; business, physical or virtuell.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & wiocreator; is active a check box (sending one address). in this type of configuration, it seems that the e-mail address is not used when calling the data from the server (This can only know the programmer that has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are in many countries copies of the main database. if & kaudiocreator; for use of freedb, the geographic on next mirror server is needed. this saves bandwidth in the network and resembles the load between the machines.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freed.org provides a current list of reflections for the online retrieval of & CD; information during reading a & CD; alternatively, the whole database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">What reading program is used around pieces from the & CD; stored in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There is rumors that cdparanoia is used to search in the source code.... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD; see note that the cdparanoia package from the appropriate distribution must first be installed, if this is not done.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To store the stored WAV files, the Kocher and so the desired file format is chosen. during the opening time you will find predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (one lossless compression for audio data) on the tab for setting up the body. other Kodiers can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodierer package must be installed from the appropriate Linux distribution before the coals may be used. for the predefined coders, this is also necessary for the predefined coders. more information on Kodierer are in the chapter of the Kocher.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installation of a codiers, more information on his switches can be received by the input of a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console). 'lame' will be replaced by the name of the installed Kodierers.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This may have many causes. check the device of device drawing of the & CD; / DVD drive, the write and reading of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, FLAC & etc;). try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal. that might indicate what is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want to read a copy protected audio CD; check the shell & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with one step for step example. even if you use other settings, you can give this tips as you need to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the full manual, everything understood, but somehow still unsafe something to do? well, no problem, follow this step-step example, and you'll get enough information to create those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, all in one and our first & CD; we will be able to use MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3v1 sample (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">You have to be installed cdparanoia and lame have already been installed on your computer. both programs should be found as a pre-compiled package for your Linux distribution as it is considered not completely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd insists that you own write permission (eg; by clicking on the cross-cross section).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section deals with basic setting of & audiocreator; something which is probably done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the lecture of a & CD; which must be repeated for each out & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the compression factor for the compression of the music (lame) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 up to 256 kbps), where the files are stored and the structure is used to use the program to use the freedb to download the & CD; data from the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change with any reading & CD; when once the matching settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name will be delivered to the reading program, so it can read the & CD; -data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Frequently / dev / cdrom a symbolic link to the real device-drawing of your drive. if this is not working or if more than a & CD; / DVD drive can also be accessed. if on the drive with other programs can be accessed, so a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt by using existing entries of the device drawings for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The card ticket General Settings. here is not much to do. here you can define an additional conversion. in our example everything will be shown as shown in the screen photo.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only in case of incomplete information, so you will be informed if data are missing when creating keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card CD; -Settings. simply select both entries. we are convenient and allow the & CD; Download data automatically via the Internet from a freedb computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the calculator must be connected during the read of the & CD; it may be connected to the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection field is easier, a & CD; entry is found immediately, if you're unhappy with the database entry and the resulting directory names / file names, or tag entries, you can easily changed. the directory or filename is changed with conquint- &gt; rename and the ID3 tags with Kid3, dem & kde; tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from that example, please note: if you want to enter all manually, then disable the selection fields and freedb is not used. however, this is worthwhile twice if this is worthwhile. to freedb in offline mode, the two selection fields must be selected, at least the first. the mode is set up on the following card chart.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is for us freedb. these are the information available on the Internet. how white the system, which data can be received from the freedb server? read the section about freedb. put everything as shown in screenshot photo.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we did not download the database we want to work with remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to freed.org and look after a mirror server in your proximity. on this way the load is distributed between the machines. however, this setting will work as first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work as equal as the server, as many Firewalls will boot the protocol 8880, there may be more lucky with the protocol 80 because it is open & HTTP; protocol usually open to surf the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we want to deliver a & CD; data to the freedb server is to disable the first check box.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the settings from screenshot. (make sure that the folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneously running pieces: sorry, there is a reason why more than one at the time when using existing drive? parallel reading and coding? the author doesn't know, so easy to try.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last piece: cross it in order to throw out the & CD; at the end of the trial.</seg>
<seg id="1567">User-defined file for temporary files: if you are crossed, then the path / folders can be stored in which the WAV files can be saved. if the field is not crossed, the box will not be crossed, if you don't want to make this folder when you want to make something with the WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">All in such as it is displayed on screen photo. the command is somewhat long, under circumstances you need to see something to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of MP3s. as previously mentioned, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good stereo stereo audio systems. it's a compression factor is 6.3 to 256 kpbs. that reached compression factor 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Notice the entry '--id3v1-only' for the restriction of the generation of tags to version V1 / V1.11. 'ID3v2' tags can also be deleted as needed. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tagger for & kde; in case of later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the names of the procedure (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Put the rest as in screen photo. some comments for future use except this sample:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously encoded WAV files: with a Dualcore or Quadcore or even a multiprocessor machine can be tried to encode more than a WAV file simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1573">This is it, we have just finished the basic device of & audiocreator; this configuration is used as standard for any reading & CD; if you have chosen the organisational structure of your music, you never need them to change.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section it is described how the process runs out and set up on the hard disk. initially we will build MP3 files. first, a connection to the internet is being built, as we are convenient and the & CD; the process of which is described in this section must be repeated for any outgoing & CD; this section has to be repeated.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD; you will not see the screen photos a little different from as the for a & CD; with successfully by freedb unclaimed data. therefore, you will learn the & CD; data can be manually sent instead of the Internet. comments are displayed on the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Don't try the & CD; this example is a 'special' edition of the author of this handbook.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not done, then the & CD must now be defined in the drive that has been defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and its length should be listed in the window, such as the screen photo. this only if the & CD; identified as audio CD; identified and can be identified by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not happening, you are looking for questions or answers after the help or go back to the preceding section regarding the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD can be collected from the freedb, all tracks are already completed and in addition, the name of the artist and the album are shown.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the case there is more than an entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; key for your & CD; there will be a window, and you can select the database entry, that fits your opinion on your & CD's best.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you do not select the check box for automatic retrieval of freedb (on the page & CD; -settings in dialog for Settings), you can also select this manual by choosing the first button in toolbar. if you do not have local database, but need the data from the Internet, you need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 02: CD editor - Input of CD data and Titels of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Specify the data for your & CD; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen photo. the title of the piece in the first line of the 'refreseller title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist does not have to be entered in the input field "Update", unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower comment field can be used for the individual comments inidips per piece, the comment field of the album is used for comments common to all the pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful retrieve of the data from the freedb, the CD editor is not empty, but it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor, so that you can not only start with the artist and album names (e.g. if all words with case letters are beginning or not...), but also to prove if there are any unwanted remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we use only ID3v1-tags: for the artist, album and title of a piece and at only 28 characters for the commentary area. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least to what & kaudiocreator; maximum allowed. this option is set up on tab code code settings; take a look at the 'basic settings'.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files later anytime with tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files with it, you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags will not be supported by all Kodiers or file formats. see the help for Kodiers to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry to coincide with the style of the issuing CD; in this example this is not important because we can't support the & CD; data for more information go to the website of freed.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example can be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' you come back to the main window. just click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD-Editors appears again and you can see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we need for the first piece. just enter the entries for the current piece. the titles of the piece in any case and other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click the next line in the main window and process it down to the same way until you have entered all the title data of the & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window will not appear when you downloaded the data from freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album can be displayed on the piece list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check-in before any number of a piece. only the tracks are selected, or simply click on the line switches the selection of the piece, or simply select the button All pieces select at the bottom edge of the screen to select all the pieces at one time.</seg>
<seg id="1598">By clicking on the button selection read the reading process, this window appears to confirmation. click OK and then we will see a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the rider orders to switch on the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly under the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control the orders. the first piece is just read on the hard disk. the status of the program is displayed in the lower part of the window in the status line.</seg>
<seg id="1601">These error message you see if you are trying to work with a coals you do not have installed. pieces that were not successfully coded with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the file for the tmp file and the target folders are not what we have entered in this example. have you checked if you have a write access to the folder for temporary files and target folders?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the reading of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it's finished. but we have a new entry: job 4 is the coding of pieces 1 into the format MP3. so you can read and encode parallel. note the status of the window in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has not found any configuration settings to read and encode the number of parallel processes to read and encode. with powerful machines, the machine with an AMD64 seems no problem when simultaneously read and encode (of however two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read, while another piece is encoded, and a third order is encoded in the waiting-long of the Kodierers. after the last piece is coded, a little window will end with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & audiocreator; you need & kde; 3.x resp. 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG, you will need the code of your choice.</seg>

<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizer, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the LUP driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can open... from the menu File menu. the usual file dialog appears with which help you select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also have a file from a & conqueror; -window to the & kmid; -window will drop. this also works with multiple songs at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open the button and get the button to play in the toolbar, select the entry to play out of the menu piece or run the empty box.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; one piece will automatically start, as soon as you will drag it to the & kmid; -window will be added to a collection and then play another one after another.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & kmid; one piece plays, you can jump on any spot by using the middle mouse button and drive with the knob and drive.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song can be played quickly or too slow, you can click the arrows on the left and right of the template. to get back the original pace, double click on the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The Leertaste has two tasks: if a piece is played, a pressure on the empty-button appears like a pressure on the button break or the select of the menu entry rest in the menu piece, so that playback is played during no piece, starts & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored in one piece of music. some pieces use textures, other use lyrics and again other both. some pieces have no text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can adjust what events will be presented automatically and even better: the event type will automatically be used, so that you can manually adjust the karaoke text. however, you still have the opportunity to change this if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set an event type, choose from the menu settings the entries of textures or corsetments. the same function also have the keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you can summarise. these will be used in line with this section as you can use collections.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you will find in the menu collection under the item.... Click there on New and give the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy a existing collection by clicking on copying and then add the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs like the original.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than a collection, you can set the desired categories in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">In the temporary collection all songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application, this collection is not stored. consider that if you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, you need to add to the collection manager. there you can add a song using the button. it appears again the file dialog, with which help you select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on the setting Automatic add to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic add to the collection is enabled, a piece when opening (using file opening or drag & drop) automatically added to the active collection.</seg>
<seg id="1643">If Automatic is not activated to the collection, when opening a piece, the temporary collection is enabled and reealed. this collection will then be added to open pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click removing.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can choose the order that will be played in the songs. if you select the sequence of the menu collections, the songs were played in the order, as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add songs or remove or random order in the menu, the order is set to be set.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager or use the selection list above the Karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump a song, select the next song next song from the menu piece or press the button arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump back a song back to jump, select the button of previous piece, the entry previous piece from the menu or press the arrow to the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection and click on the button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">Temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, that doesn't matter, since it is not stored when leaving & kmid; not saved.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is strictly necessary for synthesizers, which are not General MIDI-compatible. in this case, the MIDI-Map General-MIDI events in events that synthesize the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI card which converts the patch patch patch to Bright piano in events of the change patch patch to Trumpet and thus always enables trumpet to play if originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have only a sound card you do not need MIDI-Map because all the sound cards are GM compatible (including Awe - and GUS-cards, FM radio and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are unfortunately no programs to create MIDI maps, so you need to edit the appropriate file from hand (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-Map is a text file that allows all necessary modifications to the playing of a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Every section may appear only once, except the KEYMAP section which may appear as often as desired. however, requires that every occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END define the Keymap "Name of the Keymap"... END define a further Keymap... END define... END options... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that define it is necessary to indicate that a section starts (except for options) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your Map file as an e-mail, so I can support you in future versions of & kmid; support for devices that are not General-MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section it is indicated like the patches of General MIDI to your specific keyboard. the general use looks as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equilateral is ignored. it is assumed that the GM-patches must be in the right order (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order and no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllkeysTo M is used to lay all sounds which require this instrument to put it on the tone with the number M. if your keyboard is not supported for example (eg, sound 60), you can add a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which allows the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So now a MIDI file should play a note with patch 127 (Gedefy), it takes Patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of what sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here is meant with the term drum Patch-patch which is meant with each tone a different perpercussionary instrument (drum, basins, maracas & etc;) and not the one that means the tone the sound height of the always same drum (like some keyboards).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is used to indicate how sounds are shown on a certain channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As in the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as well as their presence. you need to create 128 items.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keymaps for each channel and instrument. you only need to use in the first line of different names.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are mainly used to monitor tones on the perussions channel. check out as an example of the keyboards delivered.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to form some channels to others. if you want to exchange some channels on others. if you want to exchange the first and second channel, make it simply in the CHANNELMAP -section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards which have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI to channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is depicted on the channel N. if you use the keymap option to use the keymap using the name name for this channel. if you are using the Forcepatch option, all events will continue to change the patch on this channel. in this case you will always use Patch x.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Forcepatch option can be useful for example to use the perkussions patch on the perussions canal.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for Pitchflag ratio can be multiplied, in which ratio Pitch-Bender event is transmitted using the value n, this is done with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then the value 4096 is used to be used in the map file is no decimal occurrence.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM is needed that a keyboard, which is to play a pitch benchmark. unfortunately, try some keyboards to play two sounds up to one octave. in order to find the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI-Map, simply open the dialog MIDI settings. you can find in the menu below settings, point MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole number of pianos (one for each MIDI channel). on these connectors you can see which sounds are just played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel, there is a selection list where you have changed a instrument, the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no more the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (until now) two different views to display the played tones. view in the Settings menu under the point channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The pace LCD shows the speed to be played with which one song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the pace of a couch. if you find, a song be too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the pace, use the arrows left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file containing information about how a piece of music must be played. it contains notes, the rhythm, speed, & etc; so it can result the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results, just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can force niemboingen, & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while a mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc; you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This may happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) of & kmid; have happened because & kmid; without AWE support, you need to download and install a source distribution (for example of kmid; 's home).</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all files separately.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agree, it supports & kmid; drag & drop. simply open the folder you want to add & conqueror; select all files, and drag them to the & kmid; -window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">In advance, activate the option Automatic add to the collection. otherwise the files are added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can check the arrow button on the left from Tempo- LCD to slow playing. to restore the standard tempo you can click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have on a & kde; -Desktop a & conqueror; -window with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this mode I must play if the collection is played at the end or I want to play a file, merely go to the & conqueror; -window change and drag the desired file into the window of & kmid;</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen to a file if you want to add a file without having equal to a collection, turn the option Automatic add to the collection, and the new; file will be added to temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">For example, suppose you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. one only want to play the first file. so, set the option editing the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly these a MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then unlock, also B.mid and C.mid can play and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">Those people listened to me MIDI files or postcards. all thank you! if I see these songs or the postcard, animate me that, next to & kmid; to program me.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; from Maas; Laga. at the moment I'm not much free time for my hobbies, but I'm trying to take a bit of time. as Hobbies I program programming, MIDI files, music and phrases.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where you can download MIDI / karaoke files if you want a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; have, or even if you simply want to make me happy, write to me a e-mail: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrais.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really want to send me a huge anticipation when you send me a postcard from your residence or a MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. if you want to send a postcard or a MIDI file, you should get in contact with me when I've got a file, since I might have a file.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have & kmid; completely renovated in my free time and I would like to emphasize the money. I therefore want to record it because / if I get feedback from users (postcards or emails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - Keep the error that the pitch was too high for AWE cards.</seg>
<seg id="1700">My thanks also Jose Lus Sanchez for the testing of the AWE support, Ignacio Bieker, Peter Grass, Magnus Grass, Peter Grass, Peter Grass, Peter-Paul Witta, Thorsten Westhete, Ulrich Cordes and everyone who sent me a patch, a fault contact or even only a supporter e-mail.</seg>
<seg id="1701">And of course my thanks also applies to all of these excellent musicians on the net, which give us these wonderful MIDI- and karaoke files.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In addition, & kmid can also be found on his homepage from http: / / www.arrais.es / ~ rlarrosa / kmid.html on the homepage you can view the development and look at the links to pages with other karaoke songs, & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer because the sound quality depends on your sound card. it is not the same if you use a FM radio or a AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you have no soundcard you have to compile & kmid; with the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL. it works as if you had a sound card, besides that you can't listen to music.</seg>
<seg id="1705">If you are problems, contact the & kde; -mailinglists or send an error message directly to me.</seg>
<seg id="1706">& kmPlayer; is a simple interface for MPlayer, Phono and FFMpeg. the program is used to play video files from the player or phono supported formats, as well as playback of DVD, VCD or TV and camera.</seg>
<seg id="1707">The documentation for & kappname; was not yet finished as & kde; on this computer was installed.</seg>
<seg id="1708">For additional help please check the page The KDE website to new releases, or send the question to The & kde; user mail list.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-known windows. there is always the window with the central view. alternatively, there is a window with the playlist. and finally, there is an information window that is displayed only when informations are returned.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to purchase the preferred connections under the menu bookmarks, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries, you should use the thumb playlist to each other, so you should use the thumb playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course you can add groups to groups to receive additional hierarchies. if you copy a entry, his group and all its subgroups to the current category is copied and playback starts with the clicked record.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current piece ', television and continuous playlist, can also be changed if you can only do if & kmplayer; not running through the application itself, but also through the application itself. simply click on a name of a category, select from the menu view and as next processing mode. by clicking a sub-group, only the XML content of this particle is shown.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you must select from the menu to the same playlist and select either the Edit Mode menu or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost when working mode or leave any other group without having left the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Due to the ease of the author of & kmplayer; some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files..</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation and loading can be deactivated by editing of ~ / .kde / share / mplayerrc and changing [General Options] No Intro = 0 obble option to '1'. if the option is not available, it can be easily inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate a different animation. & kmplayer; will notice the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / kmplayer / / .xml and ~ / .kde / vit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation at starting does not need to be short, it will automatically end automatically through opening another source. this would be annoying with the end animation, the user can therefore end the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of an start-animation may be the ad of a favorite photos: & lt; kill; & lt; b = / / / home / mum.gif "fit =" Meet, "; & lt; / smoothed; & lt; / smack; are in the directory tests / some examples of SMIL that are from & kmPlayer; are supported.</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a riders for configuring MPlayer in the configuration dialog of & kmPlayer; here you can set the path from the MPlayer and the intermediate memory size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the button 'console' in the toolbar of kmplayer. here the edition of mplayer is evident here.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no rider for this rendition in the configuration dialog of & kmplayer; everything must be configured by manual processing of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplaywype. here is an example of how a 'flash' with the module swab-Mozilla is played:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash' can be played within & kmPlayer; it can even be inserted the special box embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">In order to playback the & kmplayer; 'flash' in HTML pages must play the & kmplayer; module as a service provider for the Mime Type application / x-Shockwave flash will be given in the setup dialog file assignments by KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Konqueror or & kmPlayer; is in a console application to start and after error messages related to the loading of the browser module library. if there is no error, the backend output is within & kmplayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu to check).</seg>
<seg id="1726">So always a prefabricated backend is taken for a specific Mime type (of course only if this is also determined), this must be done by manual changing of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. for example, phonon all ogg files will be used:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& kmPlayer; can be used by TV cards, either by using MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer). before TV, you need to use the device and the TV channels. in addition, the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">To configuring the VDR (video data recorder) settings in the kmplayer is the dialog for Settings - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port. there should be ports detected, from which one is selected (e.g., it's PAL for West Europe), the correct name has probably contained a DVB input.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of kmplayer can only work XVideo, this type of playing video devices should work under Linux. this is also supported on the first screen (: 0.0). for the XFree86 server, this is necessary to do the following in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config).</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally, are used by KMPlayer for the sources of different names. at the time of this documentation, this dvdnavsource, source, pipesco, tvcode, tvcode, source code, vcdsource and vdrsource. if they are activated, they start playing the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Is there indications like I can make my CDROM drive quieter when I play from it (not by default: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the command hdparm -e 8 / dev / cdrom is due to be run as a user root after the integration of the device. it is absolutely secure to make / dev / cdrom the CDROM drive.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Xine starts slowly but why must my CPU be tested on their performance every time?</seg>
<seg id="1734">Note: the response is overtaking. kxineplayer automatically needs the last stored value, only the first time will check the CPU.</seg>

<seg id="1773">When using quotation, a selection list with literary entries is displayed. for the processing of & bibtex; files are appropriate editors. the author has good experience with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the & bibtex; -files can also be written in & kile; by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last selection field with the name GrÃ ¶ Ã ¼ e is used for the definition of the font. it is possible to define the font, which will be specified on the main text, the FuÃ ¼ chnotes, etc.</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & kile; two selection criteria are available: 1. the assistant for the creation of a new document by selecting the document type and celebration of settings. 2. the document cannot be written with the source.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The brackets for the command\\ Control class contain the settings for the command. setting [12pt] specifies the font. the font is not specified at the beginning, this can also be done in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">As soon as the above source text, the & latex has to be compiled. the simplest way to this is the use of the menu of construction or of the button.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source must be stored in front of the compilation. & kile; for storing the storage automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If you want to document the document, the document should be searched for errors. when using rapid construction, an eyepiece should be opened; this is not the case, the protocol should also be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1780">A environment (English. environment) is a text that is treated differently than the remaining document. for example, a report with the font is to be created. the command\\ Begin {Clean},\\ Control and\\ end {the surrounding of the font is to be added within the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The changes will only be adjusted within the environment (from\\ Begin {5} to\\ An (environment}). there is no exception (number of cases available within a surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many advantages for reading the reading and user friendliness of the document. it can be added to such fonts, liant pressure, cranial printing, submissions, etc. these commands are either with the command\\ or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ Begin {emap): this command is available for the cursiary pressure and is long as long until it is closed with a\\ end {emph} or another environment. a single word in a sentence can be represented by\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ Quote: created a quote in the document. the quote starts with\\ Begin {Quote} and ends with\\ 's {Quote}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background of writing the source text with & latex; labeling language was shown, now a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & kile;</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once in the assistant, a little text should be entered, a few adjustments should be accomplished for better read of the document. if a quote, a few points in the fat and cursiveness and a poem is to be used to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">As soon as the document was viewed, it can be returned to the editor or Strg E editor (at the internal viewer). at an external viewer the window will be closed.</seg>
<seg id="1788">As soon as the DVI / file created, the document can be printed or converted into a & PostScript; / PDF file. simply try and fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is a straight file format (English. D e V ice I nd). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for the readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output such as printer, & PostScript; / PDF file converter or computer monitors.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI file, the same steps as the creation of the document are available (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - then the document can be printed via file printing (if the printer is set properly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar uses the conversion of the DVI; file in other formats. as soon as the DVI; file from the & Latex; source code was created, the conversion in any other formats can begin by pressing the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The preview for you to find the direct jump from the editor to the matching position within the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& kile; offers a corresponding setting for all & latex; -Bind files. for this purpose, only Modern under Settings... Tools needed to be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1794">In order to expand the preview, the mouse pointer has to be positioned in a line of the source code and close to pre-search. the jump to the corresponding place in the DVI / viewer will then be done.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece; with one click of the middle mouse button on DVI; -document the corresponding & latex; -document by & kile; open & kile; in & eyepiece; available as text editor (attaching to eyepiece editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">In case of quick construction of the & DVI; slide viewer cannot be found, an error can be found. if an error occurred, this is displayed in the log file or the news window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The protocol file extends the error source in the source code. in the editor, the log file is always used between the errors. the protocol file is always used to consider the faulty line has to be clicked on the error in the journal, navigating to the defective line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">As soon as on the button in the toolbar, a window will be available for selecting the template for the document. the default settings are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">With a selection of empty document, a document may be written either from the ground or the assistant to create a new document. further information are included in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Users of & Latex; usually use the same introduction to virtually all documents. templates can be created, stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, you need to create an existing & tex; - / latex; file opened or a new file. & kile; can create a new template using an existing document and create selection of file template from document...</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document, a template may be replaced by other data (such as name or character encoding). these variables can be set up in settings... Settings and General settings.</seg>
<seg id="1803">As a result of creating your own template it is necessary to know what strings of which variables are replaced:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTMAROPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by entering in the document class. typically, it is used as follows:\\ Control Class [$$DOCUMENTMAROPTIONS $$] {$$] {article}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The simplest way to create a template is the use of the assistant and the result of the commands in the editor. as soon as the document created the following steps:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document then the own template can be balanced instead of the standard space.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files will be created in a simple way for creating a template, should be searched one on the Internet and the described below described below.</seg>

<seg id="1815">Many assistants can be found in the field of origin. these jumps is highlighted by an own kind of bookmarks within the text. the jumps stamp or the corresponding key figure will be highlighted the jump to the next or last jumping mark. this will also be highlighted the jump in the first input of a character.</seg>
<seg id="1816">The processing is probably one of the main aspects of using a program such as & kile; although & Kate; already outstanding features were added; & Latex; available always many environments and groups and therefore support different commands for their selection. under processing conditions, the following commands are contained in the text selection:</seg>

<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or automatically created from an existing DTD. see for details of converting.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how to create TagXML files, then the & descriptionrc; and also toolbars. short, one & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the Featuresdialoges, the & quantitative information; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. toolbars provide a fast insertion of tags in a document without any risk of any problem.</seg>

<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of TagXML on and declare whether they are necessary, or not. although not all are necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible, so many users have a better viewing and more information when working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limits are explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of an TagXML document. it can only contain once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but contains only element type itself, otherwise nothing else.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The tags is a script function. when using it & lt; attr &gt; an argument of the function. (family 2 only)</seg>

<seg id="2024">The & descriptionrc; file is just fairly simple and there is a editor that can be processed via DTD edit DTD settings. by editing an & descriptionrc; for a newly created & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; a simple & descriptionrc; should be created with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[General] version = use 1 for & quantitative; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD indication.

<seg id="2026">A action can be set up with settings.. Click on New action leads to the same dialogue:</seg>
<seg id="2027">This promotion is assigned a key root. with clicking on the User button, a key root can be assigned; with Kone, the current key root can be taken away.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The easiest actions. it can be entered into the detail settings and inserted in the execution of the promotion, this text is inserted at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. using the help of this promotion, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited), which will change or use as input (or parts of the document), the quick start-up dialog or the various refer to... promotions for the (X) HTML-DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">As first, the name of script and interpreter must be specified. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are permitted, it is recommended to use the% scriptiles variable in the command line; the script tries to find the script: global script file: $KDEDIR / share / apps / quantitative in their path: $PATH There are other special variable that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we replaced with the URL of the current documentation. in case of local document, file is removed: / from the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: will be replaced with the PID of the current & quantitative; only one instance will expire. this is useful if DCOP is used to control the PID number; this is useful if you use DCOP to control & quantitative; the external script will be used.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event normally, usually the file name of the current document or path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the above methods, a script can accept a script from & quantitative; at the default input. in the input field input can be determined, which is to be sent to the default value. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">For selected text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is normally meaningful only with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the issued application can also be redirected. there are two kinds of output: normal output written to the default error edition. it can be specified, which should be done with the default output written by the default output text:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are lots of tags in the markup language, it is recommended to create tags in logical groups. it is necessary to create a toolbar for each group. in given cases it is not too many, so you can create a tool bar using the name of the markups.</seg>
<seg id="2039">As soon as a tool bar is added, you must add your actions and configure the settings.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are fairly self-explanatory. press the New Aktion Knopsis at the bottom end of the window kicks off the editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill out all the required fields and add them to the appropriate toolbar to the corresponding toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete all and, if the Tag attributes has and you are planning to call the "Tag" day when available, so that an input when using the action is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is this a ugly icon. who should notice the action in connection with this symbol? replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">For creating a symbol that the action is better, we will use & kiconedit; use the & kmenu;, graphics other programs (or where else it is located in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; used as default 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol does not only help you understand what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to that the day of start, I decided to create a start button as icon. by using green (green becomes less, rigid, further interpreted), or should be signalized a message to the user that clicking on this symbol is a & lt; Started on; -day in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol, it is still to be connected to the action. this happens over the menu with Settings promotions... (in & quantitative;) and selection of the required action. in addition to the text box is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the stored icon is located, select it and confirm you with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the user button and continue with other tags, so it is that there or confirm you to complete with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to complement some usual & quantitative; functions for toolbar, or it should be divided for a better overview through some separators in several groups. set the toolbar set on settings toolbars. make sure the required toolbar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to select the separator (on the left above) for my tool bar. after the selection of the element that can be added to the toolbar, press the arrow button to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I would like to add a quick way to access the Konqueror preview. I'll select it and add to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the Trento support the group. someone who does not know my tool bar could believe that the & conqueror; -button the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by try all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Back in the correct folder. after reeXML not exists, it is put in the correct folder, but your tool bar (s) should be stored in the correct folder. please adjust your & descriptionrc; so that their tool bar (s) is loaded, if a file is opened from the appropriate type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the chosen expansion of & quantitative expansion; for the normal user is the option to add documentation for the script language or the formatting language you like to like. therefore, this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; document tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you may check in & quantitative; - Repository, if anyone has done this for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you have to search an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; language. then you need to create the docrc file. then we need to leave the docrc file. let us make the second part we cover here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc You = path, relative to this file, for example php42 / # elements in the main index top element = your description for these documentations e.g. & PHP; 4.2 Section Section 1 = page 1.html Section 2 = tag1.html tag2 = tag1.html tag2 = tag1.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, look at the & PHP; documentation as something:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE config file [Tree] Doc You = php42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 version = Table of Contents = index.html Getting Started = Guide,... introduction = Section.html... Language Reference = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = Bage.basic-syntaxes...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. that shows that there is sub-file in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the box office (except through the understanding) mdash, but try it out.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consistent, at the top end of the building life & mdash; file is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces influence nothing but keep on & and & lt; signs. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantitative; resourcendatry will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The section of this section is the range of docrc file, which is used to display the context of text and pressing Ctrl _ array function. by selecting the function called and pressures of Ctrl; H for context aid would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file connectors.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of separated separate context elements that should be available (for & PHP; these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc easily and from $HOME / .kde / share / apps / quantitative / apps for local or global use. then create a folder (as you have given this in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are certain that this well and it is worth, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. what documentation were used to use & quantitative; - Community. you will not be rich, but proud to be proud to have worked on the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantitative aplus, you are not alone. it is possible to divide resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or otherwise to whom will send an Email menu, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, send toolbar with email, in the context menu of files and folders inside the templates and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where all other & quantitative information can be downloaded and only available when our team needs them as correct and usefull for the publication. for a usefull contribution we recommend to use the resources for our team as well as for the later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you are asked for their private GPG key (the Passphrase will not be saved), or in the case that you have several key to enter the input fields (URL preview can remain empty) and with clicking OK the uploading is started.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can also be uploaded from the menus DTD DTD package (DTEP), toolbar toolbar, and in context menu of files and folders inside the templates and scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, even before installation, examines & quantitative assessment of the resource by examining the integrity and Signification. in the case of problems it warns and it may be canceled. if the integrity and the resource is signed, a message appears with the inscription of the owner of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML languages, which is currently not yet supported by & quantitative package, but creating a DTEP package. however, the preparation can be needed temporarily, because hundreds of day files could be necessary in tagXML format. there is the simpler way to allow DTD automatically into an DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the menu DTD load and converting an DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description which should be used. afterwards the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / quantitative / dtep folder.</seg>

<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: if enabled, brings & quantitative; according to the conversion and descriptionrc; Editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & Proaplus; there are some key concepts. to understand this and full advantage of & quantitative concepts. this chapter must first be entrusted with these fundamental concepts. this chapter tries to bring them exactly these concepts without their understanding & quantitative; little use.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & Proaplus; the workspace is divided into three areas: global, locally and projection. this differentiation is concerned with a number of components in & quantitative;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for each, the & conaplus; it uses, available. from toolbars over actions, everything is marked as globally, in the joint size structure of & quantitative information; this enables the group of administrators different toolbars, actions and patterns available in the global tree, which will be available to each in a multi-user environment at the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements provide a personal collection of web development for a single user. these are custom patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can use only this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Projections are only available within a specific project. this can be everything from & CSS; - patterns can be used specifically for the files of a specific project. simply said, this is the most restricted size. all elements are stored in the folder's folder of specialities and designs from all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantitative; -MDI; consists of several principal areas: the Editorwindow, the building views, the boxes with information and toolbars. please propose in, and for further information about these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click on the right mouse button to receive a context menu with the current documentation in order to recharge, delete or upload the document, jump or upload the document, jump to an bookmarks or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right in the editorial area, lead to another context menu regarding the revised documentation, such as basic processing steps (cut / copy / paste), processing of under the mouse pointer, or open the file, if the strings can be called a file under the mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the editor are the toolbars of the Editors. currently absorbs & quantitative; 4.01 Transitional has been shown as standard, for which a set of toolbars is shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantitative information, the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and therefore connected user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if you want to insert a single day, e.g. & lt; in their document, then click the icon to insert the day. now, you can insert the data for this straight day. if you want to insert a day that has several attributes (such as anchor), you can fill in a dialog for different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The construction views (QIT;) allow it to navigate to the information & quantitative information; in representation with cartographers are available for files, project, sample templates, documentation structure, scripts, attributes and documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that provides & quantitative information. this view shows all the files in the project and allows you to manage all files in the project using right mouse click. actions like adding, removing, uploading or delete files from the storage medium can be performed with the displayed context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of templates & quantitative; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc; It is possible to show you all options.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories, depending on which they are used. the category depends on & quantitative information. global templates are always available, local templates for users and templates are available in the project. more on templates are available.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information on the available scripts. the concept of reintegration in Global, Lokal and Project also works here. by clicking with the left mouse button you can call the available information to a script. about the right mouse button are available, such as the script to run, edit or send to email.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view, one shows the internal structure of the active document. through left-click of an element, the cursor is set to the position of the element. by right click of an element opens a list of commands to navigation and collection of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears below the other architectural perspectives. it allows you to change attributes and namespaces. this enables all the attributes of all available attributes with a few clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation on web technology for your development. there may be prepackaged documentation for & quantitative; the documentation site can be downloaded, and by adding a folder doc to a project can be selected, edit and viewed.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & conaplus; two carteivers at the bottom end of the window, can be reached via the useful information: the news window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This cartographer shows information about each in Quanta running script. for example, the DTD of the current document and all changes to the DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This cartographer shows all error in the markup of current documentation. & quantitative information, scripts that are carried out, give all error messages (as it is) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantitative aplus; toolbars are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they get the appropriate command. the chocolate page is the possibility to define own commands as symbols in & quantitative;</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantitative aplus; is the ability to send a toolbar to your mail. & using a tool bar via e-mail; if you receive a toolbar in an email, you can secure them in & quantitative; such as any other secure and load!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the location of & quantitative information. for this, autoconf has access a number of options that can be delivered to the Web script. to get a complete list of all options, type / configure. the options are simple to understand and not run here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems with start & quantitative; you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 am file. also you should make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 in the PATH in front of their bin folders. same applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& Proaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE-surface. & Proaplus; has been optimized for rapid Web development and combines a mature development environment with a wide range of powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2107">During work, the best & HTML; editor began to create, the developers of & quantitative idea began to deal with a obvious, extended markup languages editor now? well, this would be the absolutely great Web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer on pure & HTML; limited, is & quantitative; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. if you can define it in & XML; then it should be & quantitative; therefore, the appropriate & IDE;</seg>

<seg id="2114">& quantitative; is currently developed and supervised by Eric Laffoon Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amana @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files that you have opened. this list changes every time when you open a file, which is not taken out when the oldest entry is taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">That allows you to save the code parts and complete files as templates for the later use. check in the Section on templates. should you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project management tool, only a mistake will be reported.</seg>

<seg id="2123">Delivery and Switching of the problem reporters at the bottom edge of the & quantitative; main window. the problem reporter is activated, once you change to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Shows the symbolic content of the main window. this column allows you to set up with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">When there are bookmarks in the current file, you will be appearing in the menu together with the entries previous or next chapter, depending on the position of cursor in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other open documents appear in the menu grouped according to the file names of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens a existent project from the hard disk. & quantitative information projects are stored with the Extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. select the selected files then to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searched the project directory to new files that could be there. that allows for copying video files in your project folder or folder and add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Loads the files in your project on the server. the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of & kde; and if you have downloaded additional inputs / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Attitudes, such as & quantitative; the project manages. chapter & Proaplus; projects are explained for details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Loads a project tool. these are kept in the Project You / toolbar and are available in this menu when you have assigned them this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbar. allows you to select the type of toolbar: local or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. it creates only the name. actions you need to be stored using settings. toolbars are saved via toolbars or you are asked when asked if you want to save the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a toolbar from the field of view. the deletes it not from the hard drive. if you have not yet saved the toolbar, you will be asked if you want to do this.</seg>
<seg id="2136">So you can send your own toolbar to someone (maybe to the & quantitative information; -team, so the toolbar will be present in the next publication). the menu item will open a new email message with the toolbar as an appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Enables the uploading of toolbars to the main server, where any other can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Load an & DTD; you can convert or anything else has to convert and convert into the & quantitative; own label format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Load / refresh of the realities from the & DTEP; is meaningful if the realities from the & DTEP; to renew the whole & DTEP; to renew. if this global is and a write permission in the global KDE file is not present, charging the load.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded toolbars. if the standard (HTML;) toolbar is loaded, there is a menu menu which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current tag dialog when there is one. this entry is always available in menu tags, followed by & DTD; -specific submenu.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activating or Off the intelligent insertion of tags. currently this works only with (X) HTML DTDs. intelligent insertion means that & finaplus; the insertion means using toolbar if this day contradict the rules.</seg>

<seg id="2153">But this should be a help according to the mouse pointer, but it is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& Proaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed it, but like with any open source project, developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantitative; -development in financial form you will find here the way.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be completed best from top to bottom, as for example, after filling the project called the whole directory structure for the rest of the project will automatically be completed later with Shift; F7 Project Properties can be set later.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example foo. when entering the name, file will automatically be filled automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantitative; -project file. by default, it has the name of the project in small letters and without spaces with the extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here is the server address of the machine to which you want to access local data. either a name (hostname.exempl.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you empty this field empty, the default settings of the selected log file can be used. depending on the setup of the remote computer, a adjustment may be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where templates are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and as standard templates. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standards.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where toolbars are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and as standard toolbars. if a common collection of files used for different projects should be set instead of the standards.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from the local file system into the project. multiple files or whole folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change. by serverside scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you must proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Pact if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project, should be mounted. if a project is started on new, do not start.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders are displayed inside the main folder and you can make an exact selection according to expertise.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. you can select the required files by plugged in or by removing the tick, clamps out of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The latest screen of the new project assistant contains three settings that can simplify your work. these settings can also be uploading in the menu tree in the subwindow profiles or with a button Shift; F7.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings are in the project assistants and are described in detail. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of file names (placeholder possible), which will be relocate in schedule operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Complementary option to the top, also files that are listed in .cvsignore are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which will be loaded with opening the project, can be read more about the projection screen.</seg>
<seg id="2172">You can select the desired debug. currently only Gubed is supported. more information on Gubed can be found in. the debugger plugin can be set using the button options. in addition, troubleshooting is described.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the subwindow profiles can also instantly upload high-ladeprofiles (see in), as well as the display of a construction view for the content of the server for each profile by taking a own architectural view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the subwindow team configuration, project members can be added, processed or deleted as well as a mailing list. see details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the lower window configuration, you can change event promotions, change or delete these promotions, change or delete. event actions are executed if a previously specific event happens, such as the backers of a file. see for details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, Gaplus opens; the last project that was opened. this behavior can't be influenced by default.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open a different project, Open Project.... from the menu Project or the Symbol project open from toolbar. the dialog box will display and allows selecting a project. projects have .webprj as extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">If & Proaplus; closed, the project file will be saved automatically. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving, if & quantitative; changed files. the same happens if you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project management provides free access to the files in the project. the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders are as well, but missing items open and open with... in the right mouse button-available context menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can select different profiles. the profile contains information on the location of the uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows the removal of the current profile. if only one profile is available, the button will terminate to remove the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will be kept in the kernel-memory and then forget it. this option is useful if common uploading of files is needed and the rather unsafe passable password will be saved in question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog when you change your opinion before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & Proaplus; many high-charging profiles can be created and thus the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to various servers. when editing or creating a profile will appear this dialogue:</seg>
<seg id="2186">That's the name of the server to which the files are to be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed KIO slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (locally) and NFS.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. normally this must not be changed, except the network administrator runs a service on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your anxiety, this is either a time saving function or a danger. use the password stored on the plate, so it is not easy to read, but each with programming knowledge it can easily be seen in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only a set of files and toolbars. it can be displayed in a project many views, i.e. by simply dipping the view, several files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the current files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be opened in the menu project or the project toolbar, accessible via the toolbars project toolbar, open or deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantitative; with which one has to do most. this helps not only increase productivity but also allows the adaptation of & quantitative information; to its own work.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As already mentioned above, tool bars & conaplus; best on the menu toolbars. use and adding, adding tool bars is treated below in the section of adding tool bars.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbars and the symbols are either set to be set either by context menu (right click on the toolbar), in which new action can be created, it can set other actions like toolbar, toolbar or toolbar, which can be specified in the dialog where the actions can be visible on this or other toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to a action (icon) on a toolbar, the entries will be removed and indicated in action that are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbars and the actions on them can set up in the menu with settings of toolbars... and settings the actions.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are in essential documentaries, code cutlets and files to linking. & quantitative information, used as a usual file system with advanced organization and interfaces. one can copy, postpone or any of the system existing directory in the template tree. templates have in & quantitative; in about restrictions you need to be used for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some of them with & quantitative; provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions used at the beginning of each template.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is everything that is not pure text. it can be inserted any file apart from text, so images, & PDF; binocular templates are normally inserted in documents by shortcuts (e.g. images with IMG src = / src / url). some examples are found in the template tree under global templates. further information on templates tree is available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created from any text documentation. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. normally a simple report for the purpose and organises work in the appropriate way to be efficient. some examples may be found in the template tree under global templates. see for more information about templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This type of templates is useful if it is not a new document based on a template, but the same text area is always re-added to documents. you can find everything from a comment about a final note to a complete menu system on JavaScript or Perl basis. some examples are available in the template tree under global templates. see for more information about templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve for whole websites as templates. you are organized a collection of various documents that can be organized in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantitative information.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure according to exposure (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;) and select file as template as local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">As soon as it is done, note that (even if it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. check in the template tree under project management.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click on file as template-to-use selection as local / project template. alternatively, the selection can easily be drawn with pulling and shutdown onto the build-up template.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file is only enough to copy in a pre-level folder. all file management functions can be used, such as clockwise and shutters or insert about the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can select a folder on the right file or in the project files to create a folder on the right and secure site presentation, but of course it is saved in the project folder, but of course it can be stored as local or global presentation.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates allow a very goal oriented approach. you can add headlines and footlines or dynamically with & PHP; create, add files or linked to them. additionally, some things in use of templates can be kept very profound in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files stored in $KDEDIR / share / apps / quantitative / apps / dice / apps / dice / apps. each of these folders is equivalent to one of four different types of containers, as described above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To set the behavior of a folder you can click on the folder with the right mouse button on the folder and to select in the context menu Properties. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection field with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is blown as soon as the attributes can be inherited.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fit for everything except for the regular folders. if a trunk folder would be set in principle, except it would be explicitly enabled. in case of normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text message. if nothing appears, it is likely to be found in a common folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows for a custom or added text for templates in this folder. this could be general headlines or footlines for any templates for a specific project and allows for copying files in a folder with special headlines / footlines a complete presentation with the matching headlines / footlines.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, we have the context menu (shown on the right mouse button) via a complete set of command to add folders or copy and add templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& Proaplus; offers two modes: VPL; Editor and VPL; & Source Editor, which can be reached via the menu View. the first mode replaces the source editor in two parts: the source editor and VPL; Editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; Editor works as follows: he will load a document such as a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -page and cursor. then you can edit and need to be able to use as required for the source code editor in which the carried out changes in VPL; -editor are visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; Editor on a document that contains & PHP; it is not possible to edit this directly with VPL; Editor. it is not possible to edit this directly with VPL; editing & PHP; it is still necessary to change this code editor. there is no plans to change this behavioural code.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works exactly like the first, except that at the same time the changes in the source editor and in VPL; Editor is activated and the cursor in the source editor and in VPL; this mode has been activated, this mode has already been activated, the key press should keep the active cursor of a window to the others, where the position is maintained in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronisation interval between the VPL; Editor and the source editor can be set adjustable via Settings Quanta.... After choosing VPL; -View may be set automatically between synchronization after one click or automatically. in addition, the recommendation can be set automatically. in addition, the recommendation: a small pot for fast calculator and a large pot for slow computers.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, so it is possible to select the description of the invisible tags when working with VPL; Editor is also called as soon as a new document with the VPL; editor will also be called. this is the following change of calorie code. thus you can change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta-Tags gives the storage of information about the document itself, e.g. buzzwords for Internet search engines. meta-elements can be added or removed by pressing the two switching surfaces below or removed. a click on the list allows the change of the inhaltes, such as key words in column name and keywords keyword keywords.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way to design the design of pages in the browser. you can add CSS rules to the list or delete. a change on the list is exactly as with the meta-elements. the processing of CSS rules are currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to integrate with an external CSS style system by pressing the button and select the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The cursor is like in a text processing, because of evidence with arrows, possible. under rare circumstances the cursor still behaved as usual. text can be inserted as usual. text can be inserted through intidolls and deleted by check or remover.</seg>
<seg id="2225">The insertion of tags will be done in the same way about toolbars, as in the source editor. it is to be noted that the insertion of tags must not be removed beforehand, e.g. a anchors day, encircled with text, any other surrounding anchors must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbars as the tables-assistant or the lists-assistant are disabled. they will be working later in & VPL; they will be used later in this release the tables or lists of toolbars are used.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; is a tool for the examination of stylisteners. in contrast to other programs for style, the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of stylisteners can be tracked.</seg>
<seg id="2228">To compile & xsldbg; you can compile able to compile save & kde; yet the libraries are libxslt, libexslt and libxml, which are already present in a typical installation of & kde; already available.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphic tools for comparisons. why so & kdiff3;? let me explain why I have written.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merging was very complicated, because one of the contribution had changed many changes and simultaneously changed the inwards. another programmers had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts in the assembly.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me was only the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly was changed within these lines. and there was no references to the places where perhaps only the backfeeding had changed. the merging of these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; showed differences within one line and changes to white characters. later, any amount of more useful features were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">If you want to compare fast text, copy it into the clipboard and add it into one of the comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function made a lot of work was the same and merge of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost in a fully-file-file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way intermittance is fully supported. this is useful if two persons can work independently of one piece code work and changes. the original file (the base) helps secure changes. in this editor, you can even edit the result. in this editor, you can even edit the outcome directly. the screenshot shows three Quell files when working:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& the diff3; helps you to connect to the same and merge tracking. this screen photo shows & kdiff3; at the folder merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& the diff3; shows the exact differences and distracted the possibilities of today's colour monitors. if you have to check Kode often, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabs are visible. if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters, one can see at a glance at the summary in column on the left side. (no trouble more if I change the inwards.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">When a file is equal, and the other distinguishes itself in one line, then shows the colour which is different. red color means that both are different to distinguish them.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files are the same name, but in different folders, you can easily make the typing work by default the file names of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">The diff3 folder, folder, folder, folder, folder, folder, folder, folder, folder, folder, folder, folder, 2 folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">Opening dialog enables manual dendolls of filename files that can choose from the file browser (file...) or select a last modified file from the recording list. you will need to specify a third file, if you have to leave the entry for C, the analysis of the differences are done with two files.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Via the button folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, select the same or merge of folders. if for A one file is selected, for B and C, however, select a folder, then use & kdiff3; the filename from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">When communicating is crossed, the input field is active and can be processed. however, it is not necessarily necessary to establish a output file immediately after saving it.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setup button opens a dialog with Settings. here you can set options before you start with the same / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you would not like to compare all the file, but only parts of a text compare. & kdiff3; enables you to select text parts from the clipboard in the active comparison window. the comparison starts immediately. in opening dialog you will need to select files, you can simply connect the dialog with the button button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use pulling and shutters: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from a editor and let it fall on a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What thought is behind it? sometimes, a file example contains several similar functions. if you want to figure out how these functions are, it would only need to create two appropriate files, download them in & kdiff3; download and compare these relevant sections just to copy, insert and then compare it.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently, you can extract anything from & to diff3; only the flawning of text in a comparative window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the pulling and copy of text to another program as cutting and insert (instead of copying and insert). in such case, your original data might be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each text window, the info line contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional), let the mouse rest a while on the line. then a small relief window will show the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source star are the letters A, B and C. A has the color blue, B colour green and C is magenta. (this default settings can be changed over the settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is recognized, one sees the color that is different. if both files are different, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is especially useful if you compare three files. that is in the next Section (merge).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In addition to the text is the summaries column. when differences were found, the column displays the corresponding color. in some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only relevant changes. (at C / C + + e.g., white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in few, rare individual cases relevant.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line that separates the combined column of the text is interrupted by the digits where the respective source file has no lines. if the line is activated, the line will be displayed on broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The results window (below the comparison star) also has an info line with the inscription output: the filename and [hchanges] if you already have the result. usually it contains by the automatic mering text, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts have been dissolved, the store is deactivated!!! (do not use buttons to next one of the remaining conflicts to find out the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">When only two comparative windows are used, every difference is also a conflict which has to be solved.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows, the group is indicated in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed in the windows, where the group is then not visible.) This group is then highlighted the current group. it is highlighted in the color background colour for current section and on the left is a black beam.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes the automatic merge or by manual processing is no further line more in the group; then it is indicated in these lines of text & lt; no line in the Quelputs; this text appears to change and perhaps again another source. this text appears not in the final file, yet in a marking which you might need to copy and anywhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge operation, but appears in the clipboard, when you copy such text from the results window. go carefully with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: when selecting the sources you ignore or ignored C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are treated as white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigates will always be used to use the keyboard and mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you are in one of the window, you can use the arrow keys to the left, beginning, end, Ctrl-beginning and Strg end, Siw can also be used by other programs. the overlcts column may also be used beside the vertical screen bar by clicking on the navigation.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the eye window, you can also use the other keys to edit. using the insert button, you can switch between insert and outdoor mode. (default is the plug-in mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">One click with the left mouse button in one of the summarised columns is synchronized the view of all windows at the beginning of the respective group (as already in the section Merging and the output window was declared).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump into the current / first / last difference (Ctrl-picture upward) or to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-picture inward) or to the next / previously unsolved conflict. therefore, it must be regarded as conflict between soluble and unsolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the marking to the clipboard, you need to copy the copying button (Ctrl-C or Strg-insert). if this activates, you need to select automatically into the clipboard and copy the manual copying automatically. be careful with this option, because you might overwrite the content of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line-up are stored according to the operating system operating system. UNIX variants use a line-up character\, and Win32-based systems use car folder + line-feed-feed\\ r\. KDiff3 retains the line files of the source files, therefore you should use & kdiff3; also not using binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and list of the most recently used files are automatically stored and re-produced during the next start. (menu Settings &gt; KDiff3 Read...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Choose a font with fixed width. (on some systems the dialog appears with variable width to choose from, you should not use it.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">When you activate this option, differences are shown in short text, if the selected font does not support this representation, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in its pure form, but would be routed. on these systems the button settings will automatically be an odlit color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">When this option is enabled, the desired number of space is inserted when pressing the Tabulator button. otherwise, a tab character will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press the input or return, the reverse line will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">If this option is enabled, each selection will be copied automatically into the clipboard. manual copy in the clipboard then falls.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can choose which type of line type you prefer to save. the default value is the commonly used range on the used operating system.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In the same step you tries to find all completely identical lines in the source files. only during this first step, white signs can be ignored. in this step, white characters will not be ignored. also, white characters will not be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a car back sign '\' at the end of a line, others want to save a line-up '\'. if this option is activated, car resign are visible, however, such as a white sign is treated, however, this option has to be disabled. however, this option is deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="2331">This option is disabled in the first part of the analysis and associated characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') ignored. in the result the differences are displayed, but they are treated like white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2332">This option is disabled to be disabled. changes in comments are treated like changes in white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensely look for smaller differences. the option is enabled in the default setting. it's effective for complicated and large files, but slowly with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In the automatic jump mode, this setting how long the result of the selection is displayed, before the next pending conflict is passed.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Dissolves automatically all conflicts in white signs by choosing the chosen file as source. (default is manual selection.) This is useful if you need to ignored the functions of voters A / B / C for all undemanding white conflicts from the merge menu. note that the automatic selection also concerns conflicts in numbers or comments if the options are ignored or ignored C / C + + comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are treated in the chapter to scanning the folders and merge tracking. look for details under documentation on the directory comparison and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and already an older version exists, then the original version is the suffix .original attached. if already one such backup file with the suffix .original, it will be deleted without any further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Fit the language of user interface. changing this option is not the current running program. you need to finish and restart, so that the change is active. (this option is not available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set globally over the control centre.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following coding settings can be set separately for each entry. if you activate this option, it is used for all entries the upper setting.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Above the selection fields for encoding appears a short notice that is the local coding. (this may not be changed here and has a purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Customize the file coding for source files. these influences such as special characters is treated and interpreted as the coding for each file can be adjusted individually, even files can be compared and merged with different coding.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have changed a file, you can define which coding is to be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define procedure commands, they might not work with your codec. (for example, your files could not work 16-bit Unicode, but the default command can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can define the coding of output commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn this off to suppress highlighting in white characters in text or oversight. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignored or ignored C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available when you compare three files. in normal mode all differences between two of three files are visible. after selection of A & lt; -gt; B, A & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; C will be displayed next to the normal still a second overload column with the necessary information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you would like to use the available space on the screen rather for long lines. simply select the less important window. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Submit the comparison window to each other or to each other. this can also be useful to ads of long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you consider the differences and then decide to merge the files. a simple click will then compare the merge and use the file names of the last source file as a preset name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge, then the name of the last used replacement file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file it will be handed down to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can use your own preprocessing, which corresponds to your requirements. you can use this function e.g. to cut interfere parts or to correct the inwards.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file it was given first to this external command. if a default output command has been given (see above), then the output of the command is used only when using this command line. you can write your own preprocessing, which corresponds to your requirements. each input line has to have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind that user is more flexibility when setting up the deff results. however, an external program is needed, and most users don't want to program this. good news is, however, in most cases SED or perl is completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this tutorial command for line-off order to convert the input in uppercase letters: SED's /\\ '\\ 1 /' This. * is an ergoidal expression of any character string. the\\ 1 in the replacement string refers to the found text in the first clammernfew. the\\ U converts the found text in uppercase.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS\ $\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\ $\\\\\\ $\\\\\\ $\\\\\\ $\\\\\\ $\\\\\\ $\\\\\ $\\\\\\ $\\\\\ $\\\\\ $\\\\\ $\\\\\ $\\\\\ $\\\\\ $\\\\\ $\\\\\ $\\\\\ $\\\\\ $\\\\\ $\\\\\ $\\\\\ $\\\\\ $\\\\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you can experiment with SED, you may get to understand it and perhaps you may see this regular expressions even. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The ignored of numbers is actually a built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example for a further pre-processing sequence for line-off right. SED's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Each character is replaced by nothing but virtually deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several problems at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' use the creation of each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead SED instead of SED you can also use something different such as perl -p -e's / REGEXP / replacement / switch 'allergies are perl some details differently. where SED\\\ (and\\) needs perl only needed (and) without the precursing'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">Data according to normal pre-processor are maintained for viewing and bring together. the other surgeries only change the data which the line-off-off-algorythmus can change.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases when you use a normal processor, the line-up processor provides the output of the normal pre-processor as an input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful but, as with any function which changes the text changes or differences, you can not notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often you have to edit the programmers in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge all the folder recursive and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a proposal for bringing a proposal to merge; you can customize the proposal before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merge and simulate the simulated changes without them.</seg>
<seg id="2364">... performs selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with the selected objects (F6-key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to the same and merge of individual files. you only need to open files on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders are merged, folder 1 is used as basis. if no target folder is specified, & kdiff3; folder 3 as target folders.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders will automatically start to run the merge, you must select the appropriate menu entry or press the F7 key. (further details will follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder you will be informed about the current progress. when scanning the folders, only the files are listed, which were compared until then.</seg>
<seg id="2369">If scanning of the folder is completed, shows & diff3; a list window with the results on the left,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and each folder which was found during the scan, will be displayed here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click here.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder is usually folded down. you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - click, or on the object double or by clicking the arrow keys on the left / right. the directory menu contains two functions All subdirectories and all subdirectories up with which you can open all the folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">When you double click on a file, the file format is started and it appears a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in different folders, then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details window to the selected object. in such case the combined cycle promotion can not be selected automatically. if the merging is started, you will be informed about problems of this type.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the above picture, in the columns A / B / C, the colours red, green, yellow and black are used.</seg>
<seg id="2376">When identical entries, the color is identical, even if the age of entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered as identical when your entire content is identical. then folders the same color. at folders is the age unconsiderably for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea of this color scheme is based on the diff. the colours reflect the colors of a leaf again, which is only green, then yellow becomes and later when it is old, red will be red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C identical but not B: copy B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>

<seg id="2387">During working, a file after the other is working. you status column shows pigtig, when the merging was successful, and according to other reports, if a result was completed, you should make a final review and see if the status is OK.</seg>
<seg id="2388">When setting up the file similar method is selected, KDiff3 further columns is selected, this contains the number of convents, dissolved, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for soluble conflicts will be displayed only if three folders are compared or linked.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either perform the just selected entry (file or Odner), or all entries at one time. if you have selected all interfables-actions (even in all subdivisions) you can run the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you have no target folder, then in the three-folder merge mode C is used as the target, in the two-folder merging, B and / or B is used as the target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a target folder, please check if all entries should be displayed in the target folder, too. there are some options that could be skipped by certain entries. verify these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries, select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the key root). to move only the current entry: select the action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If by contradictory data types, there are still invalid interactions exist, a message appears on the incorrect elements. they can then select a valid action.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialog window appears with the options to withdraw and breaking them.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulate if you would like to see what would happen without the really changes. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then execute certain actions with all entries. if a manual procedure is needed (merge a single file), then a merge window will open (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you are ready for a file, select the directory merge / continue or press F7. if you are not yet saved, a corresponding dialog appears. then leads & kdiff3; his work will continue with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3; on an error, a message appears and detailed status information. at the end of the list you will help you to try out the cause of the problem. if you want to try the problem to select or the problem entry. so, you have the opportunity to solve a different action for the entry or to solve the problem in another way before you continue with the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some records were individually assembled, noted & kdiff3; these entries (in the current session) and leads them not again in later. even if this would result in merging, these entries are considered as done. only if you change the merging action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (menu settings - &gt; Kdiff3) has now a section called directory merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that are displayed on the specified pattern will be displayed in the element tree. multiple patterns can be entered. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. (eg. * .cpp; * .h). the default file is not equal to this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that correspond to this pattern will not be displayed in the element tree. it can be entered in the element tree, use the semicolon; as a separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .original * .O.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that correspond to this pattern will not be displayed in the element tree. it can be entered in the element tree, use the semicolon; as a separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .original * .O.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS. the great advantage is that this folder can be adjusted with .cvsignore file. (look at info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a Verstappen -attribute. in other file systems marks a leading point. this option lets you decide whether these files are displayed in the element tree or not. this option is enabled in the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="2406">For links to files: if the option is switched off, the symbolic link should be compared if the option is switched on, the files are compared to which the links are disabled. this is deactivated in the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="2407">For links based on folders: if the option is switched off, the links are treated like normal folders and recursively. (note that & kdiff3; not on possible recasts. a link to a folder which lead to itself would lead to a final loop and slipple 3; crashes off.) This option is shut down in the presetting.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Performs a complete analysis of each file by and shows the statistics columns. (the number of dissolved, non-white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and considerably slower when it is applied to files that contain no text. (enter an appropriate anti-pattern).</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large file via a slow network, it is maybe faster to compare the change date and the file size. please note that this option is to be careful of security. please check this option in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similarly to the change date. there is no real comparison instead. the files are considered as identical if it is equal to change the change date lost. please be used with caution. this option is shut down in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activating the synchronizing mode if two folders are compared and no target folders. in this mode, the proposals are identical to that both folders are identical. also the results of merge files are stored in both folders. this option is shut down in the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, the copying of the newer file is suggested as action. (this is thought that the other file does not have changed.) This option is shut down in any case.) This option is shut down in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or a folder will be replaced or deleted, then the original version is renamed and gets the extension .original. if an old backup file already exists, it will also be deleted without further backup. this option also concerns the result of individual files, not only the whole folder. this option is enabled in the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the folders merge pane remains visible in the fusion of individual files; you can switch off the window divider with the mouse. if you do not want to switch the window or text window, you can switch the window & text window between the two views between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare a file easily by clicking with double click. however, you can also run a single file using the merge menu. as soon as you save the result, the status will be done and the file will not run once, when you run the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">This status goes however, if you want to read the directory again: directory -menu: read new</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparent with the help of KIO slaves. KDiff3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way you can specify files and folders to open to local or remote computers.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file using a FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has some other syntax as local files and folders. some things you should note:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relatively and.. or.. not included. that's not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be cascaded. (# - &gt;% 23, empty index &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the file system on the server, sometimes by the protocol. it follows a short list of restrictions:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be differentiated if a link is based on a file or folder. then a file will always be accepted as link target. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to process permissions or changeover date. therefore, the permissions or change of change from the original. (note that option is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose of use is currently as differences in KDevelop. KDevelop starts to start the built-in Differences. to start Kdiff3, press the right mouse button on the differences of the viewer and then select in Kdiff3Part from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally you need & kdiff3; two full input files. if it is applied to the format, it takes & kdiff3; the patch file is required from the patch file. at least one of the two files must exist. then starts & kdiff3; the program patch to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the context menu, you can select a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - Kdiff3Part. please note that if not the original files exists, it is unreliable if the original files have changed since generation of the patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiff3; as part is executed, it only supports the same of two files, a very small tool bar and menu. the merge or the same of folders is not supported in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and Kdiff2 (now it is comest) there is already. in addition, the name Kdiff3 indicates that it can merge together like the program diff3 from the Diff Tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I use the GPL programs already very long and have learned a lot by searching in the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers that have gone this way or to go so.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You have probably compiled the program from the sources and configure the right prefix to KDE. in default, in / usr / local, KDE will not find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information about this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines will be first identical as identical; however, if only a non-white character is different, the line is not identical. if it is not identical, if the rate is not identical, this is the Vis-the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor notes for any difference in the files where he starts and where he ends. this important information is lost if the result is just stored as text file and it is too much effort to create extra-own file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort was too large so far. you can always recover certain version by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit larger quantities of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly lt; no src lins; released and the text can't delete. what does this mean and how can this be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; already used many colors for lifting differences. even more highlighting would be confusing and missing the purpose. use another editor to do it.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and troubleshooting came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kdiff3; you will need & kde; 3.1 or later.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information about how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE you can find on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of recent changes can be found under http: / / / diff3.sourceforge.net / Changelog or in the file changelog in the Quell package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install & kdiff3; compile and install on a system with & kde; use the following command in the base folder of the & diff3; -Distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir gives you the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsafe, you will find further details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Da & kdiff3; autoconf and automake uses, you should not have problems with compile. should not difficulty occur, please report on the & kde; -mailinglists of it.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Remove (Ctrl-X or Umschalt-Remove) copied to the clipboard and remove the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Umschalt-insert) add the text from the clipboard to the current cursor position or replaces the current marking.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only differences are shown: files that are identical in all folders are not appear in the folder, and therefore not in target folders.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version you need to read on these options the folder with the function Update.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">Only entries are displayed, the differences may have to be copied to the target folder. if the target file does not already contain these files, they are missing according to the target. (the behavior is likely to be switched on in a later program version.) This option is shut down in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to choose from the source with the label A, B and C below the menu bar. if you are attached to one of the buttons, the lines are attached to the end of the selected group at the end of the selected group (if they are not already available), if the lines are already available, then click on the button again.</seg>
<seg id="2449">This option is disabled this option. differences in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated like differences in white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & kpager; shows a miniature preview of all virtual spaces. it is quite convenient to change their size programs on the work surfaces, to finish her size or postpone. this works in both desktop and several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & kpager; can display all virtual work areas as well as those in the current applications. applications can be selected and even on the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button windows can be moved within & kpager; motion is possible both within a desktop and other workspace.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on how the right mouse button is clicked: if on the empty background of & kpager; click here, the context menu will appear only the two entries Pager; however, there are also the symbol and the name of the application as well as the entries Minimize, maximize, on top and sending. the commands do the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window on the full size of the desktop. appears only if it was clicked on a application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. appears only if it was clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is marked, windows can be moved within the & kpager; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other work surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="2457">If this field is crossed, in & kpager; the names of virtual work areas are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Cross the field leaves the & kpager; view the numbers of virtual work areas. it is linked together with names, are provided by the name to be ordained, & eg; 1. desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is crossed, the background of each desktop will also appear as background in the & kpager; shown in the background.</seg>
<seg id="2460">If this field is crossed, the current programs are displayed as small windows in the & kpager; otherwise, only the empty workspace will be displayed to allow their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here is the view of the program window. simply shows simple rectangle with the proportions of program windows. symbol shows the window with its standard symbol and Pixmap shows a small view of the real program window. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very quick systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">The arrangement of the & kpager; -main window will be determined: classic provides & kpager; in a 2-n grid, like from Pager applications in some other window managers, horizontally shows all virtual spaces in a horizontal line, which is very good for the presentation side on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager Miniprogram in the Control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, view windows as symbols or with their content and move it outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Click the right mouse button within & kpager; and subsequent triggering of switching switches... can appear the dialog for Settings.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently this is not changed in the dialog for Settings. but you can do it manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc using any text editor such as & kedit; or vi. if you have no write permission for the file, you must use the key windowtransparent mode and assign it to this file. possible values are:</seg>
<seg id="2467">Da & kpager; part of the package base is needed, you will need a working installation of the KDE basic packages.</seg>

<seg id="2481">& kmag; is a very powerful application that is constantly expanding for new functions. it is optimised for use on high-performance computers.</seg>
<seg id="2482">When you get & kable, a window appears as above. the main window of & kmag; shows the enlarged range of screen. in the following, this window will be displayed as a magnification window. the image that is displayed in the magnification window is an enlarged area of the screen and is described in the following as a selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2483">In the default setting it increases & kmag; the area around the mouse pointer like a mobile horn. alternatively, you can arrange a selected screen area in the magnification window (selection dialog) or the surroundings of the mouse pointer (eg; on the left screen).</seg>
<seg id="2484">If you want to avoid the mouse indicator in the enlarged window, select the mouse pointer. please note that it is not able to detect the shape of the mouse pointer. this is always the standard kde; / Qt; -mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2485">In the selection window mode, you can customize the select window to your own needs. you can shift it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size. this can be done in the following way:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the mouse pointer in the magnification window and hold down the left mouse button, so you can catch the contents of the magnifying button and postpone. this also goes with the arrow keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If you want to press & Shift; press & MMB; in addition, you can move the select window.</seg>
<seg id="2488">With this combination, you can change the size of the selection dialog. note that the upper left corner of the selection dialog will remain and only move the lower right corner.</seg>
<seg id="2489">& kmag; has a lot of functions. you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer, copy to a file to insert it into the clipboard (to insert it later into other applications), turn the image and much more.</seg>
<seg id="2490">Running or stops the update of the update. the stops of updating causes that the required CPU time is set to 0.</seg>
<seg id="2491">Select the refresh rate (Very low, low, medium, high, Very high). the higher the refresh rate, the more CPU time is needed.</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click as soon as the mouse pointer for a while on the same spot. it is thought to help people suffer from the repetitive strain relief (RSI) syndrome, and to which each mouse click pain. furthermore, it also requires a little exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can remove the pain when using the mouse, and helps to use the mouse to use the mouse without pain. unfortunately, you may receive pains due to the use of your computer. unfortunately, you should receive a doctor if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="2500">In order to clear it even more clear: even if & kmousetool should avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse, it is against pain, which can be caused by the mouse, effective. and as with all ergonomic aid agencies: the result can vary per differently.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and leads a mouse click as soon as you break the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the smart move is activated, makes & kmousetool; a break after it expires the mouse button. in this way, you can run the mouse when pressing the mouse button. the intelligent move requires a little exercise, but you can get used quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This life time must be stopped after the end of the mouse movement before and kmousetool; a mouse click away.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If Intelligenes is switched on, the shooting time is set (1 / 10 s). here the time is set, the & kmousetool; after shutdown the mouse button is waiting before it leaves the mouse button again, if there is no evidence of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; supports this function enabled, creates a slow move by right and back, followed by a break, one click with the right mouse button. a slow motion is stored in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt for the first time, but they can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">If the sound is delayed, you can move & kde; to prevent the reaction time. open the & kcontrolcenter;, go on Sound & Multimedia, choose the sound system and here the rider of General. there is a slider sound buffer that you can adjust to a lower value to reduce the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is marked, this setting is started & kmousetool; at any start of & kde; this function is currently under & kde; available. at GNOME or other window environments please select the relevant documentation to figure out how to start a program automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Set all settings on the values that were set when opening the dialog. have already pushed the button in the button, the settings are reset to the last pressures of users.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; initially with the default settings. in particular, smart move should first be switched off. if you want to get used to the automatic mouse, you can later make the smart move.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it is necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; with sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First you should be aware of what places remains a mouse click without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or on places in the browser window, which does not show a link, does not lead to park unintentional reactions. you can use the mouse to park such places until you want to use it again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">If your mouse is jerky, you should clean your mouse. that's normally pretty easy. the trick is that you can not only cleanse the mouse, but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you need to remove the mouse ball. as it happens, from mouse to mouse, it should be clear when you watch the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you have to see the rolls. these are located on the sides of the hole in which the sphere was used. the trick and pollution can easily scrapped easily with a flat blade or the fingernagel.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system breaks the execution of & kmousetool; if in this case, in this case, the smart move has been started, means that & kmousetool; the operation does not end any more by the right mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens if you use & kmousetool; use a window manager and move one window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem exists, that you even run a mouse click here. this is the status of & kmousetool; reset and you can work as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter the text, tries & kmousetool; continue to carry mouse clicks and continue the cursor to another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor there. however, you can use the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop, if you don't want to make sure that the mouse clicks are unintentional reactions. secure zones for the mouse pointer, & eg; the gray surfaces around the toolbars and menus and the frontlines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I'm trying to work with the smart move, but I do not create it to edit the text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The smart move is a advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you can handle it. it's very probably possible to move it into the clipboard or to move any other action when you want to move your mouse over the pressing mouse button. however, there will probably be some problems here. here are some advice about it:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Use the smart move not only if you're just getting started & kmousetool; to use. select text instead as follows: perform a mouse button on the end of the text area, while keeping the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and use the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. as a mouse click here, when & kmousetool; the mouse button expresses the sound as a mouse click. later you can use the smart move also without the audible mouse click here. however, it needs some exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To be able to use & kmousetool; you have to install the Xtest extension for & X Window, which should already be the case on most system.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and speakers and are set correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; betting the mouse button as soon as the mouse pointer. this program was developed for people who suffer from the RSI syndrome and has prepared the firm of the masts pain.</seg>

<seg id="2622">To understand the tasks of filtering, it is important to know how the program ""-dispatcher" works with a text. & ktts; distinguishes four kinds of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The edition of Screen Readers has the highest priority. it will continue to all the orders and will keep these orders. if the edition of the Screen reader is presented, the orders will be resumed again.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news such as & eg; processor is reserved to hot. a warning has priority and keeps the edition of messages and normal text. these orders will be resumed after the edition of the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News have the next priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that can read messages. while you & eg; one long text on a web site can welcome you with & kmouth; someone welcome to enter the room. & kde; alerts are also news. read this.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text applications. any order you use from cardboard card orders is a textbook. KSayit is an example of applications that use text applications. KSayit is intended for the output longer texts that possess any special pressure.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four orders are handled in queue, with the exception of the edition of Screen readers. if an application sends the output of a screen-reader, during & ktts, this issue will keep and finished.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you have to know that filters will never be applied to the output of Screen readern. you will be applied to normal warnings, messages and text agreements as well as on & kde; -News.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filters edit the text and pass it to the next filter. at present there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are executed as modules. in the future there can be even further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Replacement strings replace parts of a text through other text. specify the replacement parts can be delivered either as words or regular expressions, which enable the replacement of chat-cheek such as: -) by text or for the conversion of messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a better understanding form.</seg>

<seg id="2634">Each of these different filters has set adjustable rules after which it is applied for a language output. if the filter is determined that its rules will not be applied, he gives the text unchanged at the next filter.</seg>

<seg id="2672">If you have access to the KDE source code, you can download the package with & ktts; you can find it in the folder. furthermore, you will find the source code of kdefile under ftp: / / ftp.kde.org / pub / kde /.</seg>
<seg id="2673">Contains many languages, a list of all supported languages you can find http: / / Spak.sourceforge.net / Force.html.</seg>
<seg id="2674">American English, British, Spanish, German, Finnish, Czech, Polish, Russian, Italian, French, Canadian French, Kiswahili, Zulu and Ibio.</seg>
<seg id="2675">KTTS works with any voice synthesizer that can be launched at the command line in one & console.</seg>
<seg id="2676">The list of the above languages can be uncomplete or obsolete. therefore, select the description of synthesizer to the supported languages. check also on the website of ktts;, according to information that are not included in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2677">The program ""-dispatcher" uses a adaptive module architecture for voice synthesizer. if you want & ktts; to use other synthesizers, use the developer team in conjunction with the development team.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The program xsltproc is used for the support of SSML and for the & XML; conversion filter is, but is not necessarily necessary. Debian users can install xsltproc using the command apt-get install xsltproc.</seg>
<seg id="2679">To compile & ktops, you need a current development environment of KDE (Version 3.4 or later) including the cdelibs and the program files for the program ""-dispatcher."</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you have purchased the source text from & ktts; you have downloaded and install the tarball of the source code created every night or reinstall the program with the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before you can use & ktops, check first if the-dispatcher works correctly with your voice synthesizer. you can use the Shellsign SPD-conf.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktops; in & kde; 4.4 is the first version of & ktops used; the program dicttmsgr is to be further developed so that the device of the dispatcher is not possible and the script SPD-conf is no longer required.</seg>
<seg id="2683">A long text is distorted in individual movements. the user can go back or retrieve it or cancel the output.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If an application text on & ktts, you can specify a female speaker for the output. for example, if you have a speaker up, whose language is English and its gender, this is used, otherwise the best matching speaker is chosen. if you want more about it, like & ktts, you can see a speaker.</seg>
<seg id="2685">If you click on the card's speaker to add or click on the map, click on the list and click on Edit menu, for example, the boxes of the module for Festival Interactive is shown below. for details on the modules you will find under.</seg>
<seg id="2686">Enter the path to the detailed festival program. if the path to festival included in PATH, you must only enter the festival.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Select the editor for Text that will be handed over to the Festival. for voices, the & ktops, this setting will be made automatically. generally, Western languages are ISO 8859-1, Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak. ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2688">With these sliders, make volume, microphone speed and pitch of the synthetic language. if you cannot select a few controller and display this gray, the voice can not be selected by you.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Some voices such as MultiSyn voices will need to be loaded several seconds due to their size. if you mark this check box, these voices will already be loaded with the start of KTTSD, so that (at greater memory consumption) the first set will be synthesized.</seg>
<seg id="2690">If this check box cannot be selected, you have not set up one speaker (or forgot to click on any user).</seg>
<seg id="2691">If this check box is marked when starting from kttsmgr the program window is visible, but not the program window is visible, but not the program window. click the icon in the system section to display the program window.</seg>
<seg id="2692">If this check box is marked and ktmgr does not run, it appears in the system area, as soon as KTTSD reads a text. as a result, you have the opportunity to read or stealing it otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Here are all the orders listed in the waiting long, along with the application that has set the order, the current status of the order, the number of propositions and the just worked set. the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the card card speaker.</seg>
<seg id="2694">With buttons in this series you can select satin in the order that is selected or returned in the list below. (but not each order is composed of several sets).</seg>
<seg id="2695">With one click on OK all changes from the settings (also on the other card cards) and kttsmgr will be scaled down to the icon in the system section. click the icon to display the program window.</seg>
<seg id="2696">If the sound system & art is not installed, but instead ALSA, GStreamer or aKode, click on the Map card audio. see also.</seg>
<seg id="2697">Here only text applications are listed and administered. editions of Screen refuses, warnings and messages are not displayed. further information on the news types of & ktts; find in.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Select the kind of audio output. if one component can not be selected, was compiled & read; either without support for the corresponding audio module, or & ktts; can't load the necessary libraries.</seg>
<seg id="2699">If Gstreamer or aKode for the audio output is to be used, select the audio output. if no output modules are displayed in the list, you need to install at least one module. have ALSA selected, select the PCM device. see also</seg>
<seg id="2700">Make the microphone speed here. 50nbsp;% corresponds to approximately half and 200nbsp;% about the double normal speaking speed. so these settings can be converted, the program SOX will be installed.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Click on applicator to take the new settings for the current & ktts; -system.</seg>
<seg id="2702">The list of ALSA tools includes all PCM devices and modules that are set up in your system. most of them will not work. you'll need to figure out which device works with you. in doubt, choose Standard.</seg>
<seg id="2703">On this card map, you can always configure particular actions which will always be executed if the text contract is interrupted by a message with higher priority. & ktts; processes four types of voice contracts:</seg>
<seg id="2704">The edition of Screen Readers has the highest priority. it will be submitted to all other orders and will keep these orders. once the edition of the Screen reader has been read, the orders received will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Warnings have priority priority. this level is important news such as & eg; processor is reserved to hot. a warning keeps the edition of messages and normal text. these orders will be resumed after reading the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2706">News have the next priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that can read messages. if you read & eg; just a long text on a website, you can welcome you with & kmouth; nevertheless someone welcome you to enter the room.</seg>
<seg id="2707">If a text contract is interrupted by a message, warning or the output of a screen-reader, adds & ktts; the audio output into the queue one.</seg>
<seg id="2708">This audio file will always be played when a normal text is interrupted. if both the introductory sound is active as well as introductory message, the introductory sound will be played before the introductory message.</seg>
<seg id="2709">The settings on this card chart is valid only for normal text applications. for news, warnings and the issues of Screen reforms, there are no particular actions when these are interrupted by a message with higher priority.</seg>
<seg id="2710">To start with & ktts; Knotation messages can be found, launch ktmgr and click on alerts. the alCard is alerts.</seg>
<seg id="2711">Mark this check box to switch to read & read; dissimulation devices. if this setting is not selected, the other settings are disabled and / ktts; reads no alerts.</seg>
<seg id="2712">If this setting is marked, alerts, where a sound is played, of & ktts; not specified.</seg>
<seg id="2713">Use these buttons to add events or delete events. if you click on the button, a dialog appears to you to select the application and the event you want to add to list.</seg>
<seg id="2714">This event reads the message before, the & conversation; sent when someone mentions your nickname in an IRC message.</seg>
<seg id="2715">All events, which is not stated in the list, will be ignored by & ktts; ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2716">Use this selection field to define what & ktts; do if an event hits. you have the following selection options:</seg>
<seg id="2717">If you selected custom text, enter the desired text. you can use the following placeholder:</seg>
<seg id="2718">You can enter here the characteristics of the desired microphone station. default select the speaker that is displayed on the box card speaker as the lower entry. see also.</seg>
<seg id="2719">Note that there are three levels of events. if a specific event is specified in a specific application, this promotion will run out. otherwise the action is defined for all other events of specific application. as the last option the action is to carry out under standard (all other events).</seg>
<seg id="2720">The event All notifications for the Application Standard (all other events can not be deleted from the list. for this, you can define the alert notifications as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2721">Use the button Save to save the settings for the alerts in a file. the invited events will start with the events in the list. if you want to start with an empty list, click on delete. all entries except all unauthorized devices will be deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard to select text for the control of voices, the speaking speed, the volume, the sex of voice and pitch. in addition, marks for the control of disappointments. SSML is a part of the VoiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently, & ktts are currently supported; SSML only partly and only in the basic functions. the following restrictions are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You need to install the Rab _ diphone voice (British male) since that is the standard voice, the festival is used in the issue of SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or audio system in the festival configuration dialog is not set to 100nbsp;% is usually spoken very monoton.</seg>
<seg id="2726">&lt;! [CDATA [&lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? / / W3C / / DTD Synthesis 1.0 / / EN / W3C / / DTD Synthesis / synthesis.dtd "&gt; Who has slept in my bed? asked Mama Bear. who has slept in my bed? asked the bear...]] &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and set limit filters (SDB filters). therefore, the first proposition must start automatically, as only the first movement must be synthesized, not the whole text order. so you can also stop or scoop out or break even if the voice synthesizer is not directly supported.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you see the set-limit filters. during the first start of & ktts; it is automatically set up as a pre-limit filter filter. you can change its settings or add other proponent filters, but they will not use it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">On the easiest way you can select the device selection by selecting the speaker selection. if you select the microphone selection again, change some features and check out how the selection of the microphone has changed. for this purpose you have to set up more than a speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktts; then quicker with the preview can start, since only the first proposition must be processed and not the whole text block which can last very long.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Select text orders then on board ticket orders or break it, even if the voice synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal setting limit filters will be set automatically when you start the ktmgr for the first time. it cannot be removed only. do not change anything about this filter unless you know what you do.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Compare text with a regular expression of propositional and add a tabulated sign (Decimal code 8) to the set limits (tabimals are removed from the text). note that the default movement filter filter has the character set.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters will never be applied to & kde; -News (coding), warnings, messages or the output of Screen Readers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">Once you have removed the normal setting limit filter, you can once again insert it by clicking it in & ktts; it contained _ sbdrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The card interface selection allows you to overwrite the microphone settings for application. the card card will be displayed if</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the standard speakers (the top on the card speaker). with other words: no speaking properties are defined.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the most suitable speaker that shows all features of a set-up microphone. if you select the settings of the speaker or edit it, elects & ktts; the speaker that is originally set to originally set the original properties.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to input the desired intercom properties by clicking on one of the select button.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the features of the desired microphone station. if this feature does not play any matter, you don't enter any.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Mark this check box, if the property must have priority before other features. you can also set several markings here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in the release of this issue, it is always necessary to specify this property. if you want to specify the attribute language, if you might know that a specific application text is sent in another language than that of the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all features in the field of narrator, which is the most relevant to the below, click on the select button-up, and then apply to the narrator which corresponds to the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case, 0 stands for the last text reservation in the queue. you can also specify a order number. (without a order number the input is 0 is necessary).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr crashes immediately, when it is started. I compiled my Debug support, but I don't get traceability.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer is crashed and has been finished. probably you need to register GStreamer 0.8.x. if the problem is not solved, possibly a non-compatible version of GStreamer is installed. you can try to update GStreamer or uninstall.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output via ALSA does not work when I play with another application music. if I hold a text message, friert & ktts; a message appears, which says: Vto open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">On your system, the problem exists that conflicts may occur at ALSA using multiple PCM devices. information for possible solutions can be found on the ALSA project (dmix) at www.alsa-projected .org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I have installed an additional voice for the Festival from the internet. I installed it and can use it in the festival, but ktmgr shows this voice not.</seg>
<seg id="2750">Add the new voice in the file $KDEHOME / share / apps / kttsd / Voices. if this is successful, please send me the other entries. if this is successful, please send a patch along with the & URL; if you have found the voice, to the developers.</seg>
<seg id="2751">On the card interface, there is a setting speed. so it works, the program SOX will be installed and via the ambient variable PATH. some Synthesis module such as Festival Interactive offers a setting for speed. depending on the chosen voice, this is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for the microphone speed will be ignored, if & ktts; & HTML; this is clear that the HTML is converted to SSML. (see) or if you are completely courageous, change the .xb file of the & HTML; -after-SSML strapping filter, and set up the microphone speed.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I do not create that web pages are set up with a female voice. I have set up a female festival speaker, but & ktts; reads the websites with a male voice.</seg>
<seg id="2754">At Festival 1.95, the day Sable Gender does not seem to work. so the festival does not make mistakes, the XSL file for converting SSML into Saber the gender tags. the same also applies to VOICE tags.</seg>
<seg id="2755">I have added a own character string filter and now I can go back in & ktts; no more full-trip or return. on the cartographer orders, the order of existing orders will be displayed only from one sentence. what am I doing wrong?</seg>
<seg id="2756">Interpoint characters (point, cargo sign, exclamation mark, Comma and Semikolon) may not be filtering. use a filter for set limits for these characters instead.</seg>
<seg id="2757">ALSA (Advanced & Linux; sound Architecture). ALSA is already installed on most systems with & Linux; (www.alsa-projected .org)</seg>
<seg id="2758">GStreamer in version 0.8.7 or later. note: make sure the modules for GStreamer are registered in front of the use of GStreamer in & ktts; call the command GST register (HTTP: / / gstreamer.freedesop.org)</seg>
<seg id="2759">Some users can experience in connection with ALSA conflicts in the audio output. if your system also counts, you can not start playing music and then start a text if you want to start a text contract and then start another. possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of ALSA (dmix).</seg>
<seg id="2760">With state of July 2005, aKode still does not support any real pauses. if you hold a text message in & ktts, the current proposition is still present.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The SOX audio program is used for general attitude of speaking speed, but is otherwise unforced. Debian users can install SOX with the command apt-get install SOX. the program is already included on most & Linux; CDs already included.</seg>
<seg id="2762">Have you downloaded & ktts; when camball (with tar packed archive), register as usual users and unzip the tarball in a matching folder. change to this folder and enter the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2763">In & kde; 4 is the module's module; probably removed or at least only on request.</seg>
<seg id="2764">The following modules for language synthesizer is created by default. some of them have a running timacy of non-free software. (non-free according to the guidelines of Debian Distribution). the column configure the setting of the setting shows the configure of setting up the setting.</seg>
<seg id="2765">In / opt / kde3 installed, this folder is not listed in / opt / kde3. if this folder is not listed in the ambient variable $KDEDIRS, you need to specify as option --prefix = target.</seg>
<seg id="2766">On Debian-Systems / usr / local is the correct folder for programs that will be translated from sources.</seg>
<seg id="2767">CD kdeco echo t &gt; INST-apps make -f Makefile.cvs. / configure cd-d make su make install</seg>
<seg id="2768">Before you can use & ktops, check first if your language synthesizer works correctly. follow the instructions that you received with the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="2769">The festival is one of the best free TTS synthesizer whose source code is open. the quality of the voices is generally good, and there are several voices and languages supported. by many voices, you can adjust volume, microphone speed and pitch with & ktts;</seg>
<seg id="2770">You need to install at least one language. help you find in the manuals which are supplied with festival. would you like to present your web pages, you need to install the (male British) Voice Rab _ diphone.</seg>
<seg id="2771">For these voices you need to compile an additional module, therefore you need the source code of Festival. the German votes are subject to restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This voice requires the festival 1.95 beta or later. the voice is still in one early development stage. unpack the software in Festival / lib / Voices / Russian /. if you enter the Russian voices, you need to enter the vote for the voices of msu _ ru _ nsh _ diphone. choose a cyrillic (8-bit-) coding such as KOI8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2773">The festival is normally included in the & Linux; distributions. therefore, you are looking for the first to use the CDs of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2774">If you want to use the Polish, Hungarian or Czech languages, the coding must be set to ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2775">If you want to use the Russian voice, the encoding must be set to a 8 bit Cyrus as an example of KOI8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2776">The festival can be used together with the & mbrola; -synthesizer will then take the lexikal analysis and & mbrola; this is generated by the audio output. the & mbrola; program and the & mbrola; -Votes can be downloaded from</seg>
<seg id="2777">Note that & mbrola; generated language from Diphon files. you need additional software to create this diphone. the festival generates these of & mbrola; the necessary diphone. txt2pho can also produce from German texts Diphone. further information can be found under.</seg>
<seg id="2778">In this case, additional Wrapper Code is added to the festival to use & mba; -voices to the voice synthesis. note that the & mba; -Stimulus not in & mbrola; file folder will not be installed, but at the Festival / lib /.</seg>
<seg id="2779">IMS German Festival is a modified version of the festival for German & mbrola; votes. necessary to either festival version 1.4.1 or Festival 2.0 (1.95beta). first, install Festival and mbrola; then download MS German Festival from</seg>
<seg id="2780">Instructions will be found in the README file, which you have downloaded. (for use with Festival 2.0, you need to re-reset the error correction). then add the following lines to the file-festival / lib / sitemit.scm.</seg>

<seg id="2787">Festival Lite is a free, quelloff voice synthesizer which currently supports a limited number of voices and languages. it is a simple voice synthesizer with even sufficient abstaining quality. with & ktops, you can adjust the sound height as louder or volume speed by this language synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Normally, flite is normally included in the & Linux; distributions and therefore look for the first to the CDs of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Hadifix is a two-stage synthesizer that works with diphons. the program txt2pho is translated from the sound. language quality is good, but the support is currently limited to few languages. you can vote voice, pitch, microphone speed, and volume via ktops.</seg>
<seg id="2790">You need at least one German language file from the & mbrola; side and unpack them with unzip into the / usr / local / mbrola folder.</seg>

<seg id="2794">Start the map speaker, click on the Map card. if the epic programs are not included in your PATH, enter the path to the programs on the cardboard box. in the input fields, you can enter additional parameters for the programs. enter in a & console; eps -h or say -h to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="2795">FreeTTS is a free, quelloff voice synthesizer, which was written in & Java; i.e., you need to install the & Java; Virtual Machine on your system. with & Java; can't adjust sound height, volume nor speaking speed.</seg>
<seg id="2796">The command module allows you to use & ktts; with any voice synthesizer, which can be controlled in one & console; on the command line.</seg>
<seg id="2797">Best use a command that writes the language output to a temporary audio file (wav) instead of sending the output directly to the audio device</seg>
<seg id="2798">This manual describes the installation and use of & knetworkconf;, a module for the network interfaces, enabling networking and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; enables users to manage a series of system and desktop settings via a single, integrated surface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be called by selecting K Menu kcontrolcenter;</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & networkconf; package was developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings like other settings from the & kcontroller center; to enable the areas of & networkconf; create a simple surface for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings in & kcontroller center; it is possible to run the network settings (networkconf;) module's network settings; Internet & network network settings can be launched in & menu.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & networkconf; network hardware cannot install. physical devices and their drivers have already been working successfully installed and configured, thus & knetworkconf; the device even shows and enables adjustment of network properties.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases drivers for the network hardware and other devices will be installed for the installation hardware and other devices when installing and installed. network appliances added later, the drivers must be uploaded by adjusting the following files, according to the kernel version.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The network settings will be charged if the network settings is selected in the & kcontroller center; -Index. starting with the module's network settings, this is automatically trying to detect the platform on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform can not be recognized, the main selection is offered. it is the platform from the list to choose which the distribution and the release is best. by selecting the setting non-again requests, the definition can be met automatically. during the next start of the network settings this option will automatically set default.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings are possible only in system management mode. before, all options are displayed gray, meaning the settings can be viewed, the change of change is not possible. in the system management mode the lower end of the module. it is necessary to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system management mode, the module's entire functionality is available. it is divided into three riders:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The rider network interfaces serves to manage the network appliances of the system. all available network devices are displayed. from the rider network interfaces, the following tasks can be carried out:</seg>

<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, major information on basic network technology will be discussed in the second, all by & networkconf; changed configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This area can't replace more information on IP networks. in this appendix only basic information on the integration of the PC into a small (home) network is conveyed.</seg>
<seg id="2840">At present IP networks with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4) has never been operated. from IPv6, it is expected to continue in the near future. this description is therefore concentrated on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is the knowledge that IP address is to assign to a network interface. in a strange network, the network administrators is the contact, which can be configured a valid IP address, or if available, DHCP can not be selected in any case!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When selecting a own small (home) network, the IP address is chosen from a specially designed area to avoid IP address billet with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded to the internet, therefore its any use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet for such machines can be made possible by adjusting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses are mostly used in the areas of 192.168.1.1 through 192.168.1.254. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the power mask is set to 255.255.255.0, so that all machines are connected in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special items, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second the loopback address (localhost = the custom computer). the default route is needed for the IP address.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The 127.0.0.1 network address is reserved for the IP traffic in the local machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to its own so-called loopback interface, which works as a closed circle.</seg>

<seg id="2894">Before a band can be used, it must be selected by & kdat; that can be done on three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; trained the band and read the stressing of the tape. recognise & kdat; the preview on the tape you will be asked if the bond is being formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Detects & kdat; the preview, looking for the matching index on your record. can't be found if the tape index is to be created.</seg>
<seg id="2897">Everything goes smooth, changes the icon to the tape drive to indicate that the band has been mounted. in the status bar, a corresponding message appears. the content of the tape can now be searched through the entry into the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before removing the belt, you must first need to be resolved. there are three methods to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; gives a modification of the symbol for the tape that the binding for the tape has been solved and shows a corresponding error in the status bar. the band can now be cast out without any danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a band of & kdat may be used, it must be formatted by & kdat;</seg>
<seg id="2901">A bandage must be formatted before you will need to be used to save data. if your tape drive does not need to be formatted before you need to be formatted before using the band of & kdat; this process can usually be formatted before using the tape drive, DAT drives on the other hand.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and the capacity goes on & kdat; with the formatting of the tape. all data on the tape can be lost automatically! after the formatting process the band is automatically integrated and is ready for use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you encounter the backup process, you need to choose to make sure that you need to make sure that it may be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder to a local file tree. it will only be saved in this file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a secure profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile are secured.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with a bunch. only the selected files and / or sub-folders are secured.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and select in the Menu...</seg>
<seg id="2908">As soon as the backup was initiated, the dialog opens up for backup. in this dialog you can even check the selected files and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">If you have confirmed the settings, the dialog appears to backup. the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives for the drive. it is checked only to select the selected file or folders.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the files named for the band with a bunch. only the selected files and / or sub-folders are checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry...</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the test procedure has started, the dialog appears for review. in this dialog you can check out your selection and change the work folder for review.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the settings for the review, the dialog appears check. this dialog shows the progress of the test process as well as the throughput and remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can slide the restore, the files that are supposed to be recovered. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder located in one of the archives created for the tape drive. it will only restore the selected file or sub-folders.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the required files from one of the archives with a bunch. only the selected files and / or sub-folders will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Click with the right mouse button on a file or folder in one of the archives and select in the menu Restore....</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the recovery process has started, the dialog appears for rebuild. in this dialog you can check out your selection and change the work folder for restoration.</seg>
<seg id="2920">If you have confirmed the settings for restoration, the dialog appears to restore progress. this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the throughput and remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it is necessary to create the band indexfile using the tape content. this process involves all existing Indexfiles for this band. you can rebuild the index to two types of tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This is a secure profile with the straight marked files and the default settings. you can make the following settings for a secure profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder where backup is to be carried out. list of the files being updated automatically according to the chosen work folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all the folders listed under backup files, only the files are stored on the same file system, such as the folder. file, which are located on other file systems, can be set separately on backup files. each entry will be viewed from tar independent of the other.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have been changed since the last incremental backup file, a snapshot file is secured. only the files have been secured since ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file, which is used to determine the changes since the last inincremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before the call of tar. this causes that all files will be secured and created a new snapshot file for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of buttons files are logged; and lt; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">The settings can be set via the menu item KDat... in the menu settings. the following settings can be made:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The full path to the device file for the tape drive (normally / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-rewinding variant of the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, transmits & kdat; before the tape can be connected to the drive. when some drives, this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is enabled, tries & kdat; it may not work on tape drives. possibly, this setting does not work with all band drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is switched on, when loosening the integration of & kdat, the band is automatically cast out; use this option for floppy streaks.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is enabled, tries & kdat; not all drives support variable blocksizes. no matter whether this setting is active or not, you need & kdat; in any case the log size for your belt drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">When & kdat; a band is formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of tape. this file should only prove a memory block on the tape. the contents of the file is composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(N byte) The band ID. the format of this string is hostname: seconds, whereby computer name is the full name of the system, on which the band has been formatted on which the band has now passed since the time has been formatted since the epoch.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file named $HOME / .kdat file using the same name.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives that can be directly connected with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work, as long as it is not for incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a backup association. this symbol is only active when a band is mounted.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& ksloglog - is a & kde; the program is suitable for unexperienced users who can not know where you can receive information on your system or where the system allows the different protocol-files. in addition, the system enables quick access to informations about problems that appear on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystem log; helps users to understand what your computer is in the background. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who can not know where you can receive information on your system or where system releases the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystem log; experienced users for quick access to informations about problems that appear on their server. & ksystem log; therefore, some extended functions can be filtered and evaluated using the protocol files of certain programs.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1, the system log log. a range of useful features include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other features are also included in addition, and are explained in the other chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you see in the following screen picture shows & ksystem log; features available, with the help of the individual protocol lines of a protocol file, can easily filtering and sort the individual options for sorting and filters will be shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After launching the system log log, first the main protocol-file system - the system protocol - will not be displayed, and it opens up instead of its a small news window, so you did not run with system administrator right. the protocol files can usually run under Linux normally in the folder / var / log, for the normal user no justification for reading.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter according to a limited range of criterion or according to the configured string. in the default setting, the selection box will be displayed next to the selected filter. in default, a protocol line will be displayed only if in one of the columns the strings of the filter search term is included.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry to this site. select the strings of the filter search term will then only select the entries in the same column. select an example in the filter bar called the name of a process, thus shows & ksystem log; all protocol lines, which were sent or produced by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines. protocol-lines of level error are displayed with a remarkable colour as a protocol-lines of level indication. the background images of protocol-lines can be switched off.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to display only certain process (e.g. in the system protocol or in cron protocol), so you can use the process identification (PID) in the column process, for example, if you want to examine the output of a specific command, such as the start of the samba server. in this case you will use the filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Furthermore, you can jump the option to new lines in the context menu of the main window, to show up all new protocol lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksloglog - allows you to use multiple protocol files into separate subwindows. to use this function, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage. as soon as you have selected a window, select a protocol to display in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystem log; has its own website on http: / / kslog.forum-software.or.Dort you will find more current information about the sources of sources & ksystem log;</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystem log; can also be found in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion archive: ksystem log; in & kde; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; system V Init Editor, rather well known (and the following also named) as & ksysv; this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv;</seg>
<seg id="2957">The system V Init develops quickly to the standard for control of program start in the world & Linux; therefore, because it is easier to use, more powerful and even more flexible than the traditional BSD -Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further on historical aspects (e.g. because I don't know about it): -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The inite binaries under / sam and not under / etc. this is therefore important because perhaps someone could try to set a machine on system V init, without creating a new installation and new format. that's why you need to be sure that the old init was removed from there, if there was there one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SYSV Init also distinguishes itself from the BSD init that the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc are instead directly in / etc. this folder means rc.d, you will find rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a complete set of scripts. basically you will need to launch a script for any system service, you want to start the system or change to another runlevel. system services include such things as network, NFS, & Hmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things as setserial, which is only once started. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should not lie down on / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems possess this file even if there is not much use for this. you can also want to put a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a bit if you want to do something with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is searching for different places after the program init and starts the first that he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is listed in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can take a look into the second column and probably determine that the pre-installed runlevel 3 is. if you want to change the default changes, then you can fix it, then you'll fix it by reboot the system and run the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start now all the correct scripts? if you enter -l in rc3.d, then you will probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that in this folder don't have the right files. instead, each entry here is a link to one of scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stops init actually system services? quite simple: each scripts are so written that it is a argument like start and stop. you can start this scripts actually off by hand on the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would hold the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the K contains, the script will be called with the argument. if it includes a S, the script will be called using the argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people require a simple way to create machines for many purposes. I could have a server-level, that can run only httpd, network & etc;, network & etc;, network & etc;, network & eg; & kdm;, network & etc; starts.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn the use of & ksysv; you should not be very difficult because the program was designed so user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer, is simple to say no trivial: simply drag an entry from the area of availability system services to one of the six runlevel to launch it on this level (or stop at).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move the scripts between Runes or the position within one level by moving it differently. this is the entry of its original runlevel (or its position). this is done not only if they draw an entry from the area of availability system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries will be postponed if you select it in a new area. to select it only to a new runlevel, you need to select copying from the menu menu or from the context menu -- even then, if the same entry has already existed in the target range of action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting-number of a single entry can be sometimes not calculated. in such a case you need to edit the sorting numbers in the environment before you can try again to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to restore entries that were thrown into the paper basket. be careful therefore.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab button to activate the different operating ranges (Available system services, runlevel 1 start, runlevel 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to meet a selection above or below the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move one entry into another round-level, move it with cutting into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it into the desired round level with insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the input number or the name of a single entry, press the input button to switch between different fields. close the dialog by clicking on the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to refuse the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the menu file require a confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. preferences will be taken if they are available. otherwise they will be recovered by & ksysv; changes to the default settings are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard laptops, and now the machine starts constantly. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Give the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input key to start in single-use mode. then edit the / etc / inittab and change the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; available at runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution.</seg>
