although I visited the United States since 2012 at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love to America is exceptionally big .
as many of my generation , I grew up with American films , played with American music and operated by American authors .
in fact , this country had a significant pro@@ found effect on me that I became mainly because of an American film journalist .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington like he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican Letter , a fear@@ less re@@ porter , who had covered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspi@@ racy of a oil @-@ Magn@@ um to occupy the Supreme Court with judges who had its interest to his interest .
I was caught .
free to Method One , &quot; I was as if that is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that is what I want to do with my life . &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona , my ad@@ mir@@ ation for the USA had only intensi@@ fied .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country where I have ever lived , whose variety is so welcoming that you are always one who you are and it is easy acceptance in a community of equal people .
I even had a very sh@@ ear love story about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
a lot was written about the x@@ en@@ op@@ ho@@ bia and the rac@@ ism of this man .
the most unusual aspect of his asc@@ ension is to me as he walks with its narrow face .
he doesn &apos;t keep his mind behind the mountain as you say so beautiful .
he says exactly what he thought , like a former colleague , express his express his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ amer@@ and women .
nevertheless , people responded to his statements and approved in pairs for him .
the 13 million votes , who won the Republi@@ can Presi@@ dential elections , was the highest number one ever recorded by the party .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support these big@@ s per person , asked me ?
I could not bring Tr@@ ump and his voters not to be in line with the people I learned during my time in Phoenix .
as for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program that takes people from around the world , a deep stunning man with whom I could talk about Islam and his past .
also Tr@@ um@@ ps did not agree with the fact that Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er , &quot; agreed .
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to view the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ um@@ ps Int@@ ol@@ er@@ anz also stands in contrast to gener@@ osity , which I strug@@ gled with Sandy B@@ ahr , who strug@@ gles to the environment for her life , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like their son .
she still fits them to the engagement of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , which helped me with a lot of patience and suffering from my colleagues to get to the complexity of American life .
then Andrew L@@ eck@@ ey , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wis@@ er council helped me much in my career .
these people and those who have been displac@@ ed my love to America .
while Tr@@ ump gets tr@@ ump to the nominated republi@@ can Presi@@ dential candidates , they offer to me a hold , and the counter@@ part of its limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 , over 50 million Americans , mostly white , the presi@@ dency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of its cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the strug@@ gles with the idea that people had voted for Tr@@ ump , because they were either given its rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism , because they were ready to over@@ look these things , broke out for me almost the heart .
perhaps it is un@@ fair to describe the tr@@ ump voters as an R@@ assi@@ sts .
the people arrange themselves , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is super@@ fic@@ i@@ ally and respec@@ t@@ less and indicates in@@ ability to understand those who act in another way and act .
it shows the people that their wor@@ ries and fears about the hec@@ tic changes are not taken into account .
could it be that this elec@@ tors have voted to have voted for dr@@ ump , because they want to gain control of a country that has disappointed it ?
in other words , they wanted to say that they are still important in this America ?
maybe perhaps .
however , you can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ n@@ ick , who commented on the cruel decision to raise a man who can look down with cont@@ emp@@ t on those who look like it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Ed . ) : as much as &quot; re@@ jection of the white against all other eth@@ nic@@ ity ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wording made of white in memory of the White and whi@@ pl@@ ash , what is so much means like a s@@ lit trau@@ ma ) , as did the great Van Jones named that America did so great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
millions people around the world estimate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background you can always have , America means any welcome .
because this country chose to be twice the son of a Ken@@ yan twice the son of a Ken@@ ian@@ ity , whose story says himself , no@@ where else in the world would be possible .
however , with the Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , however , there is a huge part of white America this promise , saying : to Hell with many times , religious freedom and the whole term of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in the Americas after 9 / 11 the white man is back on the ru@@ der , they say .
in all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
at a demonstration for Hill@@ ary Clinton Mr. Khan had a word change with the human being .
Donald Tr@@ ump , my son , captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn had a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
the crowd responded with a loud voice no ! &quot;
&quot; do Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; br@@ ushed the crowd .
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered them .
have A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they called her and their voices were a loud voice .
&quot; if anyone who doesn &apos;t like to have a place in your America ? &quot;
he received an in@@ consist@@ ance and loud &quot; NO &quot; !
Mr. Khan closed with the words : &quot; thanks be to Mr. Tr@@ ump , isn &apos;t it your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the land , for which his son was fallen , sent him a message .
this is Tr@@ um@@ ps country , saying the message .
and all the people that look like Mr. Khan , could no place in this new America .
and that break@@ eth me my heart .

out of the mis@@ ery to the stars : these Latin American children do not leave their love for the music by tr@@ ash .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero municipality in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an city of Cat@@ e@@ ura ?
that the music that is played in both places , not only the life of the children has changed , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill , only 16 kilometres south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city that is popular among tourists is very popular - but worlds away from the nearby pre@@ colonial Ru@@ ins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for some years now the La B@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( Musik@@ ban@@ de ) has now been playing in the community , one of children and adults , existing symph@@ ony orchestra , which has been an opportunity to overcome poverty with their musical instruments .
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest to the community of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the commune , located in one of the p@@ oo@@ rest provinces of Mexico , is known for its drugs abuse and the ban@@ kers .
but this changed after an acci@@ dental meeting with a French pilots , who started a musical project , and the youth thus offered a rare hope .
the young band members take up their obligations towards the music group , the local press release Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI writes :
once they come from the school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to keep their huge passion .
they always come and play with shiny eyes and play in the deceit they learn day for day trumpet , tromb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , Bon@@ g@@ os and the Con@@ ga .
music from W@@ aste
more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village which is practically located on the largest gar@@ bage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in the capital city - on instruments which are made of recycled waste material :
music with recovered instruments which consist of local solid waste materials , manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura where the recycling started under the bat@@ on of F@@ avi@@ o Chávez to transform the parts of the waste in instruments .
the instruments mentioned viol@@ inist , viol@@ as , C@@ elli , double b@@ asses , gu@@ itars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trumpets , tromb@@ ones and percussion which were all produced from the gar@@ bage .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ an and Latin American music and music of the Beatles , by Frank Sin@@ atra etc .
in an article in the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Chávez re@@ members a local dig@@ iti@@ ologist and musicians of the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura , at the early time :
first it was very difficult because we had no room for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach at the same place to contact the parents in the gar@@ bage , The children did not know any music and it was very difficult to contact their parents , because many of them do not live with their children .
that changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown something that he had never seen before : a tr@@ ash made of waste .
today there is a whole orchestra that plays on instruments from recovered material and is called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
a documentary N@@ ames &quot; Land@@ scape Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic refuse dump ) shows the musical performance :
the world generates about one billion tonnes of rub@@ b@@ ish each year .
those who are with him and of him are the p@@ oo@@ rest , such as people in Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
Land@@ scape Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspir@@ ing spectac@@ le of tr@@ ash @-@ zu @-@ music around the world .
Orchestra has played his music even before Pope Francis :
these Eastern African countries show how technology and team@@ work can tackle the illegal fishing industry
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that fighting wild illegal fishing industry .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that provides targeted solutions for environmental problems .
the re @-@ release occurs during an agreement with global Vo@@ ices for common use of content .
at that time , in West Africa , it was already known that this ship had been operated in li@@ br@@ ate waters of illegal fishing before it was looking forward to the other coast of Africa .
the Eastern African countries were correspon@@ d@@ ingly rising and inclined to be a little bit inclined by the crimin@@ als of this species to its coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ po@@ res , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and the Seych@@ elles mobil@@ ized rapidly against the ship . they refused to share one of their har@@ bours and refused to share a fishing boat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Premier was surrounded by countries that you simply have refused to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rec@@ alls the Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan fish@@ eries authority . it is part of a team that discovered the ship of stone and persecuted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was driven out from the waters of the region : it was not able to catch the fish there .
finally , it was forced to pay USD 2 million to Liberia , because of pill@@ aging the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , the criminal practices and resources protects and was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO stop illeg@@ itim@@ ate F@@ ishing ( Il@@ legal Fish@@ eries ) .
the members of this network are alongside Somalia and Madagascar the six countries , who then exp@@ elled the Premier out of their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries , who are bal@@ lo@@ red and are working together . they change information and stand on each other with where it goes to illegal fishing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Tony Long , Head of P@@ ew Char@@ ian Tru@@ sts project En@@ ding illeg@@ ally . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is regulated by definition : what is caught , is hidden , so that illegal fishing is a main cause of over@@ fishing regions .
a deliber@@ ation of existing laws , by which certain hab@@ itats and types are to be protected , the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems will harm a delicate balance .
however , during actions against the illegal fishing industry , the actions were ob@@ stru@@ cted by bureau@@ cr@@ atic hur@@ d@@ les , and even by the snow @-@ bureau@@ cracy , the actions occurred today in real time , with tra@@ ce@@ able on F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , the individual countries can exchange with each other , for example , to susp@@ ect lic@@ ate lic@@ ences , news to susp@@ ect activities or details , which can be noticed at an port inspec@@ tions .
fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very atten@@ tive if they move on the open sea , with satellite data .
this allows to mark the authorities to describe vessels that are fishing in forbidden areas - such as suspected drivers discover - such that a ship will show its caught fish on the road to other ships .
in ide@@ als such investigations show whether the participating ships have a fishing licence where they were on the way and possibly even if they have a criminal law .
countries that are against illegal fishing can be found on the basis of these information then that the ships can not be sold in their har@@ bours . what means that the ships can not be sold their charge , and that they could even be forced to the numbers of pen@@ alties , as in the fall of the Premier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then there are significant financial losses for the owner , meaning that the illegal fishing catch is fin@@ anci@@ ally no longer worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that &apos;s what we want to reach , &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , leader director of NF@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm which places the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supported F@@ ISH @-@ i .
a closed Front
the already mentioned platform was created to win an estimated 20 million USD to lost sales , which lose eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i every year due to illegal fishermen who penet@@ rating the waters into East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fishing companies that attracts since the region &apos;s commercial fish catch . among these also i@@ illeg@@ itim@@ ate fishermen .
among others , actions are counted as the sail under the false flag , f@@ eit lic@@ papers , indication of ph@@ ak@@ ien@@ en@@ ames , fishing @-@ protected species and the fish in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you use the lack of international cooperation and make the weakness of a non @-@ qualified control system &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ship was illegal and a country could say &apos; You must not run my port . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; and exactly this leg@@ ale Schl@@ u@@ pf@@ l tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i now .
so far the closed front works .
since its inc@@ eption F@@ ISH @-@ i was involved in more than 30 investigations of susp@@ ects .
it has revealed a criminal networks , which had counter@@ f@@ ake lic@@ ences in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several fr@@ au@@ dul@@ ent ident@@ ities , and found its wing@@ ed ships .
due to its collaboration with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the International Authority to combat crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing beyond large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations show us quite far into the networks of organiz@@ ational crime &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it builds a system , the F@@ ISH @-@ i is to help exp@@ orting ships ever precise .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is always developed further , helps to split the illegal ships to hide themselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Il@@ legal Fischer use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tra@@ cking , a N@@ RO which also offers with fish@@ eries and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships switch for example its automatic identification systems , where they can no longer be controlled by satellite .
Cop@@ eland helps to build a system that links different information . there is to help F@@ ISH @-@ i help to find crimin@@ ating ships with greater precision .
a model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations actually can influence influence on the und@@ ou@@ bt@@ edly global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the platform Global F@@ ishing Watch with Google and the Oc@@ e@@ ana Sea Protection Organization : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed by means of each individual tra@@ ce@@ able ship@@ ments worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; go to the neigh@@ bors to get a better image of it , who &apos;s what does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says he . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to un@@ ite and to bund@@ le their resources to the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should do this in global level . &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ ly Tru@@ sts has a similar project to run on which a global system allows persecution of ships .
there is signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities are not only crime nov@@ els , but they also cri@@ es off .
ships that had previously been explo@@ ited without a license and hardly any consequences with consequences , we know that they will be observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH @-@ i have now gained a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries , since then fishing boats more licenses .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia helped to split Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found there on board locks , whose use is prohibited .
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
other countries have also noted these successes . &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also have other countries , &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; we have become an study project . &quot; in West Africa , we will disappear several hundred million dollars annually through illegal fishing .
in 2015 , six countries have joined together , to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they also fight against illegal fishing , after exactly the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; With safety , the aim is to create even more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s most recent member states saw his first big triumph : in October , there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship used under the false flag . and not only the ship was used without a license and have been used to@@ w networks , which are now prohibited .
the ship was still reserved in forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; with the notice of measure against Gre@@ ko 1 we set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fish catch , &quot; says Ber@@ gh .
for F@@ ISH @-@ i , this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a special , collab@@ orative work to protect the oceans actually works in the entire world . Emma Br@@ yce is a professional journalist and lives in London . there she writes about the environment , technology and nutrition .
their article will appear in Wi@@ red Magazine , T@@ ED Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . location in Venezuela will go ahead to : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of conquer the country . &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of fierce demonstrations .
they are regarded as a protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum on the Presidency of the President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

after the government of Venezuela on a referendum to be rejected by the government of Venezuela , the Ven@@ z@@ ol@@ ans re@@ acted , in whose eyes the negotiations carried out on the political and economic crisis of the country , in which they gathered themselves together on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the reverse supply of Venezuela ) can be found in both these demonstrations and arguments for and against them .
the debate is also led in other parts of the country - amongst others in the eastern region of Bar@@ inas , in the center of Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , centrally located north of the federal state Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ part@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country deterior@@ ates continuously , what is noticeable in everyday life of vene@@ ers through a acute short@@ age of food and medic@@ ations .
many representatives of the opposition saw in the official adoption of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , a chance for a fundamental change ; finally , however , the re@@ aring of a new election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ acting at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises the context of the governmental treaty in the following article :
as part of the social , political and economic crisis , the inflation rate is to be found in the highest part of the world ( the inflation rate is estimated to be 500 % on the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine has been considered the only way to conquer their institutional structures and close a new government alliance .
the election of Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Bo@@ á@@ tica or short Mu@@ d ( about : round Table of the Democratic Unity ) to join forces to the National Assembly . in addition , the trial against President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro took part in the way , and a march to the Mira@@ flo@@ res Palace , the Venezuel@@ an government seat , will continue to continue on November 3 , the blocking of the refer@@ end@@ ums to the minist@@ ration proceedings .
the call was published on Twitter , as follows :

the first demonstration in the context of the Action program &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; took place on Wednesday 26 October .
the images of the mar@@ ches that will be published in real time , testify among others an overwhelming involvement of people in numerous areas of the country , but also disp@@ utes with polic@@ emen as well as fears of the government .
one of the most frequently divided images shows a demonstr@@ ators who calls through the protective shield : &quot; will you kill me because I have hunger ? &quot;

particularly large waves beat the message through police suppression in the central @-@ central town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
in there , demonstr@@ ators went back to the local Cathedral in order to protect themselves from the police and armed fears of the government .
hours later , they were able to leave the cathedral back safely , but the protests were continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ den@@ state T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira bear no coats , because otherwise it could not have something many national@@ ities !
meanwhile , an inf@@ ographic about the round that forms the extent of suppression per day :
so the dictatorship was supp@@ ressed .
many representatives of the government had agreed the validity of the demand for a minist@@ erial procedure in question - this has been demonstrated in the eyes of many by the presence of inn@@ um@@ erable people on the road .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Labs found :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado de claims that 1 % of the signatures are counter@@ f@@ ited .

other values of this protests as a further step in the fight against a government which made a little bit against the devastating economic crisis and would prefer to deal with critical voices :
they have taken us so much - but also the fear of fear !
mar@@ ches always take more of frequency and intensity .

this is an adapted version of an interview of Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano , the origin of the origin was published on August 23 , 2016 at D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argentine news page .
the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
when he was 15 years old Luis Alberto Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father , the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argentine city Córdoba .
as an adult man , Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano said in the context of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ribera trial in the province of Córdoba , against his father .
the trial which ended on 24 August 2016 were committed to crimes committed during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano has not been sought out his life .
starting with the office , same name as his father can carry up to the brutal military per@@ missions in the prison La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 he suffered enough .
he kept the family &apos;s secret for 34 years .
in the situation then I believed that was in order .
I felt like a secret mag@@ ician .
as a child with 15 years you don &apos;t notice that one is manip@@ ulated by his father .
I could not know that my father was a thief , fol@@ ky and rob@@ bers .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ an@@ eri@@ e@@ er . during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of state terrorism , his father was Deputy Commander of the Intelligence Division 141 in prison La Per@@ la .

this is not the story of Luis Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ pressed that was accused of kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in nearly 100 cases and kidn@@ apping of a 10 year old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qu@@ i@@ j@@ anos son , a man who had experienced the extent of atro@@ cities in the course of the years , which he had experienced as a boy , and who testified before a Federal Court against his own father .
his story shows what great power has a parent over his child , and as this child chose a way to redemption .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father began to participate in the military base , I often went with us to the sports hall . there , I had rounded off with a boy , the mar@@ tial arts .
all they called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him , and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are a dick@@ head , you have been wounded with one of the ERP .
pass only that they may not lead you one day , and I must save you .
the ab@@ brevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revolutionary ci@@ on@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo , the Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Revolutionary Workers Party of Argentina .
therefore he for@@ b@@ ade me to go back to the gym . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he said to me , I would be my secret .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . for so my father had moved me .
in the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard the cap@@ tives .
these were all possible documents : University conclu@@ des , handwritten notes , literature , certificates , prop@@ aganda , books , simply all .

&apos;@@ Where , the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
my father took me four times after La Per@@ la , all in 1976 .
during the first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he commanded me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ racks , in the cars , furniture , television , fri@@ dges - simply all possible - stood .
all of it was stolen .
he gave me a small blan@@ ket in a blan@@ ket , and ordered me to carry it into the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a large cl@@ ums@@ y silver .
on that day , I went to the other end of the Bar@@ ac@@ ke , where the stolen objects were turned and under@@ ed me with a juni@@ per .
suddenly he interpreted in an open space and said :
there the prisoners were tor@@ tured .
I went in and saw a song where people were tor@@ tured .
she looked like a field @-@ bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they paved the one end of a cable . the other end was fast@@ ened at the body of the person who had just taken there .
they had a man connected to the bed , shot him with water and pursued it a charge of 220 volts to the gen@@ ital@@ ia .

the stri@@ fe there was horri@@ fic ... as a dirty win@@ del .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same od@@ our came out of his room .
I recognized the smell immediately and I became clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is it possible only that a man can do so much evil ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ I knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were frozen and were attached .
he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; L@@ op@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pe@@ z , an civilians who was also accused in the trial ) and I used the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a series of matt@@ resses , which were naked people with the face down - all were in hands and feet .
close to the input , people remain silent on the matt@@ resses .
when my father noticed that I saw a prisoner , he said , &quot; Why do you like this ? &quot;
I met &quot; Why have you brought me ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed by soldiers .
I know this because my father told her home .
besides La Cu@@ ad@@ ra there were some rooms that were referred to as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero &quot; killed there a man and killed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to the survi@@ vors of the civilian , the civilian is Jorge Rom@@ ero which was also charged in the La Per@@ la @-@ Ribera trial , the Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Molina was arrested .
in the following video , Emilio F@@ essi@@ a , the leader of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former Fol@@ lowing chambers .
the path where you come to enter , is also the way that we arrived here .
if you look at the map , see that they took about this track and were tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the trial .
when they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ bo@@ ra , until the arrangement of the above came to be transferred .
this was the lie - the Eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of people and the dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; war@@ fare &apos;
my father brought all kinds of stolen things by home .
at that time I had no idea of what the &quot; war@@ fare &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was later in the military , I was in the g@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - I was clear that war@@ fare is a B@@ aj@@ on@@ ett or perhaps military badge , which is strug@@ gled with an enemy that you have been fighting .

but if one go into a house and the refrigerator , the record player , clothing , painting , money ... pin , then there is no war , but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I have always asked how my father , the leader of security forces , could perform in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was a officer in the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never forget to enter into a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do it .
once he called me a crime and I answered : and thou , whom you go on the street ?
you are not a crime ?
he explo@@ ded before rage , and killed me , and cried , saying ,
when you go so far , then I will find you and en@@ cro@@ oked you .
we need not need any other !
so my father was .
I have no only good memory to him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo of at that time , on which I had a jacket and a roller swe@@ ater from wool . both I had made my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothes with home .
at that time , the defence accused me to have been a prisoner with this crime . I said , no problem , they can lay down with me what they wanted .
I was so anyway to say .
&apos; the dis@@ appearance of the glue is the last ab@@ h@@ ous act &apos;
now , where I am older , I Reu@@ e .
I have children . if you only have children , one recogni@@ zes the value of a life .
one develops and det@@ ects that it is wrong , to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , in the dictatorship of the dictatorship , you have left ex@@ ek@@ u@@ ated during the dictatorship ? but what the bodies will disappear ?
why do children perform ?
one day my father brought a girl with her home , whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that a little girl was .
I turned back the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
they could just put it into prison .
I guess , it was just decided to kill these people . but to let your bodies disappear ?
had these people not even families who could not be handed to their remains ?
the dis@@ appearance of the glue is the last ab@@ h@@ or act that can be done to a man .
my father told me when the democracy was re@@ introduced to eliminate the mort@@ al remains of the det@@ ain@@ ees .
they were cr@@ ushed and somewhere else - no idea , where . &quot; you will never find something , &quot; said my father .
but anything remains of course .
&apos;@@ i &apos;ve seen how you killed man ! &apos;
just to declare it : I have nothing against the military .
I even was even at the g@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my father .
the idea of view my father was created during a conversation while he stood under house arrest .
I did for him because of all the atro@@ cities that I had to experience concerning him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt wor@@ ried and asked me , what the whole Patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; that they allegedly defend themselves , actually well .
then I cried :
how can you tell me ?
I &apos;ve seen how you killed man !
you have committed terrible crimes , and you have comp@@ elled me as a child to participate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh then follow me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did that .
in 2010 I paid the first ad .
I finally knew that he was a cr@@ ush@@ ers .
no one can submit to me that I am pre@@ operative . I finally said to my own father .
Luis Alberto Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano died under house arrest in May 2015 before the end of the trial .
he was charged with 416 pen@@ sions : including heavier , ir@@ relevant freedom of liberty in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 especially severe cases , torture with subsequent death sequence in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of a child under 10 years .

the judgments in the &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the Spanish order of the judgment .
after four years , in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ribera process ended for crimes against 7@@ 16 victims in August 1975 .
43 Supp@@ orts of crimes against humanity were found guilty of crimes against humanity , and sentenced to life imprisonment in 28 cases , and in nine cases of pen@@ alties ranging from 2 to 14 years . in six cases there was acqu@@ itt@@ al .
eleven of originally 54 def@@ endants were killed during the trial .
# La@@ Persian Jud@@ gment : murder , torture and rape with officers . # Es@@ War@@ state terrorism
all def@@ endants were killed during the dictatorship of the military , including former military , former police and civil employees .
Pier@@ o De Monti was kidn@@ apped and brought to La Per@@ la together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 .
he addressed the following words to the Swiss chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
the Court of Justice is a historical milestone in all human rights organisations which have been involved in justice for the victims for many years .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , founded in 1995 , founded the Argentin@@ ean organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , who became the children of men who were murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said :
the trial took more than three years , but the research took 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argentin@@ ean government issued the country on which La Per@@ la was able to create a memorial that is now managed by human rights organisations .

one translation error occurs older people in Kyoto with &quot; terrible drivers &quot;
the sign with the translation error in a centre in Kyoto , where you can extend his driving licence .
the photo was widespread in social media .
adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese town of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend his driving licence , in the last month witnesses of a very special translation .
on a sign the Japanese word ( both en@@ rol@@ ment@@ s@@ a ) , the &quot; older drivers &quot; means , perhaps - perhaps also with a big back thanks &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; fear@@ ful drivers &quot; translated .
the wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads in the entrance area and building itself from 1 to 20 September .
adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was dealt with in the social media .
the error was translator Julian Holmes , a resident Ky@@ ot@@ os , retired . it was also that the local newspapers made a atten@@ tive .
the daily Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n was published in Kyoto :
&quot; how could it come to such a English translation ?
this proves that nobody has read the translation .
this is an ins@@ ult of elderly people and an international city like Kyoto , &quot; said Holmes &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the def@@ ective English translation was initially removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the designation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate name , if the gram@@ m@@ atical &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ der drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) was replaced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police in the Kyoto Pre@@ fecture has changed for translation errors . furthermore it declared that the error was already contained in the text that they had been reviewed by the translator , and that the translation was not tested for their accuracy before it was released .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry that older people felt by the in@@ adequate correction ( the translation ) our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News set apart some more detailed with the phenomenon &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the word &quot; fear@@ ful &quot; was den@@ ounces as an adequate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of elderly people who are involved in accidents are being involved , but definitely concern for wor@@ ries .
in the Kyoto Pre@@ fecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 were caused by senior citizens in 2005 . this equ@@ ates to a percentage of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , senior citizens created 1.8@@ 03 from a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
this increased its share to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has decreased in total , the proportion of senior citizens caused accidents in the same period .
the nam@@ ing does not mentioned re@@ por@@ ters in the published version of the article comments on the light which show what are some Japanese seem@@ ingly seem@@ ingly against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo over the translation error was given the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) about the reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
- &quot; If any translation is really bad , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t think that this is a real translation error . &quot;
there is no such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gra@@ ish &quot; is widespread throughout Asia
translation errors have been widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a real mine of this bizar@@ re error in English .

the reasons for the wide spread of trans@@ lat@@ ors are diverse .
you need two important skills : passive voice knowledge to understand the output text and active voice knowledge to transfer him to the target language .
the latter requires remin@@ ders of the target language - something that is in native language . in general , the convic@@ tion is that trans@@ lat@@ ors should be in the target language - not in the language language - native language .
for instance , a French native language should transl@@ ate from English to French - not from the French to English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r users Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies employ no staff with English as a native language that could make translations into English . this may lack of understanding , cost reasons , or the relatively small number of English speakers that can learn Japanese .
some companies that have no foreign employees think , translations can still be fir@@ mation . then the Japanese staff whose English knowledge is the best to be trans@@ lat@@ ors - no matter how good or bad his language knowledge really are .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r users Karl Baron .
mach@@ ined translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
the ver@@ ed and en@@ ig@@ matic phr@@ ases that are created by mach@@ elle translations , show that this technology can still replace no human translator . this applies to some languages quite particularly .
some of the strange English phr@@ ases in Japan , including the cris@@ py prints , often used T @-@ shirts or pockets are only used for sty@@ li@@ stic reasons - not to be read or understood .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r users Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors like jewelry still acceptable or at least harm@@ less . but of large enterprises or from the government who have funds to ensure higher standards , one can expect more carefully .
the city of Kyoto uses a serious source of their translations in the future .
Venezuela : protests and cen@@ sored work on the Internet and Television
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ al con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to PRE@@ N@@ SA y Soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute of Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , April 7 , the Venezuel@@ an internet used that they had no access to the online transmitter of Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later , others wrote that the Internet coverage of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV be no longer accessible .
other online broad@@ caster over@@ took pictures of the protests in Caracas , which were organized by op@@ positi@@ onable groups , contra@@ cted by the Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros government .
the protests began in early April after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the tasks of Parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author of Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection is stuck , and receive the users to get access to the Internet , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the internet .
# C@@ ens@@ or@@ ship : activ@@ ates your VPN port .
it seems that Internet pages have to be closed again .
this is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers like Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among dental vene@@ ers with internet access , especially in times of distur@@ ban@@ ces .
traditional media have been involved in the coverage of protests . at that time , the Commission for T@@ elecommunic@@ ation initiated them with fin@@ es and closing statements , when the Commission would continue to report on demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as &quot; call for Viol@@ ence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels I registered with @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net again .
amazing that this is still cheaper than to buy two litres of Lim@@ on@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ te later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay due to a blocking of domain name system ( DNA ) is not accessible , but also two further online stations . this also concerns the website , on which the National Assembly transfers their meetings .
earlier follow @-@ up of the institute for press and society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , we had indicated that local internet providers had to use DNA . thus it is a technique due to the DNS server in@@ correctly answer certain domains .
if a website has been blocked by the DNS server , the server is incorrect , or ref@@ uses the request to call such a website .
we confirm a DNS lock : @ i@@ Mod@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third @-@ per@@ ed channel , the transfer was set on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ PI@@ TV channel El@@ vis Flo@@ res , who took the protests in Caracas , was put into prison .
Flo@@ res was beaten , while he was in custody for the police .
eight hours later , he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on show again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government is regulated , so the government is regulated by the dental vene@@ ers of access to multi media coverage over the current events in the country .
in Paraguay many girls will get too s@@ cler@@ ics for receiving a training
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a Cri@@ ad@@ ita for a child . now they visited the house where she worked for years .
today Tina is fought for the rights of children and collec@@ ts testimony of other Cri@@ ad@@ itas , who have been just as victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the shortened version of a report by short term , published by Global Vo@@ ices with courtesy of the authors .
the article is part of a series with the title &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; lying cows , disper@@ sed schools &quot; ) , which will be edited and published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where they were not together with the family that lived there .
shortly before her studies at the university , she once returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride on her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the one has become something &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old , she began working as Cri@@ ad@@ ita for the family . as Cri@@ ad@@ itas , in Paraguay the more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the shop is very simple : a large family with little money transfer her minor family or her min@@ der@@ son daughter to another , rich family . in exchange , the child will receive food , a training and a roof over the head .
however , what does not mention , that the children have to pay for countless days of house@@ work which will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that can &apos;t be raised within the context of a contract that you cannot raise .
this is known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go practices in Paraguay due to the involvement and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations .
after gradu@@ ating from their studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for an organization that f@@ ights for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ ad@@ itas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collect witness testimonies and ref@@ using .
she tried to call those things in the name , because the feeling of grat@@ itude to imp@@ lies the Cri@@ ad@@ itas , guarantees in general n@@ urs@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dis@@ appointment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since it is part of the family that her daughter in faith , that they may close their education , improve their position in society and can make something of itself , &quot; to another family . &quot;
on the other hand , the family , which takes up the girl with him and its exploitation with faith , that they would give someone a chance that otherwise would have no training , and maybe even was hungry .
the Vic@@ tims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is har@@ assed , his family will be experienced many years later .
sometimes they never experienced them .
in January 2016 , this was so far relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the bor@@ row in par@@ agu@@ an households , but a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín was in the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed signs of heavy battles . shortly afterwards it died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the budget of the former military members of Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who is working as an officer for the resident tax office .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in their home in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small place with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital of As@@ unci@@ ón .
on the end of January 2016 Fer@@ re@@ ira proposed to Mar@@ ín as long as he suffered a dead@@ ly injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
some days later the media reported about the incident .
they thought that the murdered child was a Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
organisations such as UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deeply ro@@ oted in the par@@ agu@@ an Society of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go &apos;s death for the death of the girl .
they recorded the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came to protest and demanded that there is no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos have been widespread in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , &quot; accused Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
without papers it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which terms , boys and girls live .
the neighbour &apos;s neighbours and nearly 60 civil society organisations called for a fast study of the case .
they want that Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was sentenced to 30 years in prison .
if the case comes before the Court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be landmark , when the first time in the history of Paraguay , a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is coming .
the daily life of a Cri@@ ad@@ ita
the Cri@@ ad@@ itas are not only carried out as a labour force , they also live isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bik was working in which their father had to sign up , and their father lost its work .
your brothers had to work now all work and started to sell on the street or on the market swe@@ ets to earn money .
but they all went on to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón in the capital of As@@ unci@@ ón .
in the house of their employer Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day .
they had to share the time so that you still remained the time to learn .
they rose every morning against five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for their employer .
Friday to the example , pur@@ ified the refrigerator , plaster the living room , polished the furniture and the infected bottom .
when the school was at the end , she went back home and had time to learn .
the more time they were finished with learning , the more free time .
but this time was limited , because she had to make dinner for their employer .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says that they had never been hungry , but did not receive unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the library of the master &apos;s library as a meal from the fridge , &quot; she reminds us .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the house@@ holder , a former Military and sympath@@ izers of Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , which was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who belonged to the opposition from 1954 until 1989 .
on some evenings of the house@@ holder Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , next to him and guides from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; or &quot; El Pueb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to persu@@ ade them to convince the reports of the official media over the regime of dict@@ ator .
he held her for intelligent , but not with her . &quot; the house@@ holder had found someone who talked about politics while he spoke about politics . &quot;
&quot; they permitted me not often to visit my family , because they were the opinion that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a would have to learn that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who belongs to the indigenous group of gu@@ ar@@ í , would return to her native language gu@@ ar@@ í .
they feared the Lord that they had allowed her to lose her again , explains them .
however , it was completely clear that she had paid for everything they had paid by them at their hard work .
also in school Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a discrimin@@ ated . &quot; a thing that is never spoken about the almost never talked , are mo@@ b@@ bing and the ic@@ ans that Cri@@ ad@@ itas are suspended when they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they recognize immediately that someone who has no parents , is a cri@@ ad@@ ita .
I could not invite you to home . I had no friends at school in school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time where friends arise , I felt very clear that I belonged to no group .
the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; says Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
the company endor@@ se the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a fac@@ ebook group , in which one can share st@@ aves for cleaning staff and children &apos;s girls in Paraguay .
the administrative division in the group is Pep@@ a Kost@@ ian@@ ov@@ sky , a city tour in the district of As@@ unci@@ ón .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a small companion for my little daughter who plays in the morning and afternoon with her .
to learn .
please tell you .
starting from Monday if possible .
the ad was given five &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the village Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a year @-@ old girl and gave her telephone number .
another woman who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
in the third commentary &quot; a girl from the state of the inner , I want to work . &quot;
then the author was post@@ pon@@ ed once again :
Dear friends , I found one . I look when it works with her .
thank you , I am writing again if something is .
the shop was completed .
in the Pro@@ log report to the report Cri@@ ad@@ itas , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ?
( Cri@@ ad@@ itas , as long as ? ) , a collection of witness statements , former Cri@@ ad@@ itas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z :
in the course of our history , we managed to abol@@ ish systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the Spanish conqu@@ ist@@ ador that had to be looked at the Spanish conqu@@ ist@@ adors in Paraguay ) and the system of the Mens@@ a ( in which the Spanish conqu@@ ist@@ adors in Paraguay ) had to give tribute that many girls and boys had to settle into a system of slavery in which they are easy victim to abuse and exploitation .
the social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and the look at the show have known the key to understanding of the phenom@@ ena known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill writes Egyptian users social media to register at the government
picture of Pix@@ ab@@ ay , modified by Global Vo@@ ices .
published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
sixty Egyptian parliamentary coun@@ ters have recently approved a bill to &quot; regul@@ ators concerning the use of social and social networks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he is accepted by Parliament , users must register social media in Egypt to a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the basis of the law , a place would then be set up in order to share social media , citizens and citizens .
within six months with acceptance of the law , users have to register for users on the site of the site with their right name and number of staff numbers to use social networks .
if it f@@ ails to do this , this could bring a penalty of up to six months &quot; imprisonment or a fine of money .
the bill , consisting of six paragra@@ phs , and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt independent , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application , which runs over the internet and is used to communicate with others by voice , video editing and text . &quot;
it is un@@ clear how the law is passed when it is assumed , since the draft has no indication of how to account the Egyptian authorities to provide users who are not able to register for the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure regulation on the level of the social media company .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Zah@@ ar , parliamentary elections and sponsors of the law , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a user name and a password to get through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt is planning to judge a fire@@ wall at national level around Facebook . due to them , it would be necessary to submit information on their identity to access the network .
but it is not known so far that such plans exist .
experts on site are sk@@ ep@@ tical concerning the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the pre@@ lu@@ ent .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Engine@@ er ( in German &quot; Leading Research Officer &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , on German &quot; Egyptian Initiative &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices :
I highly concentrate on the technical capacity and the understanding of neither the authority in Egypt concerning things which have to do with technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that same as they could control both physical public and private rooms , it could also be done online .
if I contact them , then this means that they will receive a strong monitoring system to make citizens free or not . and this means a mad system to monitor the activity of mankind and also to maintain a court process .
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
in order to be adopted as a law , the draft plan must first be discussed at the legislative elections and the constitutional committees before it enters the debate .
whether its assum@@ ption and implementation will be successful or not , the draft &quot; stands in line with a pro @-@ military monument in parliament , in which the meaning has been increased and ensured that no different sc@@ ration is present on the image surface , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .

high above in the mountains of the region Kurdistan in the northeast of Iraq work the animal protection H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and her team of scientists from non @-@ governmental organisation Nature Iraq to protect the spiritu@@ ally saved Persian Leop@@ ards .
a sub@@ type of the larger family of Leop@@ ards , which goes through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . in total , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are based on account of Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and the frag@@ mentation of their hab@@ itat , as they are always less prey .
why is this particular type of le@@ op@@ ards so important ?
as R@@ aza in the video shows , &quot; is the Persian Leopard the only remaining rob@@ ber@@ y in the Kur@@ dish ecos@@ ystem &quot; and the health and the growth of ecos@@ ystem . it depends on that a large rob@@ ber@@ y is present .
the chance to see a Persian Leop@@ ards in fact is little and goes against zero . as a team at the video , she is a recording of a large cat in the camera af@@ all , R@@ aza is pure in pure joy .
as a trained Bi@@ olog@@ in , R@@ aza is passionate about a different page of their country that is not only in war and conflict .
she has been involved in wild animals and educational programmes of Nature Iraq for six years .
since 2013 , she has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and is preparing that protection zones for wildlife will be set up in the Kurdistan Region .

in early March 2017 , the daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ ann@@ o , which was achieved for the nor@@ theastern Japan , the adv@@ ances that were affected in the last six years . a massive earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima happened the disaster .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ ann@@ o @-@ Zeitung has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which is in the Pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , was an unusual pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s northeast , which had to experience the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neigh@@ bors of Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate have been evacu@@ ated , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had to disappear all coastal cities from the map .
in addition , the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture had a nuclear accident , already alone , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses .
the special report of K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ ann@@ o shows a local view that reaches progress of six years later to re@@ build the life of local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes both the statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as the survey results of the affected themselves .
the housing structure in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ ann@@ o @-@ Zeitung reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned spare parts ( Cor@@ respon@@ dence , Cor@@ y@@ ag@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei y@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) was completed in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could be the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed .
I@@ w@@ ata has completed 75 percent of these houses , while being at Fu@@ kus@@ hima , with 70 percent of its final light .
it is , even six years after the cat@@ astrophe , evacu@@ ated of the camps ( which documents , kas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in final substitute houses .
after the triple cat@@ astrophe , nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in accommodation .
in December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate in such containers .
almost 40 percent of the evacu@@ ation origin@@ ate from Fu@@ kus@@ hima still lives in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ated evacu@@ ated houses , which were sub@@ du@@ ed after the disin@@ teg@@ ration , were converted into final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the figure is 34 percent here .
the stand of work and daily life in the three concerned pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ ann@@ o @-@ Zeitung could determine 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , which were affected by mis@@ fortune , its doors to December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
while almost 100 percent of fishing companies in I@@ w@@ ata and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i have now been operating in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , only 30 per cent of fishing ports have been re@@ registered in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident have moved in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures agricultural land .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas where only 66 percent of the farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed ar@@ able land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
it is un@@ likely that only a result of the atomic fact is , since only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed ar@@ able land of Fu@@ kus@@ hima in the nuclear @-@ armed zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures the tourism has recovered all again , but Fu@@ kus@@ hima still remains ro@@ uted .
the tourist figures in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are back up to 90 percent on the same level as before the mis@@ fortune . Fu@@ kus@@ hima happened here only 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ ann@@ o @-@ Zeitung reports that since the cat@@ astrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it is more difficult to earn their hab@@ itat .
is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
in order to determine a complete design , the newspaper conducted numerous surveys under the native population and under the evacu@@ ation . she asked them about the stand of re@@ building and , as their Emp@@ ower has changed over against the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in her introduction of article the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ ann@@ o conducted a survey in order to bring more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the native people in experience .
the survey conducted that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents spoke to be prepared in order to be prepared for the future earthquake and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.9 percent of respon@@ dents say that there was still not enough in cat@@ astroph@@ es health prevention .
as it is about those who had to be evacu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture
in its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake that K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ ann@@ o @-@ Newspaper has strengthened its attention also on the position of the evacu@@ ation of Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
Fu@@ kus@@ hima still had to experience the massive earthquake and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima was also a witness of the worst , cat@@ astroph@@ ic disorder , which had to be done in Japan .
of 160 000 evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima , almost 63 000 people were moved out outside the pre@@ fecture .
at the beginning of 2016 there were more than 23 000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , had been converted into durable replacement houses .
according to the 2017 stand , 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live outside their hom@@ eland pre@@ fecture .
most of the evacu@@ ation areas are the most of the evacu@@ ated plants , older than 50 years old . they must compete in proper accommodation because the efforts have to compete for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima with massive construction projects . this is to be part of the Olympic Games which will be held in Tokyo in 2020 .
the world is small : our po@@ d@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
if men meet from other countries that speak another language , the differences seem to be greater than the simil@@ ar@@ ities .
however , after a while , one recogni@@ zes that more , one more combines it at first sight .
these global connections are important to demand for our pre @-@ parts , our perspectives and recall that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look forward to these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we treat topics that often get less attention in the reporting period .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they felt very strongly linked to someone above language and country borders .
Veron@@ ika Kri@@ kon@@ i speaks about the simil@@ ar@@ ities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i Camar@@ asa reminds about the time that they worked with people from all over the world ; Adri@@ ana M@@ aci@@ as tells about the time where they worked with people from around the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b is looking back to his experiences that he collected in a small village in Madagascar .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in artificial coma , after being joined by the police in nationwide demonstrations
left : the attack against Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva . photo : Lu@@ iz da Luz . publication with approval .
right : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva in a widespread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week into the intensive care unit : last Friday , a police officer had been defeated at a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia during a demonstration against the head . in the nationwide , millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest against au@@ mb@@ s .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who studied social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma and several fra@@ c@@ tures .
doctors under@@ took him this Saturday and now put him into an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local journalist Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which spread rapidly within a few days quickly in Brazil .
the images also shows the face of the police officers , which was identified with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after incident the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had suspended until the conclusion of the incident of the active ministry .
the pictures show the police officers , such as he strikes in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his impact on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
would a police officers have a demonstr@@ ators , and in the intensive care unit , his face would be on display for six months , and the whole of the repression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ol@@ al@@ iz@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , divided the video on the net in which you see how Mat@@ eus is attacked by police officers and several wash@@ es shortly after him .
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from another perspective , is also immersed in social networks .
in the bottom shown clip you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus down the 50th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus who lives in another state , Internet users have donated 10.000 Braz@@ ilians Re@@ ais ( approximately 2,@@ 700 euros ) to allow a portion of the costs for medical treatment and to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while he is in hospital .
&quot; be vali@@ ant , Mat@@ eus .
against police custody . &quot;
the drawing was divided into several social networks .
by : H@@ eit@@ or Vil@@ ela . release with permission .
on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for other violent attacks against activ@@ ist in Go@@ i@@ ás :
Go@@ i@@ ás experienced a wave of political force : here the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me was murdered in secondary schools , because he was forced to sabot@@ age the Occup@@ y Movement in secondary schools . and now we have attacked the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who was attacked by a polic@@ emen who has attacked him with a polic@@ emen .
police gri@@ ps
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil where it arrived in the past Friday to brutal police courts against demonstr@@ ators .
polic@@ emen trained protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a stage for Red@@ ner , rubber handles and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
the Fl@@ avi@@ o Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( PS@@ OL ) , asked the police via speaker to refra@@ in violence against demonstr@@ ators .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ders de S. Paulo , one of the oldest papers in the whole country .
again , the Brazilian media streets once again dist@@ orted by introducing the focus on another , unexpected prot@@ agon@@ ists : a window disc .
the fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported targeted about a broken glass window , to illustr@@ ate it with a photo of its cover pages .
by contrast , the O Glob@@ o &apos;s title story with a set of a set in fire .
there is no pl@@ au@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a broken window disc than the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a specific thing .
this should also be seen if you stri@@ de against any form of damage .
the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; received a ab@@ sur@@ d , un@@ disp@@ rop@@ orous significance , and the typical violent actions of the military police are forced by head@@ lines with the &quot; demonstr@@ ators &quot; front@@ ation with the police . &quot;
the Vill@@ ages of Ent@@ in@@ du@@ str@@ o forgotten villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the Act of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso conducted nearly hundreds of sugar cane factories in the whole of Cuba ( Photo : Juli@@ o B@@ atist@@ a )
the community of Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ i , which is located in the western Cub@@ an province of May@@ abe@@ que , is commonly known as a Central - on Spanish sugar mill - known , regardless of that there is no significant sugar content on site .
it is two years ago when the activities were fabri@@ cated in the sugar cane factories .
after conservation , the sugar cane industry in the region remained silent , and the factory lost after and after its facilities , until the rum@@ ours of steel and concrete remained .
approximately 272 workers had to be re@@ inv@@ ent .
some changes the work .
other re@@ signed and comm@@ ute daily to the factories which are still grinding .
N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an who stands every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry did not work his sleep .
he heard that in the east of the region of sugar cane factories , which are back into operation after a long @-@ active time , because they have been received .
that was something he was not expected .
N@@ ene reminds us exactly that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ I would receive the sugar cane factory , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry already resistance to pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market prices , the in@@ efficiency , the poor administrative decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , production 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the 1910 produced quantity .
the message would have been a motive on some decades for the evidence for the country , but the bad har@@ v@@ ests have been no more new .
why was the Cub@@ an sugar industry switched off ?
the old platform of the commune saw even better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ atist@@ a )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economical need : the 155 sugar mills factories were technically ob@@ sol@@ ete , and hardly competitive they were in@@ portable for the country .
the initial idea was to focus on the most efficient factories , the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes .
they left only the factories which can produce sugar for maximum 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0,@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the moti@@ fs that led to such measures were the slight productivity of the sugar cane plants and the sugar crisis on the global market .
nevertheless the sugar price increased from about one decade ago .
by 2017 through 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar has to remain in between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the report &quot; Regional Policy Per@@ spectives &quot; from the OECD and FAO , the Agriculture and Food Organization of the United Nations .
if current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar cane would generate about 85 million dollars for the country .
not all ran well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s Day will go through security in history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of the Cub@@ an President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from there the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years , the shut@@ down from a total of 98 bodies of sugar mills , more than 65 million people received their full salary for further education .
the same happened in the sugar tube factory Gregori@@ o Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has been working in the factory since 1967 .
if N@@ ene , as it is known as a soldier , is talking about the closure of the factory , is the word which he repe@@ ats most , &quot; fr@@ aud . &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are in the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would shut down .
in order to obtain the place , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
prior to the beginning of the first year , the first letters began to come .
it was officially written by the official documents , which would only be made concerning the parts that would be removed from the add@@ sat and the date .
all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could appro@@ ve any removal .
from there the responsibilities were super@@ imposed on and the letters were more likely to be more common .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the feeding factory for two years , and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money , &quot; he as@@ sures them still in operation .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for the retirement in another complex , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was against his will in the breast@@ feeding of the factory in which construction he helped .
with every part he removed the dismant@@ led of one of his 31 years of work .
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and most important workplace producers have been extingu@@ ished .
in many cases , there were no alternatives for the working sites and services rendered in the municipalities in which they were present .
we will never know if during the mamm@@ oth talk of 21 October 2002 , the former president moved to the eyes of the present persons , when he guaranteed , that for the areas , whose factories were not in operation for five years .
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar cane mills
since 2004 , sugar cane is extracted only high by grinding .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ atist@@ a )
after two years the community of Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich lear@@ nt that many things change , but not always to better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar tube factory closed , or better , when they began to do it , they also list@@ ened to the asphalt road , this also dis@@ advant@@ age@@ ous other establishments .
without work in the region , and with already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories .
they were spare parts .
without any future perspective , many young people left the region .
in the area a food factory was created , whose production is not used to supply the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene went back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he started working .
Ne@@ un@@ und@@ forty ligh@@ tens the old soldiers a pension of two thousand p@@ es@@ o per month to spend the years in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
Mr N@@ ene , a man of black skin colour , small , with a few teeth and clear@@ er voice , is not a serious person , yet he for@@ gives the lies that told him not .
they have been lying for ten years .
N@@ ene is 65 years old in R@@ ente , not because it is missing on strength , but because he is bitter .

first Nations youth take advantage Hi@@ p @-@ Hop to express itself and get your own culture

young people of the First Nations communities in Canada are dealing with themes that are important for them . they do they deal with Hi@@ p Hop , thanks to a number of hiking workshops .
as part of the N &apos; we J@@ in@@ an @-@ Tour we offer workshops for schools and youth centres to accommodate youth groups son@@ g@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live recording .
the original workshops were led by the ped@@ agogues of David Hod@@ ges , who lived in Montreal and worked in North @-@ Quebec with ten cre@@ e communities and then with the Cre@@ e Hi@@ p @-@ Hop group The North@@ stars .
the workshop will thus raise that the young participants in our convers@@ ations topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , con@@ front@@ ation , love , self @-@ acceptable , &quot; or whatever has to be found in mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos where young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team worked together with other first Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ n@@ b@@ ago in the US state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the School &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ Y@@ oo in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia tells about the history of highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a street section in West kan@@ ada , where nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women have disappeared or murdered .
the cases were largely un@@ explained .
the next video of the Nem@@ hi Cre@@ e First nation uses the motive of a video game to communicate how important of the receipt of traditional customs and customs of war despite the influences by glob@@ alisation .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , even though the young people do not always rule the tongues of the first Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation will have recorded , the refra@@ in will be sung in Cre@@ e .
the young people involved young people received a little help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly of the North@@ stars Hi@@ p @-@ Hop Group that gives them a drop in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
at the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ site of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an , the St@@ rop@@ he is available , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German :
sometimes I feel when nobody would find me interested in me .
but I continued to go on the earth out of my days
that is the day when you will take our cri@@ i
because we lost our way in life as a youth
but I think we will rise up a day
I don &apos;t want to see how to live a bad life
so they can grow and lead us as well as our youth
so , they can do that , for what it is appointed to the Creator ?
in the commentary part , the reader and the author of Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also adds a contribution and add the St@@ rop@@ he in Sil@@ icon writing ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) :
in Japan , plastic dishes not only be shown in the restaurant
outside of a typical restaurants in Japan ( East Germany ) outside of a typical restaurants .

in Japan you can see almost every restaurant of plastic dishes .
to show potential customers what exactly will be on the menu will be found near the entrance sh@@ oc@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( Cor@@ respon@@ dents , &quot; Plastic models of dishes &quot; ) from each food that is served in this restaurant .
customers see this plastic dishes and decide whether they enter or continue to the restaurant .
there is an entire industry devoted to the production of this plastic dishes .
in the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi district , there is a multitude of these small companies that produce those plastic courts that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders produced in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese these are these plastic dishes so usually that they don &apos;t want to stop them any more . a new trend , however , is transformed into con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous mobile accessories and other g@@ ad@@ gets .
at N@@ aver Mat@@ ina , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i series published by social media links and photographs that show this unusual tw@@ ist with the sh@@ oc@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new with plastic dishes , decorative tapes to be shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u Kauf@@ haus .
many of these artificial foods have been turned into kit@@ shi@@ fts , such as in this case , cooling and mag@@ nets :
here are some Sho@@ oting fridge mag@@ nets for a new exhibition in Tokyo Station .
the new boom of ess@@ ences will increasingly elabor@@ ate increasingly .
in this case , a ka@@ ans @-@ don ( a popular travel bowl has been transformed into a mobile phone stand ) .
for these tri@@ angular dish ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as mobile phone support .
we have also produced this part for the Tokyo exhibition in Tokyo .
and here is an apple that contains your mobile phone :
designed to view like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is a great design .
and that is just the beginning of an increasing flight to the Com@@ ic .
some mobile support and mobile phone designers allow you to produce your own artwork . in this case , ik@@ ura or salmon s@@ est@@ rogen used , a popular T@@ opping , which is served with white rice .
on Twitter , some users had their doub@@ ts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is someone who would say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wow , cool , now I can shave my mobile phone with salmon ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will probably be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also accept a less appet@@ ite form to surprise for example colleagues or family members un@@ pleasant .
our latest mobile phone stand has the form of melting ice .
in addition there are also travel balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and hand bands from dried salmon .
other sk@@ ur@@ r@@ ile plastic dishes can be seen at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s N@@ aver Mat@@ omas blog post . or follow on Twitter to the h@@ ash@@ tag # .
if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trends , this video gives you insight into the district of K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi , which is devoted to the food industry &apos;s food industry . for example , with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .

in reports and foreign media about the inf@@ am@@ ous &quot; struggle against drug tra@@ ff@@ icking in Mexico , the mis@@ si@@ sts and killed regularly only in statistics . this reflected not the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle with itself .
the coverage of drug bos@@ ses like El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the boss of the Sin@@ al@@ oa cartridge , pushed the stories of the victims of conflict entirely in the background .
on the day after a violent incident , someone looks at the fun@@ eral or to the churches they have learned to live with the pain .
behind each bone , behind each bone structure in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wounds can never be cure .
that is why the Mexican news portal of Pol@@ í@@ tico is the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ a a Vi@@ vi@@ r C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( german : &quot; with the drug trade &quot; ) , who will give to this victims to give a voice and stories about people who were in the struggle between the prosecution authorities and cart@@ els .
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project so :
organiz@@ ational crimes can &apos;t be feared by our lives .
the consequences are far pro@@ found .
for example , if business close , because they are threatened by drug tra@@ ders and will therefore have to travel many kilometers for many kilometers to buy something like milk .
the Pain of Vic@@ tims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how fear@@ ing life changed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells you exactly these things . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who sear@@ ches the secret secret graves after his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ guez , who lost their father only one day her father , her husband and her husband , and two of her neph@@ ew .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priest : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday , we prepare ourselves to the task today that we have prepared to get rid of and to the graves after the people whom we have loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric store in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on October 13 he left the house .
on 15th October he was again to be back again , but he never came again . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it is very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need a training .
there is also my mother , which is also here with me .
at the moment she has no income .
all of you are the insurance of my Father , but they won &apos;t pay them out because they require a dying .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where do we get the future ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vi@@ vi@@ r con el nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
we do not only show the faces of those who are afraid of fear . we must show the conflicts of conflicts to show the frag@@ ility and the state of the state .
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some ex@@ cer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ HB , a woman from Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post by Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central texts .
your contribution reminds us that violence should never consider as normal as normal , in which form it occurs :
I &apos;ve been familiar with illness and sens@@ ory journ@@ alism now for a few years .
I pass every day at newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the cover pages with images that actually can come from a textbook for crimin@@ ology or taken from specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I have the feeling as if I am the only one who was hin@@ dered or sad . it acts as a lack of respect to the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be equal to or this as normal .
she writes on :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin remember that he is great . and it is not normal that people listen over the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of offen@@ ders if they go through the streets .
for me , that would be those who have lost someone who lost someone and those who fear for them also something happened .
I see our weakness , if stories are to be naked numbers in a statistics .
the human ess@@ ness of people is incredible for me when death of six people and the dis@@ appearances are justified by 43 students in a neighboring village that they were being moder@@ ately being moder@@ ately . &quot;
I think they &apos;re trying to agree that they are spar@@ ed from such tragedy if they are not silent and quiet@@ ly .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; Four Mon@@ ths Revi@@ val in the capital city : like a family with dr@@ ill@@ ings was sack@@ ed . &quot; in this she describes how armed crime was destroyed for month money from their business , until they were not only destroyed the business but also their family apart .
you think all that you lost , and how many people may change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain never goes up , the sad@@ ness of trau@@ ma , the fear comes again , when you are alone .
hab@@ its have changed , telephone numbers also .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the further we are removed from each other , the better .
she completed her report with the words :
we want to be arrested that the others are arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will lead you or to kill .
I asked myself in these terrible days if you would like to dissolve my deep root feelings , but the answer is no , because I have forgotten how to weep . I have to learn to live with the pain .
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the contribution &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation of violence . &quot;
in the introduction , he puts questions on how to : who car@@ es about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organized crimes ?
how is it to rise in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexican ?
he is not like other young boys of his age , whose parents are of care of them .
Br@@ yan is a father@@ less and he tells himself , how to make an egg cooked , potatoes , tortillas , and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies that lives with him . this is his name for the preparation of fl@@ ac@@ on with water , sugar and dairy powder .
he tells of the nine nar@@ rows on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are un@@ important in comparison to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for the whole life of violence , and who had to learn to live thereby .
when he was five years old , one told him that his mother had disappeared .
but that was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was past two years before , when he was just a few blocks away from his home , the bloody bodies of his father , who had been shot by armed men from a front @-@ driving car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez was seen :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 when violence was mixed by the organized crime and struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murder to public security and government of the United States government .
in 2010 alone , the prosecutor counted 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to average 8.5 Mor@@ den per day .
these are only some of hundreds of thousands of stories that leaves the organized crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country .
only few stories live in view of always new head@@ lines . this project reminds us of those who are not forgotten .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ a a Vi@@ vi@@ r C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose goal is to illustr@@ ate complex information behind the failed struggle against drug tra@@ ff@@ icking , which has crossed the country in the past four decades .
when a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
sharing &quot; Sh@@ aring &apos;s Car@@ ing &quot; from Fli@@ ck@@ r users Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this post and pages , to which he li@@ mp@@ ed , contains images on which violence is represented .
the fact check is important in a moment in which it comes to withdraw a rum@@ or or a f@@ ake .
but how is the years being immersed in social media ? content in social media , whether it is true or true , to continue to exist .
let us take this photo of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of Congo seven years ago .
since its first publication it has been used to adopt the trage@@ dies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false copy of image and event - &quot; wrong description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Draft News - denied not the fact that there is plenty of careful coverage of events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it th@@ rows questions about our desire to messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 a tan@@ ker crossed the place S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ed and explo@@ ded . 230 people were killed .
after the civil war , Africa was second largest country for many years , and thus devast@@ ated thereby . the streets in the region became dangerous paths with impact holes that were difficult to ride .
the tank @-@ wagons fell victim to the victim .
as a representative of a fire , the dozens of houses are described , including a cinem@@ as close by , which was full of people , illustr@@ ate the soccer world championships .
spread the houses and bub@@ bles were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to in@@ sol@@ u@@ bility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Das is Nigeria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur users Myst@@ ic Monkey , 12 . January 201@@ 5.@@ All photos of the incident make the gray scenes this day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
above is an example .
it shows rows of carbon@@ ized body , which are b@@ lown up on the ground during persons .
but here the story finds no end here .
more than the years , the same photo was wi@@ ped on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms , but certainly not attributed to the related tragedy , in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what and what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 the com@@ bat@@ ants of the B@@ oko Har@@ am inv@@ aded the village of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
ey@@ e@@ witnesses reported dra@@ stically of atro@@ cities before whom they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies were burned in streets and bus@@ hes .
there were reports of which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ red .
but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; no one remained back to count course , &quot; said a resident on Human Rights Watch .
many were z@@ oned , shot or burned .
only from satellite images the following time could be illustrated .
the reason for the attack was also un@@ explained , but the armies in Bagh@@ a had been a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt to win the B@@ oko Har@@ am , country ( examples from the year 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the image taken from the DR Congo again , as proof of the fact , as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this ab@@ usive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of patches with flaws ; Africa check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the picture was taken as a cover for mass mo@@ ckers .
another step further provide personal comments such as this example from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to provide arguments .
the picture from S@@ ange also occurred in conjunction with the dead@@ ly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar in Myanmar .
according to a flash of lightning , published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee ra@@ pes , rape and some dead , some by burning .
while others reported on violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Post@@ s appeared as the following that these descriptions were gathered with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from an Saudi @-@ Arab news page , which led to 2012 , the President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ ein said that mon@@ ks and politicians had involved in the assassination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to resol@@ ve this information .
the original contribution , which was accessed on April 26 , 2017 , can be accessed here .
other News organisations , the AF@@ P as their source as their source , had also attributed to this statement , but had not thus brought the image from the DR Congo in connection .
the worldwide operating range of false information
traces of this wrong c@@ is@@ itions submit themselves to the years 2011 and 2012 and come back everywhere in all over the world .
using a &quot; inver@@ ted photo search , &quot; you can see how far the borders can be exceeded .
a converted picture @-@ search with the search engine of Tin@@ Eye has found 344 pictures of 344 at 18.@@ 8 billion images ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) , which are very similar to that of the DR Congo .
they come from a mixed mas@@ ch of private sites , platforms of social media and community , as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have passed false reports , others have tried to un@@ m@@ ise the f@@ eit@@ ed for@@ f@@ ings .
we used examples for the dis@@ sem@@ inary use and associated with the respective countries in connection , based on which page it had been published . thus , we want to illustr@@ ate the range than through language alone .
several examples of impro@@ per use may be used from the listed countries ( which are related to each other in some cases ) .
here some cases that can now be split completely up ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News Fr@@ ames .
country examples of false copy of the image from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange @-@ related countries are based on pages or server using the examples of counter@@ f@@ ences or fal@@ cons are still available .
the countries in gray are examples that are available according to the met@@ ad@@ ata and information that are available via Tin@@ Eye , probably also counter@@ f@@ eit examples .
as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the picture from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to an al@@ ign and interested Arab@@ s ) as part of a thread to the &quot; War of Buddh@@ ist rebellion against Muslims . &quot;

T@@ wit@@ ter@@ work after the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am like this here , which used the picture from the DR Congo to illustr@@ ate the &quot; atro@@ cities committed by Islam , have clearly seen no pages like Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster , who contra@@ di@@ ct this .

Myanmar , 2017 .
the government of Myanmar published a correc@@ ting position what they were considered &quot; inten@@ tionally fing@@ ering news and photos , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments in an attempt to create mis@@ understanding in regards to Myanmar . &quot;
this correc@@ ting that has been published only in English also includes references to f@@ ake images of rum@@ ours that are used by the H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and are used by extrem@@ ist groups to create that Muslims Budd@@ hist@@ s kill and elsewhere ( which is widely used by Bur@@ m@@ ese national@@ ists ) .

this post , who addressed to the members of the Russian Orthodox church , indicates that the image of the DR @-@ Democratic Republic is NOT Muslims who kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ an died in 2012 that mon@@ ks and politicians had been involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims , and brought the story together with the picture from S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication is the picture still contained in it .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 on students who have been killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the cath@@ olic close message An@@ á@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has expressly explained that the picture is not taken by the red@@ ress , but it claims it a &quot; similar @-@ layer assault . &quot;
when the picture was later in circulation with the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am of 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to contra@@ di@@ ct that it would be connection to Nigeria .

the picture of the DR Congo appeared , fitted with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and replaced a discussion under Muslims under the B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the stop on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve that their communities found these events that took place in the name of Islamic State , a major attention .
United States , 2015 .
the picture was tor@@ tured as a letter to the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times save ) , but the messages that were linked to them were taken in no religious context .
instead it was the goal of teaching attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of the media reports in comparison of Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( ese ) , 2014 .
after a message that was supp@@ os@@ edly written by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mart@@ os &quot; on the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , in circulation , there were discussion for@@ ums as this here in Vietnamese and explained it to the issue of issue .
from the message which contains the image from the DR Congo , the organization of the Clark Mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mart@@ os was dist@@ anced .
there are further confirmed examples of a def@@ ective use of the picture from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
on other accounts , generators and sites in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) shows Tin@@ Eye also , but are no longer fully tra@@ ce@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with UR@@ Ls and time / date stamp , they exist on the Web@@ cra@@ wler , and have some image file names associated with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which only appeared clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the image may finally leave a correct description but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong issues or frames ( ir@@ radiation ) that attract these posters . the first frame is focused on religion .
the photo was used in terms of greater discussions about silence in relation to the h@@ ort@@ ation of Christians by Muslims or - to the defense of Muslims - the victims of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as through Budd@@ hist@@ s .
a second Fr@@ aming uses the picture to discuss how an African life is assessed as opposed to a European or French life .
religion understanding and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worthwhile to examine how pictures can be used in connection with these efforts .
a lower question is however , what happens if readers can &apos;t give these images no longer faith .
with social media , there are nin@@ ety people who have un@@ inten@@ tionally , the water around a tragedy .
sug@@ ger@@ ated this mood of mal@@ nour@@ ish and false information that actual atro@@ cities are invisible and decorate the real hor@@ ror of what is actually done in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the spread of for@@ ci@@ ble images was already made in detail ( for example ) .
a argument is that the re@@ tention is equivalent to images of a ref@@ us@@ al to recogn@@ ise the tragedy . sometimes these pictures are even demanded by the victims themselves .
at the same time , concern that for@@ ci@@ ble images readers and viewers des@@ iring to feel the ability to emp@@ ath@@ y emp@@ ath@@ y ( such as this study , who sought to act as for@@ ci@@ ble media to help others ) .
while there is a lot regarding for@@ ci@@ ble represent@@ ations in the media media , fact , it is fact that they are indisp@@ ens@@ able for the current news report .
techn@@ ologists experim@@ enting with algorith@@ ms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; . you will thoroughly have to think about the situation in which a picture is suggested , but also replaced by the context or completely un@@ break@@ able way .
any examination of a false sub@@ sid@@ y should also be taken into account as internationally as they can .

a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. un@@ mist@@ ak@@ able ) ende@@ av@@ our to offer voice enthusiastic a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not to transl@@ ate .
such words are in any language : you press certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these indisp@@ ens@@ able words are already well @-@ known ( like the famous Portuguese aci@@ da@@ de ) and others that were deeply ro@@ oted in a special culture ( for example , Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) .
but all resist persistent every attempt of a simple translation .
a word or expression is not enough , why a complete explanation and sometimes somewhat context is necessary to understand exactly what is meant with this one word .
these unique words have been collected for a full time in an online list .
most of these lists deal with Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
in the blog you can find words in the V@@ anu@@ at@@ u V@@ anu@@ at@@ u V@@ anu@@ at@@ u V@@ anu@@ at@@ u , as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Bem@@ est yourself to your parents in recognition , as ende@@ avo@@ red for yourself in your younger years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and words in the H@@ uns@@ ell@@ ry language spoken in parts of Brazil , as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kw@@ adi &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - The convenience or sl@@ oth that you feel in cold days in the sun . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words in his blog About :
they create other cultures , un@@ cover other ideas and cur@@ ios@@ ity our cur@@ ios@@ ity .
sometimes , influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this site to publish and show more of this &quot; un@@ translated &quot; words and show how diverse , valuable , and impressive these small languages .

how Sri Lanka surro@@ unds the worst disaster in the decade
the island of Sri Lanka is now facing the worst high water and land@@ slide cat@@ astrophe in this decade .
triggered by the Mon@@ sun , who normally places the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ sson , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tri@@ ag@@ alu O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country on the shore .
after an opinion of the cat@@ astroph@@ ic city of Sri Lanka , 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly hundreds of people are missing because of the floods and can@@ opy .
since the last Friday ( 26 May ) , more than 400 000 people have been affected and about 100 000 people were killed in 304 safe areas .
the rain falls on Saturday ( May 27 ) after , and the water flows in some areas went slowly .
health and hygiene subjects of the population constitute a massive challenge in the affected areas and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following images and videos have an impression of the magnitude of the Fl@@ ut@@ cat@@ astrophe :
flood water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water levels of up to 7,5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am ants and Sri Lanka are supplying regular updates to high water situation .

the Women &apos;s March on January 21 , 2017 in San Francisco .
photo of Sah@@ ar Hab@@ ib G@@ ha@@ zi .
using permission : Dam@@ as in January I participated in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and love friend .
I trust in her four years old daughter , who tru@@ sts to me her children , she is my rock in the fire .
in one minute we are still calling Par@@ ols for the rights of women .
in the next moment we en@@ code rights for trans@@ missions .
we are located in a sea of rain umbre@@ l@@ las and people , some hold the ic@@ onic picture of a woman with head@@ scarf high , bound out of an American flag , others sk@@ inn@@ ed par@@ ols against Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia .
my gir@@ l@@ friend looks upon me and says : &quot; these things do not affect you , or ? &quot; why , because I am not Mus@@ lim@@ a ? &quot; I will ask .
I have already run these entertainment .
people , with whom I have been working or people who know me since years , split me - the Sah@@ ar , which they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built up in their not@@ ebook .
they de@@ compos@@ e me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all alike .
we practic@@ ing our religion differently .
we identify us to be a Muslim , on different art . but somehow we are mixed all in the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is well constructed in our collective performance , that as soon as Muslims , which do not fit there , have been mus@@ li@@ fied .
to be mus@@ li@@ fied
I &apos;m not alone .
this even happened to the poet , whose poetry is sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what images are given in the sense when you consider to him ?
love ?
peace ?
when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was so old , he was a Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Kor@@ an and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the center of his poetry .
but in the Western presentation , Religion Rum@@ is was deleted , as well as from the most popular translations of poetry .
this del@@ eting makes a great part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another exists in the induc@@ tive pictures of Muslims , the western books have been colon@@ ized since centuries .
this temp@@ ting image language is determined by the dark men that you should fear and the exotic woman who should be saved .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian scientist Edward S@@ aid completed the history behind these pictures in the 1970s .
but these pictures also stands out today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood they continue to help .
I worked for three years in the news industry and I &apos;ve seen how this powerful , bad Nar@@ rati@@ ves domin@@ ate our news@@ feeds .
this Nar@@ rati@@ v over@@ sh@@ adows the reality that led to their country during the last three decades , while the United States in 2016 could not even choose their first female presidential candidate .
this Nar@@ rati@@ v failed to recogn@@ ise that if French , Muslim women are prevented , their head cloth in public buildings are forced to cover their whole body to cover their entire body , which are both of the same coin .
a mighty group ex@@ ts its &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; other . &quot;
this strong Nar@@ rati@@ v weak@@ ens Muslim women to conduct mot@@ ions for change .
it also sees that the first Muslim prayers were spoken in American soil by Afri@@ kan@@ ers , who had been brought to slave ships in this way .
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er Muslims .
this Nar@@ rati@@ v has occupied our collective pre@@ ference force in deep and def@@ ective , that often S@@ ik@@ h men and children become the goal of tim@@ ic@@ onic attacks and ch@@ ic@@ ans .
because of these stories we tell us and because of the kind where we tell them , islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; other . &quot;
belong to the 1,7 billion
in the news industry we can do more than just stories that are based on facts .
or to alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ rative who help us understand the world .
and my industry is contrac@@ tually failed to capture the Nar@@ rati@@ v of 1,7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we are failed here , where seven million Muslims comprise the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one @-@ third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ Americans .
six of ten American Muslims belong to the immig@@ rants of the first generation that come from 77 countries .
the parents of the author was 1976 in New York .
use approved .
four decades ago my native parents came to New York to live a dream .
my mother put her first jew@@ ellery design in 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ per was made by the Muslim , American styles from Bangladesh , with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
then , when Khan was re @-@ thought the Sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were overcome by Muslims and Americans .
but am I now op@@ ted Mus@@ lim@@ a and an American ?
sometimes , when people ask , why I have no pi@@ g meat , I say - instead of my Muslim recipes or bring my hand@@ ful T@@ ash@@ ore that contribute to all Muslims with themselves - &quot; from respect to pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I kid@@ ding , we wear not all T@@ ash@@ enk@@ or@@ ane with us .
we also have to be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or almost always be selected for additional security checks at the airport .
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim schol@@ ars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists , which ende@@ av@@ oured to fight far beyond Islam .
these lies are produced on the current volume of a well @-@ lubric@@ ated Islam@@ ist machinery with banknotes , think tanks and experts for fal@@ seh@@ ood , which has already been a Muslim , or of what is Islam , manip@@ ulated .
because of the stories that we tell , and because of the species , in which we tell them , Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia suffered more than just a stranger that prov@@ okes the head cloth .
or as the sc@@ ary map of attacks on mos@@ ques in the whole USA , see below .

Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia in its ug@@ ly forms mat@@ ures our affili@@ ation .
it takes up our identity that is so far so versatile , so versatile and complex that it can be impossible to fit in a drawer .
the author in 1986 on a photo of their nur@@ ser@@ y group .
use approved .
I want to explain that .
I was born as Mus@@ lim@@ a , but a Muslim was born only in my pre@@ ference , when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a Pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian Church in New York .
if social schol@@ ar describe religious life , they run on the following terms : believ@@ ing , behavior and affili@@ ation .
my Muslim faith and behavior are perhaps not visible , but they are there .
perhaps my gir@@ l@@ friend , my neigh@@ bor , my rock in the fire , that I am Mus@@ lim@@ a when they split up through the 15 meters of concrete and air to separate our houses .
she would see the gener@@ al@@ ous rit@@ ual with my daughter , when I kept them in my arms and her Arab verses to protect it and be called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
for each of them I repeat three times .
I pray you , that they are protected from evil , the evil one that can see and see the evil man that can &apos;t see .
my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow .
the grand@@ mother of the author , when she wins an icon competition in Kar@@ achi , with their sisters sometime in the 1960s .
use approved .
belonging to my grand@@ mother &apos;s grand@@ mother is the image of my grand@@ mother , with her sisters ; as they win a competition of art of flowers in Kar@@ achi in decades .
it is the picture of you that I can see in this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by their completed and un@@ finished paintings by an old Su@@ fi @-@ healing ; and a cor@@ an with a lot of book@@ marks , a book with a hundreds of fourteen chapters , which can be virtually ag@@ ile .
Mus@@ a to be his means to speak the prayers which they had said to me when I have a bad day .
Mus@@ a to be in it , as she has contributed to me to refer to God , Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord .
for a people , that - over centuries - through a &quot; empire , &quot; which was founded a company with the name hon@@ est British eastern ini@@ dien @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , has its deep significance to call on my single Lord .
the author 1987 with their grandfather .
use approved .
affili@@ ation means to grow and hear that men are not weeping , but at the same time to see that my grandfather was weeping .
during his books he writes about the modern Islam and on the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir@@ s , N@@ ana J@@ aan is surrounded by his family in India , the family that he did not close to his arms in half a century .
affili@@ ation is to know that there are millions Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , whose families were torn apart from col@@ oni@@ alists , who have dealt the Muslim world as at the game .
Mus@@ a to be his means to know that in the last two centuries , Europeans have united all to four Muslim countries . &quot;
it means to know that the first pilot of the history was dropped by a Muslim country in front of a century .
it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my Grand@@ mother , an in@@ ly , Geor@@ gian sub@@ jection of the British Empire , described as &quot; dangerous &quot; in his time , as he led the first mosque in England .
even before the aircraft , he traveled to more parts of the world as I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .
the Word of Islam .

to my Muslim tribe of 1,7 billion people , our unforgettable family trees are back , our in@@ con@@ clusive history .
it means to recall that fourteen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops that were across every continent apart from Antar@@ c@@ tica , spread to Iraq , to pursue mass destruction weapons that didn &apos;t exist .
it means that more than half a million Iraq @-@ Ira@@ q@@ is buried under the ruins of the war .
an American Mus@@ lim@@ a means to know that the self @-@ mor@@ dr@@ ate in veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 per cent since 2001 .
it means to know that if a tragedy is hidden for the US and to susp@@ ects a Muslim name , the story four times more reported as a story with a white attack .
it means to know that four hundred years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , from a liberated black slaves , named Bil@@ al .
it means to know that two hundred years ago , an African Islam@@ ist named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was reconc@@ iled and brought into this country .
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X to name a American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people filled the airports in order to fight against the Muslim B@@ an .
it is the hope that I feel when we rise for our dreams , and when we say black lives .
an American woman , a p@@ ah@@ ari , a p@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Pun@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist , signi@@ fies the in@@ firm@@ ities of our identity , but to fail , they communicate to others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Nar@@ rati@@ v of the 1,7 billion has more possibilities than a mag@@ ician , but will be represented in the reduced branches &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one mother to be one mother means to help me to make my child , and all Muslim children , knowing that power@@ full and privileged individuals will establish on this branch of structural Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia .
structural Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia exists in the Muslim regi@@ sters which began with President Bush and have been expanded under President Obama .
it consists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it is in the immig@@ rant officials , who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in handic@@ raft .
it is in a country which covers its borders across people from just across the countries that bom@@ bed it .
it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ fly list , &quot; which takes largely Arab@@ s and Muslims .
there are the wars we lead and the bombs we cast out on Muslim lands .
because of the stories we tell , and because of them which we do not tell us we are here today .
in a study entitled Asc@@ ent of Man , scientists showing the North@@ western University participants a scientific image and requested them to assess groups on a scale of 1 to 100 as regards evolution .
Muslims received the least score .
the conversation we must lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deeply dar@@ ed to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are back for decades to recogn@@ ise the roots of our fears and the def@@ ective and dangerous images that we store in our news editorial offices .
at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry that tries to capture our multiple ident@@ ities and forgotten history .
the Pod@@ cast lake Som@@ e@@ thing , Say Som@@ e@@ thing by Bu@@ zz@@ ling ; the Pod@@ cast # Good@@ Mus@@ a Muslim ; Sap@@ el@@ o Square on black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Sch@@ ust@@ ers Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to multiply Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the Pak@@ ist@@ ani , Muslim , American super@@ hero - all this makes me hope .
screen@@ shots of media initiatives that want to show the complexity and inter@@ sec@@ tional@@ ity of American life .
coll@@ age of author .
but I &apos;m concerned about this difficult global point in which we are located .
and that moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is a reason that conspi@@ racy the@@ or@@ ists exist in the dark corners of the Internet , now lead the White House .
they have grown explicitly because they have made Muslims to &quot; other . &quot;
there is another group that has been exposed to exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other &quot; .
a few years ago it had not been given her ; now they have dominion large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I &apos;m concerned about the re@@ alities and history , which I was not aware of when I was so old , as it is now my daughter , but those who have made me to an un@@ found Mus@@ lim@@ a .
things I left here like a baking rack in my speech .
things that may wake up memories , because in all the inter@@ actions that makes our mankind a story , where someone is made to another &quot; other . &quot;
just now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley you will find conversation within the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia .
more than 100 academ@@ ics speak about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; structural R@@ ass@@ ism &quot; and &quot; American mil@@ itar@@ ism . &quot;
these are no terms , with whom we usually throw in our schools to us or who we read in our newspapers .
poster of the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ side of the Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia Studies network .
we all need to ask ourselves why ?
why do I count this here at this T@@ ED@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford where Edward S@@ aid , the man who has shown us how wars are led and people through creating the &quot; other &quot; in public performance , four decades ago as a scientist of Stan@@ ford was .
we have to introduce ourselves un@@ comfortable questions according to the role of what my gir@@ l@@ friend and I like living in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the occupation that we have no president , who bom@@ bed the chocolate countries and &quot; to others , &quot; goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for nar@@ rative Art wants to preserve urban diversity
announ@@ cements , from Fli@@ ck@@ r users Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 license .
can it be possible to enter , here and now in connection with someone in connection ?
for Steven Bird and Ro@@ by@@ n Perry , founder of the treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) , it is the number of stories in their original language a possible response .
global Vo@@ ices reported a brief initiative of Steven Bird , the Un@@ re@@ plac@@ eable blog .
however , the focus of T@@ LS is not written in written but on the spoken word . it is a try to obtain the language variety of major cities and to kill .
indeed , in urban areas , like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia , or Oak@@ land in the United States where T@@ LS has already carried out events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite small languages are not given to the children born there .
for the makers of the project , :
the mass mortality of the world &apos;s languages can be avoided if we take cities to accept diversity - safe spaces that are not forgotten in which inhabitants are to be attributed to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; during &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; often they are often associated to understand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are these events instead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listen to feel to feel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ yt@@ eller presents their history at first in their own language , or transl@@ ating or explain it in English .
even if the participants are no professional stor@@ yt@@ eller , their dedication and their representation is that the audience can rely on it .
they call mer@@ ry and emotions , as the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional story of Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the story of R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou is also the opportunity to discuss the country &apos;s typical customs of customs .
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the f@@ ak from the bun@@ ni@@ es and the P@@ avian in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
after he declared the importance of his f@@ abel , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is this to speak to an audience , that will not understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in@@ eness he shares his feeling of in@@ sof@@ ter :
you have heard !
they were atten@@ tive ...
they were very with me !
so far , the events of Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling took place in three cities , and the organizers hope to expand this . all who are inspired by the project can organise your own story in contact with T@@ LS .
Puerto Rico calls for the United States New fest@@ ation of the State School
with the aim of a new testing of public debt of Puerto Rico , which amount to 72 million US dollars , took part in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017 . the march started at the pu@@ er@@ tor@@ ic@@ ol Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and ran to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
she was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano P@@ or la Au@@ dit@@ ory ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( civil war for the ne@@ ural testing of the debts ) and the Ö@@ kom@@ en@@ ical Assembly in Puerto Ric@@ os .
the Inter@@ c@@ ession of the debts of the debts have also submitted a petition to the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is your requirement :
the people of Puerto R@@ os requires that the politicians , banks and government authorities are responsible for their corruption to responsibility for their corruption .
we request a financial examination and a tap Committee without personal interests in public debts , with a firm , our working conditions corresponding compensation , which is ag@@ ated in favour of the economy .
we are pressed and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto Ric@@ os ref@@ uses to pay a debt that is not its .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pension@@ ers will not be deduc@@ ted with sin@@ c@@ ing retirement deposits .
we require instant measures .
the island - not in the territory of state @-@ owned territory of the United States - suffer from a serious financial crisis .
hence , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; an independent non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with focus on soci@@ o@@ economic development , a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to existing state recognition .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ric@@ os requires a wide restructuring of state infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; measures resulting from the outside , without the participation and convic@@ tion of the citizens , are exp@@ elled from the people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the demonstration bore the name &quot; Night@@ watch for Light and Truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :

the sy@@ ri@@ cally Palestinian web developer Bas@@ le Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bas@@ le Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over one year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and members of the campaign will continue to recall the contributions that he made an open net .
at this year &apos;s re : PU@@ BL@@ ICA , the annual conference of digital culture , which will be held annually in Berlin , dedicated a event of the # Free@@ Bas@@ le campaign .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the French @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , Managing Director of Book Spr@@ ints &apos; finished books within three to five days , l@@ ases Ex@@ trac@@ ts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Colle@@ ctive In@@ ser ( The Cost of Freedom : a collective after@@ research ) .
the book , published in the last year , and here is licensed freely , contains a number of essays that deal with free culture in the presence of repression .
it is an homage to Bas@@ le and his work .
in the introduction it is :
this book would like to create how movements for free knowledge are built and what the true costs are linked with which this is associated .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors , who are involved in movements for free knowledge , side worked on site to look over the fog that surro@@ unds our news@@ feeds and create something in our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bas@@ le Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunte@@ er , which has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012 .
his name was kn@@ itted from the directory of the A@@ dra prison in which he sat on October 3 , 2015 .
since then we have no information about his present state or location .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice which want to release on his release , and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom .
to see how Bas@@ sel has paid a high price for his participation in a free culture , has many of us start thinking about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , actions and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what do we have op@@ ted for ?
what have we abandoned in this process of tim@@ est@@ ly extreme belie@@ fs ?
since March 2012 , the Web developers for Open Source and digital activ@@ ist has been in detention of Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bas@@ sel was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution which was transferred to an unknown destination .
his wife , the writer and lawyer in N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; Military Police Bas@@ sel had taken on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; commissioned by his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported that she had been contacted by individuals on November 12 , 2015 , who presented themselves as the Insider @-@ government to put themselves in knowledge of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
his dwelling place and condition remains unknown .
a pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects like Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel played a crucial role in the Internet and knowledge to the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist , and currently super@@ bly the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project which founded Bas@@ le , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bass@@ els cultural prototypes were predic@@ tive than the work that he started to re@@ constru@@ ct the ancient ruins Pal@@ m@@ yr@@ as in 2005 in order to re@@ constru@@ ct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ m@@ yr@@ as .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important arch@@ e@@ ological sites in the world , was the way@@ mark of numerous civilian populations and here the gre@@ ek @-@ Roman architectural types of hi@@ ther@@ to traditions and Persian influences .
Bas@@ le was able to know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would be all about that architecture that is not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this passage into the digital arch@@ e@@ ology and the conservation has created a time capsule which will be presented to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future of un@@ estimated value .
Bas@@ le could not yet close this project until now .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband , his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I spent my whole life that dre@@ aming of freedom and Bash@@ sel taught me to emb@@ race her arms .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bas@@ le brought English to me , even when he was already in jail .
I learned to read and speak English well .
he always has his knowledge with everyone who has asked . he has taught others to read and speak English .
Bas@@ le opened my door to the technology , and he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he also had other in@@ car@@ es , as they use computer , at least theore@@ tically , without that they had actually held one in their hands .
G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Warten ) , a sab@@ re that she wrote in prison in the years 2012 to 2015 , when he was in jail .
Bas@@ sel and N@@ our@@ a have worked together in the book together for a year .
she sailed the lyrics by him when they visited him , and translated them out of the Arab to English .

it happens during each visit ,
that I sin@@ ter in the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose the improvement in the moment in which we emb@@ race us ,
that any of the d@@ angers doesn &apos;t matter .
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ackl@@ es and gu@@ ardi@@ ans
I forget the sc@@ ur@@ ge of the prison
and I dr@@ s in every detail of your voice and words
I carry my passion for me ,
if your eyes say f@@ arewell
and I leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I turn back to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to get to it all the moments ,
and over your absence to cry and smile .
I bear witness that I will return soon ...

Bass@@ el &apos;s story is not unique in Syria .
according to the protests against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Ass@@ ets , the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) have disappeared for more than 65@@ ,000 people .
those who were arrested or executed under violence through the regime were tor@@ tured or executed .
by 2016 , according to international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International have died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians in jail since 2011 .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community calls for the release of Bas@@ le since 2012 .
we repeat today our demand in hope that we have to do for the last time .
Moz@@ ambi@@ que : due to corruption in the case of corruption , he was again fore@@ se@@ per@@ ed to the post office .
Moz@@ ambi@@ ki re@@ acted to a corruption in which a government member returned to the workplace after half of his sentence to the workplace in which the corruption has been committed .
this is the Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison in 2010 together with four other def@@ endants for violation of 54 million Met@@ ik@@ al .
the money came from public funds of the airports of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , the Council of Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately asked his re@@ inst@@ ant@@ ments to the company , which happened on April 19 , then too .
in accordance with an opinion of the General At@@ tor@@ ney of the Republic , which granted the application , there was no obst@@ acle for Cam@@ b@@ aza , to refer to his old post , as the company was no discipline proceedings after his imprisonment .
but many inhabitants are not good .
the centre for public integrity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , shortly C@@ IP ) , a local institution which places for public transparency , condemned in an interview with the Deutsche Welle , the decision of the company to re@@ locate the director :
represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and illustrates the lack of transparency and is even a step in terms of the efforts of our legal systems , the C@@ IP .
what we have noted that also the company should have a discipline procedure against the ir@@ resist@@ ible option .
however , the company was silent , but not appropriate legal steps for the application of appropriate functions .
Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Mos@@ ambi@@ que social media , re@@ jects this behavior as well as &quot; resist@@ ible &quot; :
if Cam@@ b@@ aza would be a competent body , he would have been a consultant after he was sentenced to prison and half of them .
he could only hold lectures and motiv@@ ating speech , he could advise and polishing his image .
but as he is competent , he has approved to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped to harm .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza is glad@@ ly paid for his silence .
resist@@ ors !
bitter@@ ness Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ ambi@@ que and Student of Political Science in Brazil , says the director no Mor@@ al :
cam@@ b@@ aza was rewarded by the state because he couldn &apos;t believe that someone has rewarded someone to such a way that has already been severely damaged the state .
Cam@@ b@@ aza is missing the mor@@ als to return and serve to the state , * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead , only himself is served on the state .
Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state , as this man had turned out to be an in@@ exhau@@ st@@ ive money source and the state itself was we@@ ary of this man , who was up@@ loaded and convicted to a long prison sentence .
hon@@ est@@ ly , I don &apos;t know why this man was rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te preferred to remember the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remember that a thief was put in prison :
th@@ iev@@ es belong to the prison of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el will not only remain as the first independent president in memory , but also as a sharp , cutting and - by the proph@@ etic speakers .
one of his most famous oral represent@@ ations , when he became more energet@@ ically confirmed that &quot; an ambitious man is too strong , even the pat@@ ern@@ ity for his amb@@ itions , his own individual interest , for sale . &quot;
Sam@@ ora said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if a ambitious man changes , my experience shows that this is not the case . he changes the tac@@ tics , but he doesn &apos;t turn from his amb@@ itions .
an ambitious man is criminal criminal . &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also le@@ aning :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he was 10 years old and came free .
and today , the company , with which he is the money rep@@ ented , again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ v@@ ai@@ kov@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - Test@@ i@@ bly . ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) , May 12 , 2017

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cen@@ sored many users to wrong
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means K@@ ich@@ er@@ erb@@ se or sp@@ elling .

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network adopted its Post@@ s from the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; abst@@ ained .
although more than the origin of the word is still being discussed , it is usually used to refer to people East Indian origin , or generally used as ad@@ j@@ ec@@ tively &quot; In@@ deed &quot; .
Facebook is licensed to the word &quot; Kal@@ ar , &quot; ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese Scripture ) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of Hass@@ elt in Burma in the social network .
in recent years , the rise of radical national@@ ist movements has been given an extremely dis@@ appearance K@@ onn@@ ot@@ ation .
in particular , it is a word , most commonly used by Ultra national@@ ists as an Hass@@ elt against Muslims , which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in the effort to combat Hass@@ elt in Myanmar , the company has a lot of sen@@ su@@ al contents on his platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; can usually be brought together with rac@@ ism in connection , but the word at itself calls not automatically in Hass@@ elt .
the context is important , # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that they also discussed the use of the Word , in which they have reviewed the use of the Word , or to doubt .
in addition , there are several bur@@ ial words with basic mean@@ ings which have the same accounting sequence like &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese &apos;s &apos; Kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; which contains the same letter as well as other words such as &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( Sp@@ age ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( curtain ) , or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ kn@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the various mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post of my friends was deleted today , because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however he asked his friends to be wonder@@ ing whether they knew how he could alle@@ vi@@ ate his back pain , making it a word game .
the sentence K@@ u la - &quot; Cure &quot; ( K@@ u ) + the Quest@@ ion@@ word ( la ) to Bur@@ m@@ ese - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different .
there were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ eth is the opinion that she must decrease in Hass@@ elt &apos;s radical national@@ ists , but also emphas@@ ized that Facebook must be analytical before it all the posters that are suspected in suspected of dis@@ sem@@ inate rac@@ ism .
Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it &apos;s made the word automatically .
the automation will not understand what you are writing on Facebook .
what should make it instead , check the post carefully and control it by checking the following words .
for example &quot; Kal@@ ar Ht@@ ine &quot; ( Chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( Sp@@ age ) .
the good thing is that these three national@@ ists are spreading in Hass@@ elt , a pretty good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise its National@@ ism .
while the action takes a strong signal to all , the language of Hass@@ elt , may not keep the efficiency of this strategy long .
the experiences of social networks in China like S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of tags often have a cat and mouse game , whereby the users social networks will simply start to use a new word or an alternative writing of cen@@ sored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to delete his post when he wanted to tell his friends , that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is banned by the social network :
... when I was atten@@ tive to this new directive on Facebook , I made a post to announce my Facebook friends that the Word is closed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Iron@@ ically , my post office has been removed from Facebook and has been the li@@ ken , post and share of contents for 24 hours , because the post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook community &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was not ent@@ ail &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Facebook has a variety of postcards from people that have no negative inten@@ tions , or just try to show their opinions against the Hass@@ elt radical national@@ ists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed nothing to do with hate speech :
post without Hass@@ elt from Facebook .
in the Post , the author divided his opinion about why extreme national@@ ism and religious foundations are bad in the country .
Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have been doing more than the beginning of the initiative , for example , the Bur@@ m@@ ese internet Community to ask advice :
Facebook is like a well @-@ wanted intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma by their platform , but it does not work .
such words are to be cen@@ sored only more hat@@ red within the different communities .
it also seems to be as if they start without local context or technical support , and such words as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; pe@@ a curr@@ y &quot; have been forbidden .
even when they found that they have made mist@@ akes , they did not temp@@ ting the deleted postal codes .
if they had just something more respect for the 15 million benefit that would have a great revenues would have been great .
Fac@@ eb@@ ooks L@@ ens@@ or@@ ship has made a lot of sc@@ aff@@ old among the users .
instead of serious , users are now fun and write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of Hass@@ elt to see if your mail will be taken from the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook Post@@ s , which contained no hate , but nevertheless removed :
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair sitting and watch the pe@@ an@@ curr@@ y and watch a Indian movie .
just to try out whether Facebook contains the mail , which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; the post says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screenshot , used with permission .
over the last five years , extreme national@@ istic ide@@ ologies and religious foundations have been used to expand social networks in order to expand their voices and their influence .
among other things , Hass@@ elt is alleged to heat violence in social networks in the congregations in Myanmar , especially in the Rak@@ h@@ ine territory , where disp@@ utes between Muslims and Budd@@ hist@@ s were forced to escape .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised for his announ@@ cing the bal@@ dness of Hass@@ elt to his bur@@ ial pages under control .
but rather than simply pressed the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have had better ongoing efforts to settle initiatives in the context of concentr@@ ating initiatives and learned of them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is the end with the children &apos;s before
a wedding ring in the sand .

the children &apos;s before is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on June 9 , 2017 , Parliament of the country unanimously decided to adopt a law which is to offer this practice so that the marriage @-@ ready age is now at 18 .
prior to this change of the marriage , some members were controlled , and in May 2016 there came to a large public proc@@ ession . at that time , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mah@@ ar@@ aj , the leader of the various religious groups of the country was gathered that the state should not be in@@ fer@@ ior to the country that the age would not have the maturity . &quot;
this occurred un@@ respec@@ ting the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contrac@@ ting partner of the UN Child Human Rights , the min@@ ors of children under 18 years of age . &quot;
the UN &apos;s statistics for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who were with 15 were married , in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago 2.8 percent , and at 18 it was 8.1 percent .
in 2011 the Federal Office of the country confirmed that between 1997 and 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 .
online pet@@ itions and social media movements , strug@@ gles to abol@@ ish laws to children , followed on the feet and rejoiced with great support . und@@ ou@@ bt@@ edly , they helped them to bring this outcome .
but did not work correctly .
a Hin@@ du @-@ Guide , for example , had no concerns to say the critics of the children &apos;s childhood , they should be dam@@ ned to worry about their own affairs . &quot;
this species religious opposition sor@@ row@@ ed for ten@@ sions in this actually un@@ complicated matter , and some doub@@ ts came to whether the opposition would agree to the law of the bill .
however , at the beginning of 2017 , the bill against the Child was decided - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( among them one woman ) of the opposition and an independent who abst@@ ained - so that he could be deb@@ ated in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make it a law .
now only the president of the country has to vote and declare the law .
one of the country &apos;s Sen@@ ators released a status update , which read Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle at Inst@@ ag@@ ram :
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence R@@ amb@@ har@@ at : the bill against the Children &apos;s Day was signed in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes for this and no single one .
after being decided in the Senate , the draft version can now be made to the law .
the majority of the social media user was thr@@ illed because the laws have been changed before finally .
Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who is a Minister of Ministers in the Ministry of Education , said :
it has too much time and unnecessary Ger@@ ede , which has veil@@ ed the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the children &apos;s before is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that is almost every prize .
while Abel was the opinion , it was definitely long enough to abol@@ ish the practice was L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas that the day was finally come :
public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , , Excellent News !
the sp@@ ouse was decided .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 therefore - 0 against it ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ lowing Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( W@@ I@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society that is right open on it , how important the adoption of the law is , noted :
the married age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the draft for the amendment of the marriage was adopted today , on 9 June 2017 .
the House of Represent@@ atives there are 41 members and 35 of them were present at the vote .
all members who were added to the law have approved for the law .
the children &apos;s before is not permitted in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ min@@ age@@ is@@ let .
many thanks to all the activists who challenged him .
congratulations to you .
thanks to our members .
however , there is a possible hook in the form of Sat Mah@@ ar@@ aj , the Secretary @-@ General of the San@@ an Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du organization of the country .
before months , Mah@@ ar@@ aj has announced his intention to make judicial steps to be adopted , and he seems to redeem his promise .
during the General At@@ tor@@ ney Paris Al ra@@ wi , a author of the law said that it would be quite good when Mah@@ ar@@ aj would be w@@ ished against the law , most of the social media users would be interested in the subject of different social media users .
Patri@@ cia Wor@@ rel@@ l proposed :
Dear Sat , if we say instead of the discussion so generally , in a way that we invite you to talk to the state in our bedrooms , &quot; simply targeted about it that they may be ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ twe@@ et men who are ab@@ used to them in advantage , &quot; would you be willing to continue the discussion ?
or do you believe that there is no problem ?
however , whether it comes to an accus@@ ation against the law , or not , these legislation is an important step - however , there is still places in the world , on which the children &apos;s before in different gra@@ dations or remains the standard , even though there is laws that they may teach .

after we have heard the messages ( on the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we set everything to select snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the possibility to read the content of de@@ centr@@ alized and distributed .
this can help users to see at least any Wikipedia contents , even if they can &apos;t reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ a.@@ org itself .
IP@@ FS also provided that this step was independently carried out in the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is only for screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .

S@@ ob@@ Gir@@ i was with the photos that he saw around it , never satisfied . they were spar@@ ed with po@@ or@@ ly positi@@ onable mot@@ ives and balanced colors .
the motiv@@ ated him to wear and try to gra@@ ze the situation .
then he was a child .
today , at the age of 28 , S@@ hr@@ ine has ende@@ av@@ oured to bring into the international stage for the Tier@@ welt .
and his home right next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , it offers the perfect opportunity to shoot photos depic@@ ting attention to Nep@@ och@@ ian wildlife .
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ class situation helps in his work :
I live at the edge of the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could it give better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just rested at home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) had called me . he had received a call from my father , that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river a Leopard .
the river bank is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I went off with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father observed him and showed me the place on the other river side where the Leopard was found and I immediately began to put pictures to Kni@@ p@@ sen ! !
S@@ elec@@ ts a co @-@ operation with the authorities to obtain worldwide recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature and want to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not so fear@@ ful as they look like .
and he should know it , because he got Tig@@ ers already from face to face toward the face :
a tig@@ ers can &apos;t distur@@ b by the mind of the sheep ! !
late evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
I was also because of the darkness on the way home , when suddenly the king of the bush appeared . he immediately places to see us , and he star@@ red me through the S@@ al @-@ trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , S@@ ES placed the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click on environmental protection ) on its photos .
however , its passion for the promotion of Nep@@ als nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he was waiting for 22 days , and lived there in a tent to take pictures from Ot@@ ters . up to 12 days it took it until he could photograph a tiger and live six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds , who live near the tourist information .

years after the marriage , Indian women discuss the name of their hus@@ bands for the first time .

this entry was posted by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally issued on Video Vol@@ unte@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community organisation from India .
a revised version was again published as part of a Content @-@ Sh@@ aring @-@ Convention .
in many parts India avoid women with greatest care , the name of their hus@@ bands , or even older men in the family .
instead , they use a Pr@@ onom@@ en or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ echn@@ is@@ gar@@ h to Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra and Ut@@ t@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h women to respect her husband to the husband , as well as the fear of the consequences , they should ab@@ normal@@ ized this practice on life .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was sentenced by a head@@ count and viol@@ ated by her family and the community of the village , after having had an attached relatives with names .
the tradition of their wives also did not call on the name , is also widespread among men . however , they have far less evidence to be feared if at all , they should not come after this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health professionals and house@@ wives , a unique club and thus became fast to the main round table of the city .
it is a place solely for them alone to discuss and discuss the host@@ esses of the patri@@ arch@@ ate .
when one of 56 clubs there are in 13 Indian countries , he is part of the campaign # K@@ help Bad@@ al , which is operated by the community video Vol@@ unte@@ ers and is committed to mining the patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was works for seven years with the help of her vide@@ oc@@ am@@ era at the discovery of practitioners , such as children &apos;s heating up to the ban of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS infected , and guides these clubs .
it reports about how these clubs were created a safe place for these women and have made them at the same time to amb@@ ass@@ adors of the wall .
the first video , the Roh@@ ini revealed in their discussion round , did not support women who would not call her hus@@ bands on their name .
she op@@ ted for this topic because they wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which the women can easily identify .
according to the names of their hus@@ bands , they are not able to express them all their comm@@ it@@ ments and never put in question .
raw ini mean :
this tradition test@@ i@@ fies that a woman respec@@ ts her husband and wishes to him a long life .
a woman who doesn &apos;t stick in it is regarded as a woman without murder .
the tradition is so deeply ro@@ oted that we have never made us to this discussion round about this discussion round .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband to date , previously tried at home , try out at home , as it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion round of her husband and her mother in law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother in law and my husband stayed yet long after the video was at the end .
Pra@@ k@@ ash , my husband , turned back to me , and said , I should name him now in his name .
Roh@@ ini started their first discussion car with this self @-@ confidence in their luggage .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; never before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women were protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in Ut@@ t@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection the women tried to bring the discussion with a exercise in gear .
Roh@@ ini asked every participant in the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , off@@ ended , sad , loving and so on .
then she asked them , &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us what they want , means that they don &apos;t respect us ?
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of their hus@@ bands on her lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was in the village of Wal@@ he in Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra on the breaking of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which women also married the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini tells :
one woman was so so@@ ber that during all the exercise , it was just before him ; another decided to allow the whole fru@@ stration against him and his family by allowing him to curse him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
even in the A@@ dr@@ en@@ al@@ in@@ ese above , with an ancient ro@@ g@@ ly , the women decided to try out at home to name her husband &apos;s hus@@ bands in their name .
and they kept their word .
in the next days , Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini , asked what ideas put them in the head : his wife could not stop his name .
another pl@@ ub@@ ic member decided to do it while dinner before the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law was sorry , she was afraid , and said that there was an error .
another woman said , &quot; Roh@@ ini said , &quot; I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant was less under@@ stand@@ able and the situation art@@ ed in violence .
Roh@@ ini reported how women have tried to stop other practices , such as the wearing of the cin@@ o@@ ber@@ red point on the fore@@ head that shows the Eh@@ est@@ atus :
why must only women show that they are married ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said to my husband that I would bear the cin@@ o@@ ber@@ red point when he would do it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laugh@@ ed only and I heard that , to wear it .
the other women don &apos;t have stopped completely , but they think they are now in a better position to choose myself on some days .
for many women , the discussions club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip at every discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
usually we packed lun@@ ches and water go out into the field .
I don &apos;t want to make sure that the women may make what could hear , &quot; says she .
during the last months , she celebrated their own birth@@ days in her life with cakes ; they d@@ anced and sang and talked about things that they had never done before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years now and yet I have talked about some things , for example how our ident@@ ities are linked to our hus@@ bands still never been hon@@ est@@ ly .
it feels great to say certain things to say anything , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round , we have talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with clothing .
some women in the group have only been borne in Sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most , the okay , but some wanted to bear a sal@@ o @-@ c@@ ta , a wide shirt via a tro@@ users , they don &apos;t have dar@@ ed .
after a lot of dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own clothing choice , the mor@@ als associated with the Sar@@ is and much more , tast@@ ed raw car@@ ini in a discussion round , so that women could bear them .
next , they have decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a to get a trip to Go@@ a where they can carry je@@ ans and make raw materials that they will be able to create it .
on the question whether in the five months since their first discussion club has already changed slightly , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are getting slowly into the roll :
so far we have done so small steps .
some women tried it a few times , but then they list@@ ened to the name of her husband .
some , including me , make it still , but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved .
one or two shall still say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women bear at each time Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their fore@@ heads .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes that they want to reach in their lives - like the hur@@ ries for more freedom of movement or the own dress code - at the end of a difficult to navigate the river .
by making their own self @-@ confidence , they are aware of that they are sitting in the same boat .
how the Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a sacrifice of patri@@ arch@@ ats .
I am there too .
but this club , each of us , indicates that something is changing .
and I know that it is not limited to only 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman in the club goes home and others talking about what we speak about what we do and what we do .
we are all in the same boat .

a new system of kidn@@ ap heads for the organ@@ ism , presumably for super@@ st@@ itious purposes , troubled the police from Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambi@@ que . the local government now called a number of operations into life to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from the border of Malawi .
one of the victims was be@@ headed and had been taken part of the organs .
two men were arrested and arrested in the consequence , that the organs of Sh@@ aman in Tanzania and Malawi are used .
it ad@@ mits to the local super@@ st@@ ition that could bring the head of a glorious man &apos;s gold or riches , explained the police officer of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia of the BBC .
it is the first time that consecutive attacks were registered on he@@ avi@@ est men in Moz@@ ambi@@ que .
another group , the aim of ex@@ h@@ ort@@ ations for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to that the UN to investigate a mission in the South African country in 2016 to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of Southern Africa , particularly in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government campaigns to fight these super@@ st@@ itions and fight parts .
U@@ com@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who are preparing to go into the country :
attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Moz@@ ambi@@ que are the goal of rit@@ ual men in Moz@@ ambi@@ que , the Mos@@ ambi@@ que Police drove to the most recent ex@@ h@@ ort@@ ation of three glorious men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the h@@ ort@@ ations took place .
Hus@@ hai Al@@ gy Ad@@ amo , student and the inhabitants of the city of In@@ ham@@ bane , said that the local police arrived to the case :
PR@@ M believes that the Sh@@ aman has been involved in the death of glorious men &apos;s death .
the persecution and murder of gl@@ ass@@ ump@@ ed individuals for the profit and sale of their organs in the district Mor@@ avian mur@@ als , has been given cultural moti@@ fs , which even shows the police of the Republic of Moz@@ ambi@@ que ( PR@@ M ) , which also exist that a faith could exist , according to the victims in the head might have power the rich@@ ness of wealth .
in the last days three men were murdered with hair loss problems in this part of the country .
Angela Fer@@ re@@ ira Sam@@ an@@ tha divided the chron@@ icles of the blo@@ g@@ gers poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , who stated that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty in which Moz@@ ambi@@ que is related :
I would like to go to E@@ IN Mos@@ ambi@@ que , THE S@@ ME , a country where the teachers would have taken care for good notes , work and other achievements to make their bread , to earn their bread , a country where neither the Al@@ bin@@ os still ref@@ res@@ h or believers , who aim to aim to get a fast wealth .
in spite of the seri@@ ousness of the phenom@@ ena , some of the opportunity for ma@@ kab@@ s recommendation do not escape .

a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , probably was probably made recently .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of in@@ pris@@ oned Chinese dis@@ sidents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has moved attention to international community attention after his lawyer had been announced at the end of June that he was hosp@@ ital@@ ized due to liver cancer in the End@@ stage hospital .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state end@@ anger@@ ment ) after being challenged in the draft Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that calls for the democratic re@@ forms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has referred the case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a nar@@ rator tells that he has not considered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yet China still gets views from the international community , the Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , Di@@ chter@@ in Li@@ u X@@ ia , who permit a treatment abroad .
while some countries have critic@@ ised the str@@ ingent treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely se@@ eded to the topic .
Hong Kong Free Press has brought a few reactions from abroad .
United Nations
Z@@ eid Ra @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Commissioner of the United Nations for Human Rights , arrived at the end of June Chinese servants to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a speaker refused to comment on whether the United Nations pressure should ex@@ ert to enable Li@@ u in foreign countries .
Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ø@@ r@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
the relationship between China and Norway came into the stores after the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 was best@@ owed to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government over@@ took that this did not do with the decision to do with the decision .
the diplomatic relations have been resum@@ ed only in December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to return to China , since the exports had been blocked since 2010 .
after the message was spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee brought his hope for an un@@ conditional release , and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment , he was unable to increase his prize .
during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a decision to liber@@ ate Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and to allow him to seek medical support where he wants .
the leading diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini also called for the release of Li@@ us , as she ha@@ sted in a declaration on June 30 :
we at the same time we expect to raise any limitations of Mr. Li@@ us wives as well as family members .
they are supposed to meet and receive all visits that they wish , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
USA
U.S. ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told that the Americans say &quot; him that he has the opportunity for the treatment of foreign countries , so that it may be helpful in his satisfaction . &quot;
an spokes@@ person on the U.S. Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on June 27 that the embassy failed to release the Chinese authorities , not only to release Li@@ u , but also his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from their house arrest .
the US Embassy re@@ affir@@ med a desert response from China to themselves , with the implementation of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; no country have the right to become a single and indisp@@ ens@@ able remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared that China should offer the following :
protection and freedom , such as travel and access to the medical care of his choice , which they have been entitled to Chinese constitution and legal obligations in accordance with international obligations .
the US Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz also introduced a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to push back Li@@ u and his wife un@@ conditional .
I challenge China to release the Nobel Prize lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ conditional , so that he can give it a proper medical treatment . ht@@ t@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the medical support gets that he needs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping appeared on July 7 and 8 at the G20 summit in Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources in Beijing reported a Reuters News Agency , that China had great concerns if the host could visit Li@@ u visit the visit in Hamburg .
Canada
on 28 June , the Canadian ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um , called for China to provide a reasonable medical care and give him the opportunity to provide themselves of his family .
Li@@ us An@@ w@@ alt told AF@@ P that Li@@ us Woman , Li@@ u X@@ ia , who could visit him every day , but the police always supervised the room in the hospital , and that it is not permitted to speak to someone outside , including his lawyers , and contact us .
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells you :
Canada requires China to release his international human rights , including freedom of opinion , which per@@ mitting the exercise of this rights .
France
France &apos;s Foreign Ministry ur@@ ged China to release on June 29 for humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures have to be taken in order to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all treatments which he needs , regardless where , needs . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact to him .
although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would be welcome in the country , the Foreign Ministry announced that there would be no further information that France will eventually capture it .
Taiwan
the Council of festiv@@ ities in Taiwan ur@@ ged China on 27 June to allow Li@@ u to allow a larger tolerance to those that require peaceful funds to demand political re@@ forms and democratic development .
in China , the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ator Yu Me@@ i @-@ n@@ u has also called for China to allow the sick intellec@@ tu@@ als to allow themselves to treat themselves in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed herself in a statement on June 28 by Li@@ u very careful and gave to pray that many have asked him to pray for Li@@ us Wohl@@ gem@@ s .
he spoke about Li@@ u :
it is my faith , that the initiatives were , which he took and had brought forth to a harmon@@ ic , more stable and we@@ al@@ thy China , what again had contributed to a peaceful world .
I personally felt very moved and encouraged , when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , which is inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the Charter 08 signed to democracy , freedom and law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .
license : CC@@ 0 Dom@@ aine Public
is Singapore a city or a country ?
the question may appear stup@@ id since Singapore is recognized as an independent state since Singapore .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , Singapore should be considered a city .
this statement has triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting during a meeting of the international branch of the State of New York , the Minister that many people critic@@ ized the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared to Singapore with other countries .
he support that Singapore should be considered a city .
... no one has made a question whether New York is a democracy ...
that is , with most people go an error .
I have tried to declare that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io acc@@ accused the Minister of Justice , &quot; to do logic , &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore .
and then , according to all our efforts and adv@@ ances , this valuable country , we hear that we would not be there any land .
it was so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of a flight before the responsibilities , a mandatory violation .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it ?
the reasons mentioned by Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am were not very Nobel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries , in view of what he appeared un@@ wei@@ rd .
on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to Chicago , San Francisco or New York as well as those cities which are permanently run by a party .
these cities are democratic .
once you reach the core point of the subject , again the good old breast from the author@@ itarian sei@@ z@@ ers return to be Democrats deser@@ ve the turning logic , because they fit better to their power .
in the final issue of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , the last week of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am gave answers to his American guests in regards to our press , our J@@ udi@@ k@@ ative , our political system really non @-@ answers .
these questions mean with non @-@ answers to rati@@ onal type .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am on his mind , because they did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city is to which country belongs to our city ...
in short , I understand nothing .
I would be very grat@@ eful if our new K Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am would take on the effort to clari@@ fy this point where he was paid up in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
by clicking on the blog , he has published his comment on the reviews that you should start to understand the whole tran@@ script of the conference , in order to understand the context of the statements by Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am better , according to those of Singapore had a city and no country .
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he declared that the elections in Singapore said so un@@ easy , even if we are looking forward to a free and just election . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he distributed Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities have seen a party in decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said , Singapore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is no country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has obviously not meant in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows its dis@@ appointment over Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , who makes such pol@@ em@@ ic statement as leader of a her@@ on @-@ growing generation .
I am talking about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said very much ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de that I expected to do with them or not , but this is another matter .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , a member of the new generation of the political leader of Singapore , I have doub@@ ts and I &apos;m not once sure that he really believes , correctly associated and aware of what he def@@ ends .
the Tem@@ as@@ ek review sets the weak spots of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ ams Arg@@ um@@ ni :
does Mr. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am has committed an error &quot; ? or was it a Fre@@ ud@@ ger spokes@@ person ?
if Singapore is no country , we are considered independent and so@@ vereign state ?
if not , on which country go back the so@@ vereign rights of the city of Singapore ?
Singapore is unique , it is an equally country and town .
since he plays an important role within the government cabinet , the statements by Mr Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am is of serious importance .
why do the Singap@@ ore@@ dom do their military service , they defend their own country , but not their country ?
who must pay our Prime Minister In@@ voices ?
what is the value of our pink number of identity ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
in this way , the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade for the Be@@ ing , Singapore is and always a city :
&quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot;
this proposition seems to have become more expensive people of Singapur ...
no one has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we were always a city / island state .
I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; the defense of the country especially &quot; etc . , but that &apos;s not true .
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .

global Vo@@ ices asked short of his editors : what is the most common aspect of your home or home country ?
their answers will be published here as part of a continuing line with the rum@@ or of certain parts of the world , and another fac@@ et should be shown .
the latest install@@ ment of this series comes from Nev@@ is Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question that is set to me in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am coming from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been living in Japan again since 1994 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the situation , in which situation takes place , it is considered to be cour@@ te@@ ous , interested in his talk partner , looking for personal questions .
on my clari@@ fication , most often the standard answer is : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice @-@ hockey , nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans cook maybe indoor , if they are kept for Americans , but me do not distur@@ b me .
for someone who does not know , there is little , distingu@@ ishes us Canadian of Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans have a Canadian flag well visible on their back@@ pack if they are travelling .
all love Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans , however , Americans ... .
so it was already when I began 20 years ago to travel through the world - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Can@@ adi@@ ans already carried out little monkey leaves on their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care !
there is no weapons with us !
gender marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think , Canada is so great .
we are cour@@ te@@ ous .
we are obviously very often &quot; sorry . &quot;
Canada is supp@@ os@@ edly regarded as the toler@@ ant country against ethnic groups .
we are not like these types south of the border .
we are Canadian .
I hate it .
first , I have many American friends I ad@@ mi@@ red .
it would make me nothing , if you would like to change Johnny from Dallas for example .
with Marc out of Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or by Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
first : as &quot; nice &quot; signi@@ fies , is basically to be di@@ ligent to be di@@ spar@@ ed - such as the ben@@ evol@@ ent , gentle , but trag@@ ically un@@ important figure N@@ ed Flanders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( one &apos;s own Canadian double ) .
if Canada is really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flanders , this would be a step forward . but the real problem exists that &quot; nice &quot; no personality has .
there are no corners and edges , nothing at which you can stum@@ ble .
harm@@ less , is un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ interesting to earn and no attention .
this may be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , re@@ mot@@ ely from the things to pass around .
I would even go far as far as to say that the desire is to be free and alone to be a main building of the Canadian .
we tend to worry about our own affairs .
what a &quot; nice &quot; signi@@ fy as &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps just cool polit@@ eness .
Can@@ adi@@ ans don &apos;t talk about the fence with the neighbours .
we lack the warm warm , open kindness , which I connect to my American friends .
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) , Just@@ in Tru@@ de@@ au entered the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada almost sexy .
music video of a pop band par@@ odi@@ zed in Thailand
one in Thailand famous Pop @-@ Band has published a music video which gave the Jun@@ ta par@@ odi@@ zed who seized power and re@@ igns in 2014 despite their promise to the civilian government .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ w@@ Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man , who tells what regulations make his gir@@ l@@ friend .
although not expressly polit@@ ically , the music video also refers to the continued military dom@@ ination of the Jun@@ ta .
the band was created by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video for song was a huge success .
within the first three days , this was dealt with a up@@ loaded video 1.@@ 254 times and received 8.@@ 800 Li@@ kes .
last month , the Charlie @-@ Chap@@ lin video &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists appear to watch the public .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entert@@ aining introduction to Thai policies , especially in particular how it with@@ holds the country &apos;s position under the Jun@@ ta rule .
look at once these pictures of the video , which relate to some of the political issues , which Thailand has been hard @-@ pursued in the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the dra@@ con@@ ical section 44 of the provisional constitution , which the Commander in Chief of the He@@ aler opposing important national issues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious programme for &quot; integration of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other persons who are considered a critic by the Jun@@ ta .
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crimin@@ ality , whose v@@ ague and un@@ clear regulations are often used by the authorities to express activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was set up in the army , supervised the online content , and persons , accused of having accused the monarchy , prosec@@ uted and prosec@@ uted .
Thailand sets a strict key to &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ ority &quot; ) .
on 20 May 2014 , the war was proclaimed by the War Law .
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
one of the problems , which the Jun@@ ta continues to purchase , is its decision to buy U @-@ boats , although security professionals were warning , that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste from taxes .
in the video , even how people are thrown into a black delivery car before attemp@@ ting to bring them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem case .

the post @-@ war company recovered only very slowly into East @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
now over 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ ab@@ ch@@ as@@ ian war officially ended , but his sc@@ ars are still visible in this part of the republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show distinctive pictures .
villages like D@@ zh@@ an@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and Khar@@ chil@@ ava are in the carbon pool of Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , miss@@ ile Asia , Geor@@ gier and Armen@@ ians lived and worked on Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today , the biggest part of Russians live and off in the area .
such settlements are also called cl@@ amps .
in the pre @-@ war period there were more than 10.000 people , today there are only few hundred people in those cl@@ ashes .
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district was 16,000 people , having barely increased over one decade .
in 1989 about 43@@ ,000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a consequence of war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ storey blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 60s , called Ch@@ ru@@ sch@@ t@@ sk@@ kov@@ sky , are symbolic for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are fallen and very rare they are inhabited by more than two families .

I met a native older man at the entrance of the village of D@@ zh@@ an@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
he starts a conversation and it &apos;s hard to finish this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; why do you speak ?
it is still unique . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
there were community centers , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens , who served all the community .
now there is only paved street with infl@@ amed glory buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and had their contribution to the central planning of the Soviet Union , have left the district .
in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ zh@@ an@@ tu@@ k@@ ha about fifty inhabitants live .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the Ch@@ ru@@ sch@@ t@@ ow@@ kas that can accommodate one or two families , one recogni@@ zes on the balconies where they are dry .
two young girls , both seven years old , look at the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover the camera in the hand , they move away immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Mother has forbidden us to photograph ourselves &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girl . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is forbidden to us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ per@@ ed to her gir@@ l@@ friend and suddenly leaving the destroyed buildings and van@@ ish .
many people in the area are working for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ ug@@ ol .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence industry ( cultivation of agricultural products for the own need ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetables .
it is difficult to come on the laps .
the district administration provided free candles in winter for free and bread .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what is going to happen , but we will be zu@@ cch@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about ten years ago , an older woman moved to Gal@@ ina ( or a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a , as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Al Jaz@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
in spite of her oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left off par@@ ch@@ ies to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ ch@@ asia , &quot; she tells them .
Gal@@ ina wants to receive no financial aid from her daughter , and insi@@ sts that she supports their young grand@@ son instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly R@@ ente are just 9 dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a sweet garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a tells that she and other vill@@ agers try to meet regularly and holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman and a young family and I live in this building .
if holidays are , we visit us .
but we cannot do this - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot;
while she tells her story , a younger neigh@@ bors appear on the balcony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ asha , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; call@@ eth to a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said we could build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already prepared the floor .
I don &apos;t know what happen , but we will build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; you can get to anything ... &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as talks in Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and five common children living in their house for a few days .
Nat@@ asha was 11 years old when the war began .
they are remin@@ is@@ cent of the village before the war .
despite the relatives that live in Central Europe , Oss@@ et@@ ia and Georgia ( the country Ab@@ ch@@ asia was simply gone ) , they had not had the opportunity to leave it .

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital city in Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build an house there , but this will take a bit longer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it re@@ comp@@ assed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha is receiving approximately $ 9 child for each child .
her husband works in the cab@@ bage ru@@ be .
the young family has its own farm .
in the vicinity of the house where Nat@@ asch@@ as kinder@@ garten was once found , they kept pigs , cows , h@@ äh@@ ne and chickens .
she told that it was a very anxi@@ ous situation , when many people left the village after the war .
but in the course of time they lost their fears .

&quot; we have no fear of the dark street or the few people .
you can get to everything .
many people believe that this building was destroyed during the war .
but indeed , it has somewhat to do with pill@@ age .
after the war , there were hardly work and all lived as it was right .
I remember every day as the city and the war were once . &quot;
when our conversation is ended , a small boy is passing through us .
he runs through the window of a destroyed building and hidden .
a ball flies from the window and another young ch@@ ase him .
he plays with the ball , which then pushed the hills .
one group of children pursu@@ es the ball .
while they run , some of them stones falling into the ru@@ ined buildings .
these ruins are part of their childhood which provide for un@@ circumcised in her life .

in Mexico home &quot; Mama Africa &quot; migrants on their long voyage
Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez is a small hotel in tap@@ est@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , near Mexico to Guatemala .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our Partners PR@@ I.@@ org , and appears here with friendly permission .
in the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , certain places will be known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these locations in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located on the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is managed by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican , a little woman with a coral @-@ pink Br@@ illi@@ en@@ frame and gold coloured ear@@ ring in t@@ ed@@ dy mol@@ dy form .
it is called Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . however , they know many among the name of Mama Africa .
this first name is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a goal for Afri@@ cans and Ha@@ iti@@ ans who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for approximately $ 2.50 dollars per night , guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , cro@@ pping walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .
there is no sign to the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Hawai@@ ian migrants here .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez , the people are coming in full small bus@@ hes and from the upper part of the coast they start to call : &quot; m@@ om Africa !
where are you M@@ om Africa ? &quot;
at the time it is rather quiet but in this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept without cart@@ ons .
they don &apos;t want to re@@ ject .
she also helps them and bring them to the hospital when they are sick , they buys them medicines that they could not pay them with a bal@@ m that were troubled by the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebast@@ i@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived at a short time ago .
I asked him if m@@ om Africa was a reasonable name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Sebast@@ i@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a yo@@ ungst@@ ers ) take place with Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel that it fits to her because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very lov@@ ingly .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebast@@ i@@ ao travels to Boston with his sister , who hopes to get to Boston to return to her husband and the three children .
you have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans , who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then go towards the north .
the family had heard of other sign@@ atories of Mama Africa . &quot; m@@ om Africa is a well @-@ known name on the route , &quot; explained Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he tells that Ha@@ iti@@ an and Afri@@ kaner is often travelling together , and that Afri@@ cans speak on W@@ hat@@ s@@ App by Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
as many of his sign@@ atories , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the soccer world championships .
when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he started his journey into the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa since months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus to Ti@@ ju@@ ana .
I ask him if he is in the future with Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez &apos;s contact .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; m@@ om Africa is our mother and we never leave it again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered sm@@ iling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells that her guests will send their often text message if they have gone to gre@@ et her or to report her about the course of their trip .
it explains that their Christian faith is the drive of their work .
they don &apos;t know much about Africa , but their guests have taken her to prepare chicken as in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known , but it is not the only radio hope for migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city a lift pass leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
in this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family lived in their small house .
he is polic@@ eman and has found that the bus visits to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive .
he began to help them to receive a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar the night .
at the moment , there are 25 persons , mostly Ha@@ iti@@ an .
some sleep on ceilings on the ground but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have experienced what they experienced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the border over the wilderness and suffered suffered .
there are places where people help and help others . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support . &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was exp@@ elled from the United States following a raid in the United States .
the majority of migrants who travels across Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other inhabitants also open the doors of their houses for them .
José Antonio C@@ ord@@ ova Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children from before men who wanted to take money from him without a plan .
in Tap@@ est@@ ula , he asked for an accommodation and a unknown , a variety of stone , has its roof offered to him .
a few months later , the family still lives and tries to decide where the next steps should go .
back in the house of Mama Africa , everything is full of guests .
in the course there are the trav@@ ellers quiet@@ ly their phones .
a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has 20 new guests , most of Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy about that her house is full , but it is nost@@ al@@ g@@ ish , because of them that go away .
like a proud grand@@ mother , she cri@@ eth her album with many photos .
there are one of her daughter with African hairs which you made a client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .
she laugh@@ ing grieved , while she briefly presented her .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ eron , &quot; repe@@ ats every time . &quot; you have gone already . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication tools in X@@ inj@@ ang from Twitter users . programs : du@@ st@@ ats .
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic min@@ orities region in the west of China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on 10 July , the mobile phones in the Ti@@ an@@ shan District of the Ur@@ um@@ qi District received a mobile phone information where it shows the District government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; web cleaning &quot; ) .
in the notification , the app &quot; must hin@@ ts that the app will have access to terrorist information . &quot;
but the authorities used the app to use the app for more than the fight of terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ fecture , because she had installed the app , news with a private We@@ Chat group .
in the notification of the police , the app that determine the sources and the distribution boxes of the terror@@ ists would determine and persec@@ ute , together with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ w@@ angs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elecom .
the main function is the option of por@@ no@@ graphic Websites , from online fr@@ aud , Tro@@ ians and Ph@@ ishing pages to make users attention to make sure how much time they spend online and control your own home network .
the app for min@@ ors for min@@ ors should help children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can be used in a variety of ways .
for example , the remote control &quot; state actors or even h@@ acker can handle the home network of a person to manip@@ ulate or steal .
this introduction is in line with other measures for control of digital activities in this region .
while news about digital c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in China usually focused on the experiences of users in the bigger cities in the East and south , the reality is very often dark for those who are in remote @-@ pressed ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
to limit the rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict areas , authorities often arrange extreme barri@@ ers and surveillance measures to as well as rout@@ in@@ ely internet ab@@ sten@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that on Twitter based media Out@@ let &quot; images from &quot; China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Cor@@ respon@@ dents ) , which were cen@@ sored news in China , showed photos of a Check@@ point , in the polic@@ emen who had already checked the residents &quot; surveillance app . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification required that people will install the app within 10 days .
if you have discovered at a Check@@ point with a device without these software , it could be taken up to 10 days .
this is a blow for technological development .
they are forced to use devices that are intended for older people .
this is a form of the captivity by the rest technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from &quot; China &quot; ( Cor@@ respon@@ sive coun@@ sel@@ dom ) released a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , which allows the software to raise the password requirement of a Windows operating system , and thus receiving un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard drive .
after installation of j@@ ing@@ w@@ ang computers and cell@@ phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang to electronic hand@@ sch@@ elles .
the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may have a reaction to minim@@ ize the statements of the town council , to minim@@ ize the spread of illegal content .
all government branches , authorities and related facilities including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions on Cyber@@ security office to operate your computer and communications equipment .
a recent report by Freedom House , a US @-@ American human rights organization , also mentioned these new monitoring methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang the authorities published on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi a regulation with the order to all residents and entrepren@@ eurs until August 1 , their &quot; personal ID cards , cell@@ phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ eb@@ ooks , and media memory cards at the local police .
&quot; &quot; &quot; intention is obvious to identify and destroy any &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrorist videos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; this promotion does not viol@@ ate the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole range of other hope , including those who relate to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sleep or death , part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death
single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; sleep or death , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison .
far away from our blue , virtual world you look at and set sure you &apos;re very alone at a place where everything is important .
everything has broken down and reveals a truth , which is clearly visible , both from inside and outside .
one who makes her name all honor .
one who feel in a list of feelings and squ@@ ee@@ zing , that allow no met@@ aph@@ ors to leave .
but when you come back the reality , and you look behind the scenes - beyond the play , the beautiful scenes and the actors - turn the characters in beings from meat and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death .
all doub@@ ts solve in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even if the earth is going on on the axis of the evil , it becomes clear that you are caught between the walls that your parents , and in front of them your grand@@ parents , stone for stone .
they have arrested me and my father three times , but this was not enough to learn &quot; my lesson &quot; as the chief of the security commission that it formulated the fourth time that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he set his power concerning us , by being destroyed even the sim@@ pl@@ est concepts that we knew .
five young people were torn down during a peaceful protests like the dar@@ nel from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it was enough to break the city the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; Schrei@@ er .
all the cit@@ ations were cov@@ eted only my own .
for the first time it was still , rainy , for the wrong time , even though I had no high demands on a city that is up to the arter@@ ies with state security and their compli@@ ments .
in the third night things the things had something cal@@ ming after the power supply had ceased to work in the quarter .
I broke the silence , by taking several times &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; out of my house roof .
I stopped my voice through the silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt enough to get together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we serve us a splendid picture that filled my expectations and filled all of them .
in such a moment it will be aware of that you have delivered the spirit from the lamp , but it is not interested in the straight line .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make you ready , we meet at the military security building &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put it on .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey may go down - nothing can return your voice , after you have taken the whole way up to the office of the Security Service from the body .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I was now .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to talk , &quot; Let me hear , as you are &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; or you &apos;re only cour@@ age@@ ous enough to cry out if we are not near . &quot;
his h@@ ak@@ y eyes set up on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and thou g@@ rief right what I have seen in the eyes and not on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then did nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building .
perhaps it was on my fol@@ ly , vanity ; perhaps at the revolution .
I was so sure when I answered , &quot; I haven &apos;t thought that you have already forgotten my voice since yesterday .
and I think I never heard that in the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
it was the shortest conversation , which could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I have no word from what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is in sol@@ itary and his father equally with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; his father is equal with it . &quot;
the stri@@ fe of this ver@@ flu@@ ous set lies in the nose to today .
he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a se@@ el@@ ic torture which I was exposed for months .
I run the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with myself .
then again through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the single cells .
I prepared every details exactly before I cared for the room .
otherwise , otherwise they have been assigned a larger cell to me this time .
I have to share them with only one another prisoner , and can immediately put it immediately , without what else I have to wait for permission .
after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the officials left the cell , and I dropped to an old tried method : with the f@@ ist against the wall .
I knew that my cell @-@ fin was a &quot; Er@@ s@@ th@@ det@@ ling . &quot;
after a long time , he turned to me .
apparently , in any of the surrounding cells , a respected mean age was found , which is similar to me and called &quot; The Doctor . &quot;
in the perfect darkness doesn &apos;t recognize any prominent eye prints , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all only numbers .
&quot; maybe som@@ eb@@ ody who sounds like my sounds ? &quot;
all answers to its existence .
perhaps he was re@@ located in one of the large cells .
perhaps he will stop immediately .
the investig@@ ator had as@@ sures me , they would fre@@ t him when I abide .
Lü@@ g@@ ner .
I would have had a bird @-@ row to drive all these c@@ rows that lab@@ elled against the fruits in the garden of my head lab@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from afar off I still list@@ ened to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All ahu &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must be at approximately 10 o &apos;clock in the evening and always at this time the cri@@ es , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black saw the color of this der@@ ision , until I saw the yellow light that turned to us in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Donn@@ er , &quot; an@@ gu@@ ardi@@ ans on 13th S@@ ure of Kor@@ an ) .
&quot; they are here to listen to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was the secret revealed : to protect the state security before us , and to prevent the tra@@ itors and terror@@ ists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wit@@ ty dial@@ ect - thus they played their con@@ gressi@@ onal reading card and conce@@ aled the close eye view of their world view .
this is not a house , here is no land ; it is a curse , whom they state co @-@ exist@@ ent to transform the crimin@@ als of their sound into a hero .
I cared for the audi@@ ble and meet at Abu I@@ mad , a slim and persistent man ; at least it comes to me so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he starts a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; despite the fac@@ ial expres@@ sions , who are still young , you &apos;re still young , you can join this bapt@@ ises and to protest to demonstrations , and to find demonstrations soon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I answered not .
I used it to answer me , not to answer .
I can really say no more , when ins@@ ults and stro@@ kes after a friendly conversation has become too common communication .
when and what happened was , un@@ important .
any voice in me said that I had to be acc@@ ust@@ omed to be angry , though I had done nothing to make this penalty .
in punishment in all their diversity .
his command is to rip me as much as possible from the body .
he calls the lov@@ ingly &quot; conf@@ ession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe which probably comes from the clo@@ ak .
your Hen@@ ker so@@ aked at your cry .
give him the pleasure , you can &apos;t measure you with him , and you can &apos;t keep your cry .
my cry is not enough , so it is why they exchanged the pipe through a cable .
in my first arrest , I asked if the investig@@ ator had worked as a gar@@ bage collection , or whether this had belonged to normal working equipment .
they had four cables in one another for presenting us out of their sight , great invention of a giant cable .
three of them are always different from them , while I was still in the series .
I had lost any feeling in my body - and my voice , which is why I stopped to cry .
the Hen@@ ker noted the cooling down and found no pleasure in all , whence he is the next to an electrically charged staff .
electricity through all the body , enough to provide my whole neighborhood .
my half @-@ nu@@ de body , which was stretched out on the ground , was the perfect power conductor .
the de@@ af disappeared and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night .
this must have been at midnight .
I decided to sleep to sleep , and say , that was my only option .
some hours passed , that came to me as minutes .
then the call for the morning prayer .
the door opens and the morning fulfil@@ s the room &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
I am answering with the voice of a troubled young people : &quot; my Lord , my father must be terrible . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and you will be moved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they have always released me .

Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b brings the bulk of its time inside . let it go for his screen , time to his computer , and again at his couch .
but what you can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers , or his with nic@@ ot@@ ine defiled lips .
he lives in the top of his family @-@ house , which has been part of them since 1967 ; the year , in whom Israel had forced his occupation of the West Bank , and H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs were forced to flee from their village in Palestine , where they lived as fel@@ ah@@ y@@ een ( about : Farmer ) .
for six years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is a passionate activity that has surrendered to the conservative majority , and their alt@@ approved opinions about gender roles , sexu@@ ality and free speech by art and rap@@ ture .
with his music , often focusing on issues such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian . all these issues are not only found in his hom@@ etown Am@@ man Rel@@ ev@@ anz , but also in cities , that from Damascus in Syria to the whole San@@ aa in Yemen .
at the age of 25 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees itself as a man who is not restricted by bound@@ aries , and he can feel with people with the devastating consequences of foreign inter@@ ventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not open the U.S. foreign policy against the U.S. foreign policy .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b exam@@ ines his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b doesn &apos;t believe that his compassion for those who are trying to do in war zones , anything that he was born in Jordan as the &quot; Palestinian Ge@@ vol@@ at@@ eter of the second generation &quot; - so he himself , even when he was born in Jordan , has never been in Palestine .
&quot; I don &apos;t think because of my own life circumstances , &quot; emphas@@ ises H@@ d@@ ai@@ b .
then he adds : &quot; I think because I am a man , while in the water sol@@ uble Nes@@ café in two cups . it is the holy month Ram@@ adan . in this period it is scheduled to fast@@ en for Muslims from sunrise until sunset .
the Jord@@ anian law states that the public consumption of food is illegal during Ram@@ adan .
obviously H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions . on the other hand , a cup of coffee in a sen@@ tim@@ ely hot Jun@@ it@@ ag has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically , the gap al@@ izes a warm coffee and the ra@@ ke of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose into the first line of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the free sky , especially if you cast a look into the neighboring countries .
therefore , it is simply avo@@ ids basic things to do basic things - as in the public during the Ram@@ adan of water - to move up in prison .
recently , the Interior Ministry Jord@@ anian has had a show of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; L@@ eil@@ a , already for the second time .
some parliamentary elections which support the Islamic State Front , argu@@ ed that the sexual orientation of the Muslim Brotherhood - argu@@ ed that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ osexual sens@@ o , contra@@ dic@@ ts the cultural and traditional nor@@ ms of the country , and the main reason for the concert tables is .
the member and ex @-@ spokes@@ person of the Islamic Coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert was cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the S@@ ang@@ ers .
many claim that the com@@ mitt@@ ment of the band in matters like the Arab Spring , human rights and free opinion expressed in the Arab world may become more dangerous acti@@ vis@@ m that author@@ ises the Malt@@ ese legitim@@ acy regime in the entire region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a estimates the j@@ ord@@ a people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights &quot; who continue to use &quot; for intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement is probably not to be conf@@ used rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic , but actually a clear@@ er reality in Jordan reflected in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs &apos;s work clearly .
in 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b re@@ formed traditional gender standards by taking off his vision of the fate of Arab women who have vo@@ re@@ lie@@ ve sex .
the picture shows the sk@@ el@@ eton of obviously unknown , whose arms and legs appear to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the inn@@ um@@ erable women who have lost their lives by the hands of those who actually should trust .
in the past few years the number of Hon@@ orary mor@@ de &apos; has increased - the un@@ official outside .
according to human Rights Watch , the number of Hon@@ or in the year 2016 reached its zen@@ ith ; however , Jordan was still missing that Jordan has become institutional infrastructure to support women who tried to support morph@@ ing or domestic violence to be appropriate .
according to a law on the Cri@@ me of Cri@@ me in 1954 , women who are exposed to in@@ crimin@@ ating violence , &quot; must be detained at un@@ certain time in prison , &quot; and for their release is often a year @-@ long bureau@@ cr@@ atic effort as well as the guarantee on the family that the woman will not happen .
also H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs music is a great popularity and is well known to rever@@ ence the themes that are long as tab@@ oo in his country .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b den@@ ies that his work is polit@@ ically , however , he is a fact that he can not become his music , the full exposed an@@ gu@@ ards on sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression of opinion , is not being separated from politics .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity in the attack .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; the focus will be on poverty .
the list of songs that are polit@@ ically , can be continued .
in March 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b published a song entitled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is often repeated :
&quot; you are free , and every other is it . &quot;
in further development of the song , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a sort of market , in which one can get in his words , &quot; what you want , &quot; - be faith or non @-@ faith , hetero@@ gen@@ e@@ ity or homosexu@@ ality .
he not@@ ices that barely any one speaks in Jordan on the rights of gay and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on equality of L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + individuals were still strong in 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b conducted an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ an On@@ line@@ programme Ro@@ ya , later to remember that his comments were torn apart from the context , twi@@ sted and conf@@ essed his opinion .
&quot; on Youtube it was up@@ loaded without any cuts , but he was only a revised version , &quot; says he .
today H@@ d@@ ai@@ b advert@@ ises the Arabic L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that Int@@ ol@@ er@@ anz opposed to homosexu@@ als did not promise to Islam .
he mentioned Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , still remains in memory thanks to its hom@@ o@@ er@@ otic poems .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks : if Abu Nu@@ what should work later on behalf of the cali@@ ber , in the eighth century openly about homosexu@@ ality could write about homosexu@@ ality is not able to do this ?
the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;s L@@ eil@@ a or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ian kingdom there is nothing new that the government attacks on the free expression of opinion , and that progressive votes will be brought to silence .
recently , in January 2017 , the j@@ ord@@ an news service took several former government officials and members of the teacher , based on comments in social media that critic@@ ises the problems that were deeply ro@@ uted in corruption in the country .
in view of what is the concert of H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs , only the tip of ice - the actual challenge is to effect a structural re@@ thinking in the next generation of the Jord@@ anian territory .
for him , progress is an independent sign and take . Jordan has led M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; L@@ eil@@ a for the second time in a row , but the way of progress - it looks for sure that these changes take place from day to day at the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
finally H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , like millions of other Arab@@ s , are from abroad , without inter@@ ventions from abroad .
he dre@@ amed not only to bring his work to Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to experience &quot; them . &quot;
perhaps the region is , with the help of music , art and literature of a real and basic open@@ ness - and not through bombs , stre@@ e@@ un@@ itions and on artificial art . at least , he hopes it .
as far as far as it is , h@@ d@@ ai@@ b is ra@@ ging and therefore also resistance to resistance .
this report was made by the Pul@@ itzer Center on Crisis Reporting , which was a student Fel@@ low as a student Fel@@ low .
Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan .
this great , ex@@ trav@@ ag@@ ant war@@ ri@@ ots are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous the@@ ories about the Origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
it is believed that there is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which was usually delivered in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the drums , drums and dancing about over one thousand years have been delivered and from a period of time , in the armies from the West Japan , to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the Em@@ ishi to force the knee .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to gra@@ b some great seats , therefore we have a great view .
it can only be hard to imagine how big these parts are ...
a joint center in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organised a two @-@ month exhibition at W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) .
I have been watching the meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en back for long time : two side@@ cars are just to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival will make the only true truth and a breathtaking way to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and I watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 @-@ metre high @-@ car was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

rarely , outer appearance and body care is as important as in this history , because they help to re@@ maintain the Peru@@ vian youth from crimin@@ ality and promote a legitim@@ ate job such as the Fr@@ iz@@ urs .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific ocean , close to the historical centre of the capital Lima , a region with a very high crime rate , where traffic noise and illegal drug trade are everyday .
in April 2017 , a survey showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region did not feel safe .
at the same time , Peru - how many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , the appearance and therefore also the unusual hair@@ style of famous athletes such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to that more normal citizens in the experienced hands of hair@@ dresser who can form this elabor@@ ate hair@@ style .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ style , which go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , competition of the hair@@ dresser &apos;s &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os &quot; competition , which has been held since 2014 .
there , experts meet each other to show anyone who can create the ec@@ cent@@ ering L@@ ooks like you can see in the following video ( more videos about current competitions there is on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , which is located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to see her weapons against Fris@@ ian tools , and instead of bad Advice a training in the hair@@ dressing art that allows them to find work .
motiv@@ ated by this activity and the opportunities , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a profession at present in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops before the beginning of March and reported on some of their successes :
in 1995 we were the only professional school in the congregation and the district , where@@ of we are very proud , because of love to the children we have built this educational community .
Colombia : love letters to gu@@ err@@ illa
photo : Valent@@ ina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with friendly permission .
the following article is the revised version of the contribution to gu@@ err@@ illas , which has published the International Online Magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve international online magazine .
the article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love letters to people who we know ?
is it not much more important , people who feel free to meet ?
exactly this question went out to the two young Colom@@ bian activists from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Crist@@ ian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation , who inspired them to write to the campaign cart@@ as p@@ or la Re@@ conc@@ ili@@ aci@@ ón ( letters to reconciliation ) , the young people used to write gu@@ err@@ illa letters .
only recently , their country was the venue of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace agreement with the gu@@ err@@ illa movement F@@ ARC ( german : revolutionary forces of Colombia ) , which forms the collapse of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
International received the signing of peace agreement as a significant that the Colom@@ bian president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its in Nobel Peace Prize .
in front of the column there is a long way until you can talk about a real reconciliation and peace .
Gu@@ err@@ ill@@ ak@@ ele , who lived for many years in illegal camps , were exposed to war rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic and contributed around the clock their weapons to themselves in life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society also turn to life in constant anxi@@ ety and in some cases a deep hat@@ red to gu@@ err@@ illa had to take it into their ranks , and support them in building a new life .
Leonardo and Crist@@ ian convinced that the young column is close together and help to help the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : until now , thousands of people have written letters - love messages to former gu@@ err@@ illas to welcome them again in society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former gu@@ err@@ illas , which should be handed to personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the Letters of Re@@ conc@@ iliation was created on the World Summit of Peace Lau@@ re@@ ate , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Crist@@ ian had the opportunity to talk short with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ arth@@ i , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this declared that we love the people who love to write to thousands of love letters , but those who forgot to need them much more necessary .
he plans , he told him to share his love with people in this year who needed most ur@@ gent issues .
thus , the plan , letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , which now have to build a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is willing to make the dis@@ course of a history of war to a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
until now , more than 2000 letters were collected during the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&apos;@@ i have never thought that someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
a group of 40 students from the University of J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the City Council of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ on@@ ists into the camps to transfer the letters .
the members of the F@@ ARC were on how they had done earlier in order to increase the orders of their leader .
but this time they received no prec@@ epts , but letters full of people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for all parties . &quot; it is incredible how many different feelings may run in just a few hours - from anxi@@ ety to happiness and everything that between lies , &quot; told the political ignor@@ ance student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ nez Av@@ ila later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Govern@@ ors of the Valle del Cau@@ ca Province described this unforgettable experience as follows :
after being handed over the letters , a former war@@ ri@@ or led me by the camp of gu@@ err@@ illa fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ el@@ eton &quot; ( a kind of hut , where the gu@@ err@@ illas lived ) , I saw a gu@@ err@@ er , who wrote something .
I had fear , because in addition to him on the bed , a M@@ GL @-@ Pom@@ er was a dead@@ ly weapon in the village of Dor@@ n@@ rö@@ sch@@ laf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I asked him , saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hello , what do they now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am answering a letter that someone has written to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
never in my life , someone has written me something like beautiful , therefore I respond to it . suddenly the tears run over the che@@ eks .
I h@@ ug@@ ged him down , and set me beside the Granat@@ werfer .
perhaps he was sorry for the war , I was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this c@@ ashes , and wanted to help him to write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never had something different from life to war . the F@@ ARC was the only way to keep it and his six brothers before the Hung@@ er@@ to@@ d . &quot; I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mist@@ akes .
but now I know that there is a company outside there , who wa@@ its with open poor out of us .
till now I have only learned how I have to deal with weapons .
but now where peace is re@@ igns , I can learn many things and work in dig@@ nity . &quot;
new voices
at the beginning , students and some leader of the F@@ ARC came to a discussion group .
the students had grown up all over the war and the F@@ ARC were already in secret .
therefore the leader of the F@@ ARC Society declared the history of the organization , their ide@@ als and insight into their views over the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced the social in@@ justice of the State for the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can contribute to the society in this country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a goal of this order , it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
these people , who had never found their hearing , and had no election right to know that people who had often seen as a monster , and even learned them , even people with beautiful feelings that were turned up@@ turned by their circumstances and their environment was very painful for me .
the reality , in which the country lives , does me hurt .
but it comfor@@ ted me that all men - also those who have killed and so much damage , may bring us something , and give us a smile and a h@@ ug .
many former fighters have answered for the letters .
Gust@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Archbishop of Cal@@ i , the following letter :
the column was prophesied that after de@@ fo@@ rest@@ ation peace would prevail .
this is not the case .
as long as it gives un@@ equal , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will be always people who are ready to hold arms to raise up and to protect their rights and which is also justified ( ... ) .
we use the F@@ ARC now on peace , to a policy without weapons .
therefore we call all def@@ enders of peace - regardless of race , religion or ide@@ ology they belong to over all those that dream of a country in the war .
we give you our word to make our contribution and bring sacrifices , because we know from their own experience that nothing is simple . those among us who defend the life as the basis of existence , many difficulties will be im@@ pending .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .
a trans@@ ine talks about the persec@@ utions in Ch@@ echn@@ ya and the Life before Kad@@ y@@ row

it follows the translation of an article that was written by our partner A@@ ida Mir@@ mac@@ sum@@ ova and published its first publication on the OC Media website .
hom@@ osexual and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are subject to a large bandwidth of risks - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and ex@@ pressing .
with terr@@ ors have witnessed the reporting of the last months on the persecution of pregnant men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat which depends on a Dam@@ o@@ cl@@ es@@ sch@@ l on the local L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q community , is not only about night .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ y who shared some of their experiences with us and has talked about it what happened in the republic .
the L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya passed by several months ago the international stroke . after reports were published w@@ aver@@ aged , torture and killing males in the Republic of thematic .
the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina at Now@@ ja Gas@@ eta , she threw a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities , the suspected que@@ er men and took them in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; you have brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ ine , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny , grew up there .
ever since her childhood she felt that she was a woman in reality .
when they became growing , you became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was no saf@@ er place for them , why they moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ et@@ enen was experienced by the gender equality of their country woman , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina .
for fear of her life she moved to the USA last night .
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunte@@ er hel@@ per in human rights organisation .
one day was told me that someone needed my help .
this was a friend of Da@@ gest@@ an , a trans@@ ine , who put in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I was trying to help her , som@@ eb@@ ody , of whom I thought , he would be a friend , a copy of my documents , and spread it everywhere on the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . then there is no men more in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can eliminate this shame ? &quot;
after that , photos of my documents we made the round of my W@@ hat@@ s@@ app .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
when I was just doing a few grocery bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice : &quot; here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
when I turned back , I felt something in my body , but there was nothing hurt to me .
then I heard a sentence , but this time on the Che@@ chen : &quot; how long will you still honor the family ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I only know that it was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and re @-@ awak@@ ened last En@@ des in the hospital .
apparently some women had to receive everything and began to cry out .
the man was fled .
the women had a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two daughters in my right lung cancer .
OC Media : in which case were you laid - in whom the men or women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are ob@@ sol@@ ete since there is my male name , but the doctor stood and laid me to the women .
I am very grat@@ eful to him for that .
when I read his name for the first time in his office , I got to do it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ cas@@ ian name .
but he emerged as good man .
I am grat@@ eful to him that he is respec@@ t@@ ful with me .
I spent more than one month in the hospital .
last February I got dr@@ en@@ ings .
they called me , and wrote me - Related , strange , and some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of an alp@@ habet .
my family was visited by neighbours and some away .
the requested to send me to Ch@@ echn@@ ya in order to prove that everything was a lie .
they had ab@@ sur@@ d &apos; demands : some said to me , I let &apos;s prove that I had to stand up at the official television in Gro@@ z@@ ny , and say that I had not changed my family that everything was just bad , and Photoshop .
I have gr@@ ated size C - what would I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it is still difficult for them .
some elderly people once said my mother on the street .
they said to her , &quot; They have brought a monster to the world , that has not only disappointed your family , but the entire republic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we can not touch you , because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my mother became too much and she lay a Stri@@ ck around the neck .
fortunately the neigh@@ bors and saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into a flat and a few hours later , under the window a car with dar@@ kened windows and a number plate with a 95 slide show .
after it was the third time , it was clear that something was la@@ zy .
my Human Rights friends tested the number@@ ing of the number@@ ing - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how are you fled ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for safety reasons I will not give her name , but I want to say that I remember them all , they really helped me .
with their help I left the country , but then something un@@ belief .
I can &apos;t understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived .
I bought it without getting myself without identification , without everything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw them into the gar@@ bage .
arrived in and checked in the hotel .
the number was registered for a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
in the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe , you would have you in security , just because you have left the country ?
our people know , in which hotel you are using . you even know your room number .
just to prove you : it is number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine that ? !
that was really my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we don &apos;t talk about the gender equality , however , this is a tab@@ oo topic .
I still bear some traditional cas@@ ian elements still in me .
so very much I wish I cannot overcome these se@@ awe@@ ed barrier .
I always say that , as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to viol@@ ate them .
when we chat with the camera , I actually give me effort to look like the person who reminds them out of their past - thus remin@@ is@@ cent of my male form .
but that &apos;s very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do , those who have stayed ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
for the needed I needed current information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I spoke with someone to eat one and a half months in Ar@@ ri@@ gun .
he told that during Ram@@ adan it was not arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not lock a new wave .
most likely they will focus on family and relatives .
so , I think they probably charge the relations with the concerned person concerned , and in the end require a proof of evidence that the so @-@ called &quot; glory &quot; has experienced by blood .
OC Media : will now be pregnant women in these secret conditions ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of me says , there &apos;s just not many .
when , above all such that were not rich , or who were left to their relatives or who were left by their relatives to ask Kad@@ y@@ rows .
as far as I know , they will be detained in order to present them later as terror@@ ists .
say : should they be killed , they will show their bodies in television and asser@@ t them , they would have attacked your village or a military base .
do you understand ?
as if these people had not simply disappeared , but specifically under@@ min@@ ished to radi@@ alize themselves .
OC Media : is this only a mut@@ ation or have a source of information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just felt someone who was imprisoned for one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he says that many people had disappeared in this prison after her be@@ ard had grown .
there has been nothing new from them since .
they simply have taken it .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was taken up , when these people were taken .
however , they were not introduced as band@@ its until now , there were no reports so far . we believe that such actions are possible .
why else would you not allowed to shave those people ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation already in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always bore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think before 2003 I was already known throughout the whole of Gro@@ z@@ ny , when I was still living there - and I never had any problems .
on the Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sh@@ aria was , I never had any problems .
on the contrary , it was much more secure than now .
Russia originally wanted to bring us back to the &quot; civil war &quot; but ultimately thrown down in the stone period .
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows had been exhau@@ sted , I was colored eyelashes , carried tube je@@ ans and short tops .
the Ministry of Security of the Sh@@ aria has never caught a hair , too .
in front of the Russian theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people like me met .
it was a small place where several banks stood ; and the whole city knew it , they knew why men , young people met there .
we never have been off@@ ended .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a spe@@ ech@@ ing : Khar@@ da ma Khar@@ da . that means &quot; Sp@@ o@@ ons not about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
it often says to children , if they have fun on the sick .
OC Media : so did they simply shut up their eyes before you , because they believed they be sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never off@@ ended , never ch@@ ased and never beaten .
OC Media : how long did this answer time ?
Sab@@ rina : so long , until Kad@@ y@@ row came to the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to talk about Mor@@ al in television .
he spoke not about us by se , but ran@@ kings over the behaviour of women .
nevertheless - you could feel like people in the city began to change .
he who had gel@@ ding and laugh@@ ed at once , looked at once with suspic@@ ion .
in the period I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could feel the situation in the republic steadily wor@@ ried .
OC Media : which activity is now going to go right now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I earn not much - 700 to $ 800 dollars per month are not much in the United States .
I still operate as a activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communic@@ ating with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we perfectly organize te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , gath@@ er@@ ings , I beg@@ at them to the hospital and help them to get food types .
I don &apos;t attain a cent .
I discovered these people when I had a refuge .
I am Mus@@ lim@@ a and I want to help those who need help .
OC Media : bear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : this is Albanian .
so is the nature that has nothing to do with religion .
that &apos;s exactly the same as Ch@@ et@@ sch@@ ens who would like to make you with foam before the mouth that there is no sw@@ elling at them .
those who have a Cab@@ ard@@ iner who have the Russians also have the Russians also ; on the whole planet it is - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , so it is impossible to hear what to hear .
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - pract@@ ising Muslims who go into the mosque and fast@@ en during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
do you know , many thinking at tran@@ sid@@ ental complexity to men who love men and they believe that they change his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a wh@@ irl@@ wind .
these are two different things - two different types of a sensation to be exact , different living settings .
for me , it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and will not be ashamed of my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
sorry that I &apos;m so personally , but my last in@@ time relationship is already longer than a year ago .
and I am not mourning because - I simply know that I am now myself .
local groups war@@ n an increase of self @-@ mor@@ den within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran
Iranian A@@ wa@@ z region suffer from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty @-@ rate within the local Arab population .
since the last months , there has been a strong increase of self @-@ mor@@ den .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ ra@@ z .

the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i , on August 27 , rec@@ eded the ver@@ ted situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran , which is dominated by poverty and unemployment .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the A@@ wa@@ z region in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered under Ang@@ st@@ ings , depression , and he spar@@ ked himself for his own hel@@ pl@@ ess , who can come up for his family , such as Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ ra@@ z and anonymous .
one on YouTube played video kept the moments after he had kindled himself .
some people managed to delete the fl@@ ames again , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to Tal@@ eg@@ h@@ ani hospital in the town of Ah@@ ra@@ z .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; local sources &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to local sources were so strong that doctors could do nothing more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he died short time later .
it was not the only suicide who has happened in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i minority , and activists before the time that more men could take life .
the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some other - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sh@@ ah@@ ab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im .
their stories have one thing together : these were all family fathers that were based on the persecution by the Iranian government , hel@@ pl@@ ess , and ir@@ able to feed their families , safely and safe work .
Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment , and discrimination
the region in which the majority of Iran living in Iran living in the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community was sh@@ aken by a pro@@ found economic crisis , which makes it difficult to fight the native of the local Arab population .
in front of a century , Arab Ah@@ ra@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ahl@@ avi Mon@@ archy was taken over and in 1925 great efforts to end the ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the A@@ wa@@ z region there are some of the largest in Iran next to oil and gas areas as well as some of the most abundant and valuable usable area for Iranian agriculture .
despite this valuable resource , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the native population receives only little of this wealth .
it is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and kidn@@ apping .
the Iranian regime refused Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ Arab@@ s systematically ref@@ uses jobs in local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government also built a variety of dem@@ ons , the waters of the Arab areas in the Persian areas where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and gh@@ om are located .
these dem@@ ons only led to destroy the devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness in the region , and the local agriculture as well as the fish and palm trees industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ ha@@ w@@ zi @-@ youth has now risen to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian director of co@@ operating , work and social welfare , told that 5 % of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who completed a job , completed elementary school , completed 55 % of a secondary school and 45 % have a university degree .
a &quot; systematic strategy ... it aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot;
Kar@@ im Doh@@ im@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights activ@@ ist in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment , and rac@@ ist of ethnic discrimination , &quot; a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of self @-@ mor@@ den among the young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i men .
Doh@@ im@@ i said that particularly the unemployment has become more serious . the reason for this is a combination of a high number in Ah@@ wa@@ z &apos;s new ethnic Per@@ sians and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the integration process :
since the func@@ tion@@ aries and institutions are not set for Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i will de@@ pri@@ ved the access to employment opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arab@@ s and forced them to earn their hab@@ itat outside of their hom@@ eland Ah@@ ra@@ z .
there are people who had to hide their pro@@ s and sur@@ name to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i and so they could not be toler@@ ated as the Arab name at the workplace , refuse the speaking of Arabic language or wearing Arabic clothing .
given the given circumstances that have to bear the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i , human rights activ@@ ist alarm before the situation explo@@ ded .
it remains to wait if the world wake up and consider it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treated and committed suicide is avoided .

&quot; why do not identi@@ fi@@ able me with the femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tional@@ ized not &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the statement dated by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website . article was an object of several discussions where many different positions came to expression .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I &apos;m not a femin@@ ist , there are many women - especially white women who describe themselves as an inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not a part of the movement .
they even reas@@ oned well @-@ thought @-@ scientific and social arguments from me why I should be a femin@@ ist and why we generally should be all femin@@ ists .
for example , that women still earn less money despite equal education as men .
that women are still under str@@ ingent observation , if it is about doing what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
that violence against women is a global epidemic .
or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women before , or later in diverse areas of life on a glass ceiling , and that discrimination based on sex may still be across the many different countries and belie@@ fs .
all of this is conscious and known .
I am convinced and I suffer twice and triple them .
I am a black wife .
and yet , if I say on r@@ ass@@ ism , on black c@@ is women , on black tran@@ si@@ den@@ te women , on black women in the L@@ GB@@ TI@@ Q community , or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I have thought about what kind of physical and verb@@ al mis@@ used , both white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists have been im@@ pover@@ ished .
but they all agree that women - all women should come together to get &quot; their voices &quot; to take up their voices and &apos; K@@ umb@@ aya , my lord &apos; to sing for equality ( some ) of the women .
but they don &apos;t want to talk about that there is in addition to sexual violence a pro@@ positi@@ onal form of r@@ amm@@ ically motiv@@ ated violence , who are exposed to black women in two times .
or about that black women and women of other eth@@ nic@@ as and origin of origin earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background often exp@@ elled as white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black sp@@ aw@@ less and women have exposed to a higher risk to suffer domestic violence and violence in the partnership , as white women .
on the other hand , I wish that all men , all men , and all men , neither skin colour have the same rights ; on the other hand , I cannot join the white woman in whose center is the white woman who refused to take account un@@ just to their thinking , which relate to both sex and skin colour of a person .
I am exhau@@ sted and will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ fem@@ inist @-@ oriented sphere that always has and countless other black women always and has turned back .
in her speech in 1851 , In her speech , &apos; Am I not a wife ? &apos; and I also refused me to just@@ ify a ide@@ ology in which the black woman is an in@@ human and mar@@ gin@@ alized being .
I join me to join the group@@ ings , which also absorb our customs and customs , to drive their eg@@ o@@ cent@@ ric program .
I will not try to close white women to overcome the importance of over@@ cutting of skin colour and gender . for some of them will continue to keep the importance of black women for the fem@@ inist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to honour them .
although the inter@@ sec@@ tional Femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different her@@ on and ren@@ dering women with white femin@@ ism , still is still the word &quot; Femin@@ ism &quot; in his name .
I draw it out to release me and quite happy to join the movement of w@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was called for my dark skin and my status as wife , instead of me for a white @-@ fem@@ inist par@@ a@@ dig@@ m that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tional@@ ity is being celebrated as a new phenomenon .
now it is important than ever before , to define black women in our own ideas and give us into the don@@ tics that are created by us for us .
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ c@@ ana wom@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves if we can defend us by our own way , in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , se@@ el@@ ical , physical and even the spiritual elements can be hon@@ ours that make up the black wife .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists immediately occur immediately after they have read these lines , please inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contra@@ di@@ ctions of fem@@ inist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures because I exist in this par@@ a@@ dig@@ ma .
I &apos;m recognized in due to my dark skin and because of my existence as a wife as part of this par@@ a@@ dig@@ m .
I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in a environment where my life is neither over@@ thrown , nor igno@@ red , nor rejected .
Pad@@ del@@ ines against pollution : the mission of a man who protect rivers in Iraq for future generations

in the framework of a content sharing agreement this article will be re@@ published here .
repeatedly , Nab@@ il Mus@@ a traveled to the last 7 years - usually with sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a special request by the region Kurdistan in Iraq . his mission aims to make people the importance of clean water bodies for current and future generations .
in this documentation of Emil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who tells us his relationship to the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution in its community .
&quot; I wanted to do something for the river , which we lost , when I was a child , told Mus@@ a .
scientists from all the country fear that the decades of the war , the construction of dust , pollution and un@@ controlled development , lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organisation Water@@ ke@@ epers - a subsidiary of Water@@ art@@ ender - that is concerned and works to protect the rivers , streams and water routes in Iraq , as well as the local municipalities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summar@@ izes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced for En@@ sia by Emil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist , produced in Er@@ bil , in Iraq .
the focus of its work lies on a little remarkable sub@@ cultures and is characterised by using co@@ oper@@ able video photography and new multi@@ media techniques that can tell their stories in their way .
Paraguay Women and their difficult struggle against violence
a group of women represents &quot; The crying women &quot; is to express their pain on women &apos;s mor@@ nings in the country and in the region to show its re@@ jection .

the following article is the ab@@ brevi@@ ated and revised version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # for@@ ili@@ ch@@ ein@@ e@@ fr@@ au@@ bin ) , who reports about the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names were changed to the protection of the people affected .
the Commissioner A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez said that she had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex@@ tras , who had become violent in comparison to her business .
since the end of their relationship was el@@ ap@@ sed time and the police said , their statement would be laid to the files , but more could not do .
when a further wife Bal@@ bu@@ ena was used because of mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment , the ak@@ ten@@ sive display of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez is nothing .
a few days later , the second woman withdrew its ad .
violence against women is difficult to break the inflation of violence against women .
if women talk at all at all , they will not receive support from the State .
in many cases , women also fin@@ anci@@ ally dependent on men that they were har@@ assed . this explains why only 20 % of all women who ad@@ mit victims of violence to be victims of violence at all .
effective 1 stro@@ kes and Statist@@ ical 2 In@@ visible abuse and a legal system that nothing sub@@ du@@ ed under the law of Paraguay : good approach , man@@ age@@ ous implem@@ ent@@ ations and statistics
it is hard to determine how many women are really har@@ assed , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , researcher for the research fellow at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aci@@ ón y E@@ ver , a social scientific research institute in Paraguay . &quot; there are different data and reports that show not even to the extent of gender equality against women in Paraguay . &quot;
the provided figures are al@@ ar@@ ming .
in 2015 , the At@@ tor@@ ney General At@@ tor@@ ney acquired 9@@ 600 ads for domestic violence . at 70 % , it went around violence against women .
86 % of ads during the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 ads because of domestic violence among the peace geri@@ es . 86 % of ads came from women .
in the ads , 40 % of women reported that they were physically disabled , 55 % of women said by mental abuse .
these statistics show not the real extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an female Minister Ana Bai@@ ard@@ i will only be shown few of these criminal off@@ ences . &quot; on any woman who will be re@@ im@@ bur@@ sed in Paraguay for mental abuse , 9 women who do not do this .
for every woman who are re@@ im@@ bur@@ sed because of physical abuse , two women who do not do this , declared at the end of 2014 .
there is no own criminal law in Paraguay , the prosecution authorities cannot be reas@@ on@@ ably documented , as many women have murdered every year from their current or former partners .
by August 2016 , journalists counted at least 12 cases of women in the country .
the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay has at least 37 cases , in which women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman died due to violence through men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a sign with the inscription : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without standing no criminal off@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; # Non @-@ Less &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Photo of Jes@@ sie Ac@@ fr@@ an Pé@@ rez . use with friendly permission . &quot; &quot; &quot;
invisible abuse and a legal system that takes nothing
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z was the fixed gir@@ l@@ friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that they called the name of all their former friends .
at the beginning , she didn &apos;t want to do that , but then , however , she should repent .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no more with Carlos ; but two years long , she bore the psych@@ ic violence against women and one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severe recogni@@ z@@ able :
I have never thought that I would have been victims of abuse .
if I have read it earlier , I always thought that only women happens to be sub@@ mitting , because they let themselves go down from violent men .
I was convinced that I would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about the abuse by Carlos Vera .
without name , she wrote contributions on Facebook in which they described his ins@@ ults and several attacks during their two @-@ year relationship , and told how he had ins@@ ulated them .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ isch , whether he ever raised the hand against them , and refused to be noted that his behavior was also a form of mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana , why they had fallen this so long by Carlos , and did not leave it earlier .
it seemed almost as they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least had a certain co bl@@ ame .
Victoria Santos , that originates from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay , to prove that her former partner was har@@ assed .
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o CRE@@ O network ( &quot; I think you &quot; ) that consists of women who are all in any way victims of abuse .
in the group , they can speak with others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do not do what many others do : they accept the statements of women .
in Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as case everything started with psychological abuse .
her we@@ al@@ thy partner finally managed to convince her that she was valuable .
then he began to beat them .
Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as ads in the authorities remained without a result and also by their relatives , she received no support .
she led a trial against their former partners , who developed into an in@@ consistent legal struggle between Paraguay and their home country , where it mainly caused money , power and influence of their former partner .
the laws of Paraguay : good approach , man@@ age@@ ous realization
&quot; in Paraguay , there are many laws that are very good , but not applied .
the display of abuse is a way of resist@@ ors and a fight against corruption in the justice , &quot; says Victoria Santos .
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in the application of laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 a bill of bill was discussed under the H@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ El@@ las ( # Für@@ y ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and movement # Ni@@ un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non @-@ Less ) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original design of the law looks like Fem@@ izi@@ d to declare and har@@ der the har@@ der than it already exists in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
thus , the legislative text was altered in some points , in order to keep the de@@ pu@@ ties for the law , that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions , which are basically prohibited in Paraguay and are punished by up to five years imprisonment .
the original bill had intended to cost the majority of the ( bureau@@ cr@@ atic and economic ) processing costs , which have to end@@ ure the victims of violence even if they just want to report and receive a secure accomodation to the state .
authentic@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legisl@@ ature does not have sufficient financial funds to offer :
in Paraguay , mist@@ re@@ ation is seen as part of inter@@ human relationships .
here a change is to take place , that violence is no longer considered a little bit .
in view of these facts , he pleaded not guilty and contributes to that the perpet@@ rators are stra@@ it@@ uted .
we have to publish so long notice until abuse does not apply more than normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the Law was adopted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . however , parts of the law had changed , but among others a passage that the partners in cases of domestic violence was called .
the opinions about the changes are heading apart .
the section concerning reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for ag@@ gres@@ sor over his victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Political Viol@@ ence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of parts of the law is considered serious blow . &quot; &quot; &quot;

independent media in Oman a year after prohibition of a newspaper continue to attacks attacks
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was closed due to the decision of the information Minister &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the homepage of the prohibited newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one year ago the Ottoman authorities closed an independent Italian newspaper Az@@ am@@ n due to its coverage of corruption in the Sult@@ ans .
You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison where he was a prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Ab@@ ri , were also arrested and placed before the court , however later .
Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 when he came to power after he had appointed his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn T@@ aim@@ ur .
since then he dressed in addition to his role as the only sult@@ an , the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces , Minister of Foreign Affairs , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Ottoman occupation of the sult@@ ans is characterized by the efforts of security forces , in particular the national fre@@ ed@@ oms , including freedom of freedom , including press , independent journalists , blo@@ gger and other activists , in@@ timi@@ date and in@@ car@@ cer@@ ate .
the authorities restri@@ cting peace and legitim@@ ate activities in the field of human rights systematically and hin@@ ts citizens , also activists , their views over the public affairs of the country such as corruption in authorities and institutions from both online and offline .
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , their closing and the imprisonment three of their editors in the last year is a hard blow for the Press Freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper in which since its inc@@ eption in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) was reported until it was forbidden by the authorities in August 2016 .
on July 28 , 2016 , security forces Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Chief of Chief of Az@@ am@@ n , published an article entitled &quot; High Pri@@ ority Parties to the Justice &quot; newspaper on July 26 , 2016 . she went to corruption in the judicial law and the mixture of high @-@ level civil servants .
in the report , government officials accused the judge of the Supreme Court of Oman under pressure , to raise a verdict in an inheritance dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n of 26 July 2016 with a report on the front page with the title : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high priority parties to bind the hands of justice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Ab@@ ri , Member of the Legal Group , was charged to the special department and upon arrival of security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS was appointed Deputy Chief Editor of You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had acted as Chief Editor by Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is .
the paper was closed on un@@ certain period after the fact that the information Minister had given the order that &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper on any way , including online , banned from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , before the Court of Mas@@ ks , the first trial took place in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Ab@@ ri .
the Tribunal sentenced the three journalists to prison terms and ordered the final closing of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j both were convicted , among others due to disorder of public order , &quot; mis@@ use of the Internet &quot; and &quot; tr@@ ench of the state &quot; was sentenced .
al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty of breach of an audience , and not found guilty .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j was sentenced to three years of pen@@ alties and fin@@ es in the amount of 3000 om@@ ic Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . in addition , a one @-@ year occupation against the two journalists was imposed .
al @-@ Ab@@ ri was sentenced to a year of prison and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) after becoming the use &quot; an information network for spreading material which could represent a danger for public order &quot; could be found guilty . &quot;
for Al @-@ Ab@@ ri , a damage deposit of 5000 om@@ ic Ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) was fixed and was released on 22 August 2016 before the Appeals Chamber .
the Appeals Chamber spoke to Al @-@ Ab@@ ri on 26 December 2016 , and sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari to six months in jail .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 , after the po@@ uring of his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ cot . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he was sentenced to his prison sentence .
in addition , the Court of Appeal dismissed the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
in spite of the decision of the court , Az@@ am@@ n again , the newspaper sees after attacks by the Iranian government .
on January 8 , the Minister of Information dismissed a statement with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information was personally signed by the Minister of Information , in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and presented himself another time against the decision of the Appeals Court to publish the newspaper &apos;s publication .
the last closing of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which in Oman at least the freedom of press was wounded .
for further violations , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ at@@ ine and the exercise of pressure on al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country , to carry out its operation .
due to the continuous closing of Az@@ am@@ n and the imprisonment of journalists Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ ic authorities are still not ready to prepare an extensive violation of the Press Freedom .
the Golf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the om@@ ic authorities to :
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ conditi@@ onally free ;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understanding
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ er 2016 in Zambia , picture will take place with his understanding of understanding
medical research in Africa is only rare or not mentioned in the media . this is a growing range , which addresses one of the most ur@@ gent requirements of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research on site : a lack of medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the special medical need on the African continent .
ill@@ nesses such as AIDS , tuber@@ culosis and malaria have more serious effects in the p@@ oo@@ rest countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment for the research of these diseases caused by pharmaceutical markets are a great problem .
secon@@ dly , research , which is carried out by African scientists , is helping to develop its own research capacity in Africa . a major role of science and technology can only be eligible for the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ ors is director of the Central Committee on the Centre for Expl@@ oration disorders in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just when the AIDS epidemic had the first serious impact on the national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Louis@@ iana , later in Indiana .
as a Post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he resear@@ ched the HIV virus , before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ ic health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. Warri@@ ors discussed about the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understanding of media on these research .
( Dis@@ claim@@ er : Dr. Warri@@ ors says as a private people ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research issue ?
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ er RW : at the moment the focus of my work on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ ic national program for anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I just launch a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ o@@ gens .
g@@ v : what are your opinion according to the important recent science topics in your country and general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there are no basic research here . we only rely on solutions that have been developed differently .
this must change , otherwise we will always stay the receiver instead of yourself .
solutions that we get are often usable in our area , and sometimes it is impossible to use it here .
g@@ v : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult it is to find appropriate scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are funded differently well .
it is difficult to find people who want to return or go here , because financing and development chances are better in other countries .
g@@ v : how is the research infrastructure ?
which obstacles are there in your routine research work which you didn &apos;t have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure is not equal to standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
g@@ v : how is the opinion of public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would propose that critical thinking and scientific methods are taught in schools to improve the situation .
g@@ v : how big is your opinion according to the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on , and how can we support development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I &apos;ve seen great students of all age groups .
there is demand for special scientific training , beginning at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , research of the space , healthcare ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ ag@@ ious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it .
g@@ v : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as scientists in Africa over Western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : often , it is the limited speed to do things , and the hard access to scientific expertise that would display here .
the system that magazines are only accessible against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limited the amount of available information and speed of research .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the United States to India : how &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seed producers change global food production
this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky appeared initially on the En@@ si@@ a.com website , a magazine presenting on solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank M@@ orton has been educ@@ ated in the United States since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties , like an example out@@ red@@ ness , the first plant which has been cultivated by NASA ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts in space and has devoured .
almost 20 years of mort@@ ons , mort@@ ons , work only through its own in@@ dem@@ nity , and the question as many sal@@ aries , he can have set limits .
but in the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noticed that more sal@@ ads were patented and that he could not be able to resol@@ ve them .
the patents are not only for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special Rot@@ or or Green @-@ Green leaves .
over the past few years more such patents have been applied to more plants such as grain or cart@@ ons . due to this trends , plant bre@@ eders , environ@@ ment@@ ers and experts for food safety ensure the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia of ancient tradition , M@@ orton still dies a salad , however , he needs longer than ever since his work is becoming more toler@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is , than in a river a b@@ oul@@ ders lies around whom I must make f@@ add@@ ling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we must now do that , but it is a breaking with the breeding tradition , &quot; says he . &quot; I think this patents have to go to Sal@@ ads .
and if they stand before the court , there is no one more new sal@@ ads , because all characteristics are already patented . &quot; he makes it as good as possible and try to figure out those characteristics that he would like .
however , it is very careful and ende@@ av@@ oured to use no material that is protected as intellectual property .
he also joined a movement that is always bigger in the USA and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; trains ) .
ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have been cultivated and eaten red tube sal@@ ads in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station . there it has been tested as plants can be cultivated in space .

it &apos;s no co@@ incidence that this name sounds rather than the movement would come from the IT area and not from the range of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( Initiative for &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds ) can be inspired by the move for free &quot; Open Source &quot; Software which provide alternatives to protected by copyright software .
it was founded in order to ensure that some plant species and gen@@ ders are not being protected as intellectual property and can be used for plant bre@@ eders .
as part of the initiative , briefly Oss@@ i , US bre@@ eders could agree that others can use them with them cultivated by them .
this does not mean that they do not continue to make business with their seed , and can sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ eders allow for others to cross their seed , to cross their own varieties , and it is not immediately sufficient - two aspects which are prohibited by many plants .
dozens of bre@@ eders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
greater prospects for prospects
for emer@@ gen@@ cies from the University of Wisconsin @-@ Madison and Oss@@ i member , Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control of seed and the possibility of breeding new plants , both for food security and environmental protection .
seeds plays a role in greater coll@@ ateral such as biodiversity , rights of pe@@ as@@ ants , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would try to use the latter not or just little , by breeding seed with natural resistance .
the Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphas@@ ises that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement do not work with genet@@ ically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , cor@@ n , genet@@ ically modified or not , from organic agriculture , or does not need to buy food products in the global agricultural industry , whose youngest examples are offered to buy food markets , such as it is offered on pe@@ as@@ markets , should also know that this species is bred and threatened as such vegetables .
nutrition so@@ vereign without seed integrity is not possible . &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative under@@ take to provide other their seeds at their disposal . thus , in contrast , their intention is to be patented in contrast , seeds and plant features .
photo from Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
Oss@@ i supp@@ orter argu@@ ed that the future of food supply is end@@ anger@@ ed because the available gene pool due to the increasingly numerous Intel@@ lec@@ tual Property Rights on plant material , which is therefore always restricted to un@@ ce@@ asing .
Claire Lu@@ by , Executive Director of Oss@@ i , has worked in her PhD thesis with genetic variation on carrots and their availability . she found out that approximately one @-@ third of all cart@@ ograph@@ ies are protected as intellectual property , making it suitable for plant bre@@ eders either not or less is usable .
there is still such estimates for other plants , but experts such as Lu@@ by believe that mass@@ ac@@ tic plants are patented as wheat in still greater style as wheat or carrots .
a Question of Vis@@ ibility
plants are usually bred that they have targeted features - of such that their taste or its color improves up to such , due to them th@@ ri@@ ve in certain environments such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ eders through increasingly more patents . however , genetic diversity is currently necessary than ever before , since the changed conditions are worse by climate change much worse .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to spokes@@ person Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to believes that genetic diversity is generally important and also decisive for Mon@@ san@@ tos activities . with a total of four gen@@ banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Agricultural Ministry of the United States , the company will use the preservation of genetic diversity .
however , she contra@@ di@@ ct that intellectual property tries to promote other bre@@ eders since &quot; patents and the protection of plant vari@@ ets innovations . &quot; a patent is basically adopted as soon as the patent expi@@ res .
often these instructions help others to come with another method of the same result .
such a protection is not able to in@@ hib@@ its innovations , but promotes positive material and know @-@ how to public . &quot;
M@@ orton requires different innovations to wait for another 20 years until a patent begins , but certainly no innovations .
and if you have to wait for such a long time , they have been adapted to plants that have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you would have lost the struggle .
the major argument for M@@ orton , however , that genetic resources have always been a general good and continue to remain : &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders have neither the time still the money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ et@@ ely inc@@ en@@ tives are not attractive for us .
we want to make farmers their work .
this is it possible to write us , and it &apos;s impossible to use us if we do not continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot;
in all , M@@ orton does not distur@@ b the concept to patented the plant features : &quot; we do not really use the features itself .
plants form them themselves and as bre@@ eders , we finally have no idea how the plants do it .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant care in the US state of Oregon and Oss@@ i member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; who is breeding , breeding his own values in them .
those who believes in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , are necessary to produce her@@ bic@@ ide her@@ bic@@ ide which are cultivated in its varieties in agriculture in its varieties .
my concept is perfect . &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized enterprises ( such that move to international markets , but smaller than for example Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , even without being able to survive - either re@@ ject the pat@@ enting or they keep it for too expensive and therefore not worth it or both is the case .
the independent plant bre@@ eders Frank M@@ orton looks at his breeding garden Sal@@ ate .
photo by Karen M@@ orton .
M@@ orton is also the view that bre@@ eders would be innovative by the Av@@ oid of plant patent : &quot; it looks like that , as I can produce new effort to produce new releases , stronger than companies .
I need to get new material for my catalog because I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years ago , &quot; says he . &quot; with a patent one is protected for 20 years before competition , with what makes it very nice easy to make . &quot; worldwide reson@@ ance
although the United States seem to be a leader in the &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding , but the concept itself rises quickly around the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) describes itself as professional organisation in the area of resources , an &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seed @-@ plant based on farmers and helps them develop new varieties that meet particular requirements .
it also supports it to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds and to sell your own .
the German Organisation Agreement operates at an &quot; open @-@ source &quot; license which ultimately became a formal and legally binding form of Oss@@ i &apos;s obligation for bre@@ eders in the European Union .
( regulations for breeding differ from the country to country , as well as the Oss@@ i obligation not simply can be taken one into one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally cultivated plants should not be patented . thus it speaks for the current practice of the European Patent Office that allowed patents to conven@@ tionally cultivated plants .
however , there is no law ; now it is on the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization H@@ iv@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , on farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , non @-@ governmental organizations and seed companies from all East Africa to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the global trend towards the pat@@ ent@@ ability of seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for H@@ iv@@ os &apos; program for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems that the organization currently should establish a worldwide alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , which should be scheduled for scheduled next year .
a merger from environmental protection and development groups ( including H@@ iv@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development organisation US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of the food - a ban and help companies such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - represents a report that farmers need to be able to exchange and improve the seed policy , so that a stable supply can be ensured by food .
in the report , the importance of a varied , local supply with seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection between the Lu@@ i of Oss@@ i hopes it hopes to realize him soon more people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movement for regional and ecological food has always counted , where and how little is cultivated , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to clear the people that more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the newest goals of the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
to un@@ lock the Egyptian authorities in the internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ ni@@ sts .
at the weekend of 0@@ 5th August the Egyptian government filed the website of the &quot; Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ H@@ RI ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world .
in August , the network published an opinion on Facebook in which it critic@@ ised the Egyptian authorities for this step and continued to continue efforts and efforts for human rights in the region .
the &quot; Network for Human Rights Information For@@ ks in spite of this attack and the Constitution , who wants to defend this goal in this part of the world to allow freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , so it was never so important as now . AN@@ H@@ RI , it was never so important as now . AN@@ H@@ RI , it was never so important to overcome them to overcome the lock and not re@@ ad@@ mit . we hope to meet our task .
AN@@ H@@ RI is regarded as the first cen@@ sored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities blocked more than two months 21 websites , such as the independent news page MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , arab@@ ic @-@ ling@@ ual issue of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Al Jaz@@ e@@ era &quot; network of con@@ genital &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;

besides AN@@ H@@ RI , there &apos;s no access in Egypt &apos;s blog and human rights ab@@ uses Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for spreading column and articles that he writes in Egypt not accessible websites and media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the blog , whom he set up to circum@@ vent the Egyptian government to avoid the goal of an attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
blo@@ gger who has been native to the Zi@@ adas blog , however , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent almost 500 days in captivity , after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he participated in the student &apos;s police , and performed a video about the police physical violence against two students .
his article are mainly turning around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook review , Zi@@ ada donated to the blocking of the government and refle@@ cting what this means for him :
those , blo@@ gs to un@@ lock is very old , but has priority to me in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi . and even if the blocking of blo@@ gs may not be meaning@@ ful for the world , it is it for two reasons for me :
1 ) It succeeded to give me the feeling of a siege to mediate , an arrest , an alleged murder , pre@@ charge at the National Security Council , the blocking of blo@@ gs , and any other website , for which I worked .
2 ) You have proven that I wrote not in vain . in other words , my words have influence , if only one small audience .
I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to the post of articles to get the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship .
now , after they have blocked him , and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the mud go the way up to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities closed from 24 May to 06 August 133 pages . this gave technical tests into the networks of various Internet Service Provider ( ISP ) , including orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and Et@@ an .
AF@@ TE also documented the blocking of providers that was possible through the implementation of Internet en@@ c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in their research :
on Monday the 12th of June we noticed how the wave of websites that V@@ P@@ N@@ s appeared .
such practice indicates the intention of government to block content to block content and might have access to the Egyptian users .
in addition , the situation will be wor@@ sen@@ ed that the c@@ ens@@ er decisions can be met behind closed doors , thus reducing the Egyptian population does not have legal basis to advance against this actions .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and whom will it be next to attack ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants fight .

day for day report newspapers in Brazil with popular head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcards .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot at school &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every second day a police officer murdered in Rio de Janeiro &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Di@@ iev@@ es har@@ ps 8500 soldiers of the army , Marine and Air Baltic to Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in an an@@ ted financial situation , the Viol@@ ence 2017 in Rio reached the highest stand for 10 years .
the United Nations &apos;s Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation called the United Nations to access the United Nations .
reports such as these are all daily and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the detailed report on violence in Rio known newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 16 August is not normal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which she announced to set a new section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city will now be published there .
the moti@@ fs for their decision declared the newspaper so :
extra will continue to report about crimes reported in any major city on the world as murder , rob@@ b , sexual crimes , etc . everything that happens from the civil standard , and what only happens in Rio , will be published in the heading &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : that &apos;s not normal !
this is the only alternative , that we may not exclu@@ de our eyes in front of the grave .
in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oct@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ ede@@ an , the editor of the newspaper , said that this decision is not a reason for pride , but rather a sign of failure to be :
extra is probably the only newspaper across the world with a war bar@@ k in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize the war .
in the same video a journalist announced that according to the details of the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro , 8@@ 43 territories there are responsible for criminal organizations .
in the editorial article the newspaper writes :
we are aware that a war dis@@ course , when it is dist@@ orted to be used , Gr@@ aus@@ ages of the police , which just sho@@ ots and then questions to dec@@ or .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners .
does the name &quot; war &quot; f@@ ails to get more than it ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Bras@@ il argu@@ ed the journalist in Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , to describe violence as &quot; war . &quot; this is their opinion according to a just@@ ification of failed security policy through the media and could make it more difficult , Respon@@ sible for the police .
this is no war .
this is the result of corruption and worse planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of the military interest rates in Rio itself - in combination with in@@ sufficient investments in personnel , en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment , and an historical and self @-@ neg@@ lec@@ ting of public service .
reminder : the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than its capital .

according to Cec@@ í@@ lia , Rio de Janeiro is false : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil , according to statistics from 2015 , are located in the north and north east of the country . these are the most recent data available .
no such cities is in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
if we watch the Mor@@ dr@@ ates in the state , Rio is on No.@@ 16 , &quot; writes her .
extra belongs to the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company of South America , emphas@@ ised as Cec@@ í@@ lia , since years the State policy of the State .
to these safety measures , the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia , fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one from the state of Rio in 2003 , was one of the police unit whose goal is to conquer a Fav@@ ela by deployment and a unit permanently .
at the beginning , this actually led to a decrease in for@@ ci@@ ble deaths . for some years , the U@@ PP could actually protect about Sch@@ ic@@ ans and repression against the poor congregations , who actually should protect the ne@@ ug@@ ely police unit , increasingly on f@@ uss .
on his Facebook page , the journalist João Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux made from an article published in 2010 , in which he declares , why the violence in Rio did not correspond to the criteria of &quot; Civil War &quot; by the Geneva Convention .
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the location in Rio is considered serious consequences for people to themselves .
for this demands the state to use funds and ways which are typical for war . in addition , the entry into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; which is a sharp point in the countryside , and for the object for &quot; coll@@ ateral damages &quot; and &quot; sp@@ elled spher@@ es . &quot;
war or her , fact is that the inhabitants of the Fav@@ el@@ as continues to suffer in Rio .
one week it is now that the police seized the mountain with the Fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ emen .
in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : an or@@ derer died as a result of shots who had fired the police from a helicopter .

many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition are based on the basis of investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre committed by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , the areas controlled by the reb@@ els have been con@@ founded outside Damascus under siege of siege , which led to the local authority or check@@ points by the tunnel and control points .
by the many long block@@ ade , traditional food supplies such as meat become in@@ accessible for large parts of the population .
as counter@@ claim a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and academ@@ ics , the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , as they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ co and run the project together with the NGO Al No@@ ala .

at the time of the Constitution , it will have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 € , but will continue until Monday , the 4th of September 2017 .
the initiative is applied to generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
due to the fuel scar@@ city , locally produced fuel is used in plastic to supply generators with the necessary energy .
Dr. L@@ eil@@ a said Global Vo@@ ices that they started with the &quot; production from the regions of the fung@@ us &quot; before they over@@ looked their quality and are whether they are suitable for consumption .
then they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub . when they succeeded , they used a bigger tub . and so on .
now they have created a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms everywhere in East Gh@@ out@@ a .
Dr. L@@ eil@@ a declared that it is part of a greater movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the mushroom breeding of various reasons : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breaking the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
provision of a new food source on the market .
spread of a culture of self supply by eating essence ( such as paper , tea , coffee set , cardboard , etc ) to the extraction of new food .
creation of new jobs , especially for women who work home .
creation of new jobs for people with disabilities , which are tied to her home .
he said , &quot; We hope to spread this idea in the whole world , so that our success and our fight against hunger and the siege is visible .

in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , roads and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
on Sunday they did this no@@ where : there are dozens of reports from open streets that were surrounded by fire .
in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy could happen again as in June , because the streets were blocked too late . &quot;
in addition , construction permits will take place in Ö@@ r@@ t@@ ins with a high Bran@@ dr@@ is@@ iko .
a major suggest@@ ion to the Wal@@ dre@@ form , which had brought the government to severe fires in 2003 and 2005 , was donated by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obst@@ acle for investments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government carried out a loos@@ ening of the law , which allowed the rule over funds to protect it - that was an open back@@ door , so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leads João Sor@@ val on the same article in the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the journey from Afghanistan to successful entrepren@@ eurs

in a night in the autumn of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began through the Taliban .
two years ago , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ jah@@ ed@@ in group , which had defeated the short @-@ lasting pro @-@ Soviet government . so Afghanistan became a country of terror and desp@@ air .
just at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ ha@@ zn@@ i at the last time with his family together with dinner .
even if his mother then did not say then , she knew that she would not see her son much longer - maybe even more .
the boy should break the boy in the morning .
his un@@ cle would pick him up and bring him to the locks .

cc @-@ 2.0
Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the Party of Haz@@ ara dominant party He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat was just murdered by Taliban , and many Haz@@ ara felt suddenly protection .
the Taliban kick@@ ed closer and closer to the haz@@ ard @-@ known Taliban .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
some days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan .
in a few years he worked in a coh@@ ab@@ ru@@ be . the work was heavily and made him sick .
then he took this , which was left of his small wages , and went into Iran . once again he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and towing sacks with mort@@ ars , which were heavier than himself to earn his living .
back then , as today , the lives of Afghan refugees in Iran was min@@ ted by mis@@ ery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; said A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the building site , which we worked on .
there were no services there and no heating . we put nylon in front of the open window , that we do not cancel the night at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran , and made ready for travel to Europe .
in the dangerous crossing on the sea , he suffered ship@@ wreck and stran@@ ded on a small , inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities had rejected his asylum request , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
a few days was A@@ shar@@ af homeless , running alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed twice on the day of food to help needy families .
it is true that Italy is due to relatively high growth rates , a kind second chance for expired asylum seek@@ ers . however , it is true that the conditions of asylum seek@@ ers in the country are cat@@ astroph@@ ic .
the Human Rights organisation Al@@ liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes the system &quot; suff@@ ers from a general lack of transparency .
the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers is housed in the more than 3000 &quot; special recording centres . &quot; this is an impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared staff . &quot;
according to Italian Law , asylum seek@@ ers can be allocated to a recording center if they have officially granted a request for asylum - which can still go for months after the registration of the asylum request .
until then , people who have no money for an apartment , either drawn to the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so it came to A@@ shar@@ af .
but his un@@ cont@@ ingent of life helped A@@ shar@@ af who soon release them out of these conditions .
after spending several years in the construction industry several years , A@@ shar@@ af made his whole exploration in the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
this was so good that he still opened a second hostel for a while and a snap@@ shot .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ at@@ is success story is now the theme of the &quot; handic@@ apped Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( german : &quot; behind the Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director A@@ min Wah@@ id@@ i .
the film received the Venice City Award in 2017 , which has been awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepren@@ eurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Italian - are very difficult .
a lot of bureau@@ cracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to un@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afghanistan live in Italy .
for many of them the country is a transition solution on the way to other European countries .
over the past few years , some of Afghanistan produced companies , including cutting , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afghan restaurants were even blessed in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ m@@ adi had the idea about his restaurant Oriental Experience in which the wa@@ iter and the kitchen staff were mainly refugees from various parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells you by the various Afghan National Bank , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their journey to Italy .
the af@@ gh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the p@@ izzeria Cab@@ ul@@ og@@ na in Bologna and a S@@ ush@@ i restaurant in Rome also found Afghanistan .
however , A@@ shar@@ af@@ s goals are rich , however , far beyond the Italian gastronom@@ y industry and retail , and aim to go back to the country , which he had to forced dis@@ rup@@ ted as teen@@ ager .
&quot; where a risk is , even possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan .
I have never forget my land , and I can &apos;t live happy if I know that my people suffer .
I have a project for farmers from the p@@ oo@@ rest provinces of the country , especially for women .
they represent half of the society and have to get the same possibilities as all others . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af has also plans to learn plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul , where the packaging and preserv@@ atives could also learn . &quot; thus , they can sell their seri@@ ousness on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says .
the development of successful entrepren@@ eurs was a journey through un@@ certainty and doubt but at the end stand stability and prosper@@ ity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey itself . now he would like to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .
