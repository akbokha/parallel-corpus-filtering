<seg id="1">Although I visited the United States since 2012 at least once a year, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love to America is exceptionally big.</seg>
<seg id="4">As many of my generation, I grew up with American films, played with American music and operated by American authors.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had a significant profound effect on me that I became mainly because of an American film journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old I saw the great Denzel Washington like he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Letter, a fearless reporter, who had covered the murderous conspiracy of a oil-Magnum to occupy the Supreme Court with judges who had its interest to his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">Free to Method One, "I was as if that is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that is what I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the USA had only intensified.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country where I have ever lived, whose variety is so welcoming that you are always one who you are and it is easy acceptance in a community of equal people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very shear love story about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">A lot was written about the xenophobia and the racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most unusual aspect of his ascension is to me as he walks with its narrow face.</seg>
<seg id="15">He doesn't keep his mind behind the mountain as you say so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thought, like a former colleague, express his express his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afroamerand women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people responded to his statements and approved in pairs for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes, who won the Republican Presidential elections, was the highest number one ever recorded by the party.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support these bigs per person, asked me?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not bring Trump and his voters not to be in line with the people I learned during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">As for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program that takes people from around the world, a deep stunning man with whom I could talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also Trumps did not agree with the fact that Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the "Cincinnati Inquirer," agreed.</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to view the "Phoenix Suns" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps Intoleranz also stands in contrast to generosity, which I struggled with Sandy Bahr, who struggles to the environment for her life, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like their son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She still fits them to the engagement of Kristi Kappes, which helped me with a lot of patience and suffering from my colleagues to get to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wiser council helped me much in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those who have been displaced my love to America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump gets trump to the nominated republican Presidential candidates, they offer to me a hold, and the counterpart of its limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016, over 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of its contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The struggles with the idea that people had voted for Trump, because they were either given its racism and fanaticism, because they were ready to overlook these things, broke out for me almost the heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to describe the trump voters as an Rassists.</seg>
<seg id="34">The people arrange themselves, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficially and respectless and indicates inability to understand those who act in another way and act.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that this electors have voted to have voted for drump, because they want to gain control of a country that has disappointed it?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they wanted to say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, you can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commented on the cruel decision to raise a man who can look down with contempt on those who look like it.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "this" "" "Whitelash" "" "(Ed.): as much as" rejection of the white against all other ethnicity; "" "" wording made of white in memory of the White and whiplash, what is so much means like a slit trauma), as did the great Van Jones named that America did so great. "" "</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions people around the world estimate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background you can always have, America means any welcome.</seg>
<seg id="43">Because this country chose to be twice the son of a Kenyan twice the son of a Kenianity, whose story says himself, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">However, with the Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of white America this promise, saying: to Hell with many times, religious freedom and the whole term of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the Americas after 9 / 11 the white man is back on the ruder, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">In all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">At a demonstration for Hillary Clinton Mr. Khan had a word change with the human being.</seg>
<seg id="48">Donald Trump, my son, captain Humayun Kahn had a place in your America? "asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd responded with a loud voice no! "</seg>
<seg id="50">"do Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" brushed the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered them.</seg>
<seg id="54">Have Afro Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they called her and their voices were a loud voice.</seg>
<seg id="56">"if anyone who doesn't like to have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received an inconsistance and loud "NO"!</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan closed with the words: "thanks be to Mr. Trump, isn't it your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land, for which his son was fallen, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is Trumps country, saying the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people that look like Mr. Khan, could no place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaketh me my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero municipality in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the Paraguayan city of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music that is played in both places, not only the life of the children has changed, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill, only 16 kilometres south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city that is popular among tourists is very popular - but worlds away from the nearby precolonial Ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For some years now the La Banda de Música (Musikbande) has now been playing in the community, one of children and adults, existing symphony orchestra, which has been an opportunity to overcome poverty with their musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest to the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The commune, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drugs abuse and the bankers.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after an accidental meeting with a French pilots, who started a musical project, and the youth thus offered a rare hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take up their obligations towards the music group, the local press release Noticias Oaxaca NVI writes:</seg>
<seg id="79">Once they come from the school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to keep their huge passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come and play with shiny eyes and play in the deceit they learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, Bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from Waste</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village which is practically located on the largest garbage dump of Asunción in the capital city - on instruments which are made of recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with recovered instruments which consist of local solid waste materials, manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura where the recycling started under the baton of Favio Chávez to transform the parts of the waste in instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments mentioned violinist, violas, Celli, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion which were all produced from the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguan and Latin American music and music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez remembers a local digitiologist and musicians of the children of Cateura, at the early time:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no room for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place to contact the parents in the garbage, The children did not know any music and it was very difficult to contact their parents, because many of them do not live with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">That changed when Favio was shown something that he had never seen before: a trash made of waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a whole orchestra that plays on instruments from recovered material and is called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary Names "Landscape Harmonic" (Harmonic refuse dump) shows the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates about one billion tonnes of rubbish each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who are with him and of him are the poorest, such as people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landscape Harmonic follows the orchestra with his inspiring spectacle of trash-zu-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">Orchestra has played his music even before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These Eastern African countries show how technology and teamwork can tackle the illegal fishing industry</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that fighting wild illegal fishing industry.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that provides targeted solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-release occurs during an agreement with global Voices for common use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">At that time, in West Africa, it was already known that this ship had been operated in librate waters of illegal fishing before it was looking forward to the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The Eastern African countries were correspondingly rising and inclined to be a little bit inclined by the criminals of this species to its coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Compores, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilized rapidly against the ship. they refused to share one of their harbours and refused to share a fishing boat.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "the Premier was surrounded by countries that you simply have refused to" "" "recalls the Kiilu, a senior employee of the Kenyan fisheries authority. it is part of a team that discovered the ship of stone and persecuted." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was driven out from the waters of the region: it was not able to catch the fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Finally, it was forced to pay USD 2 million to Liberia, because of pillaging the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, the criminal practices and resources protects and was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO stop illegitimate Fishing (Illegal Fisheries).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are alongside Somalia and Madagascar the six countries, who then expelled the Premier out of their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "we have eight countries, who are ballored and are working together. they change information and stand on each other with where it goes to illegal fishing" "", "says Tony Long, Head of Pew Charian Trusts project Ending illegally. this project offers FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is regulated by definition: what is caught, is hidden, so that illegal fishing is a main cause of overfishing regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">A deliberation of existing laws, by which certain habitats and types are to be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystems will harm a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">However, during actions against the illegal fishing industry, the actions were obstructed by bureaucratic hurdles, and even by the snow-bureaucracy, the actions occurred today in real time, with traceable on FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, the individual countries can exchange with each other, for example, to suspect licate licences, news to suspect activities or details, which can be noticed at an port inspections.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive if they move on the open sea, with satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows to mark the authorities to describe vessels that are fishing in forbidden areas - such as suspected drivers discover - such that a ship will show its caught fish on the road to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">In ideals such investigations show whether the participating ships have a fishing licence where they were on the way and possibly even if they have a criminal law.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing can be found on the basis of these information then that the ships can not be sold in their harbours. what means that the ships can not be sold their charge, and that they could even be forced to the numbers of penalties, as in the fall of the Premier.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "then there are significant financial losses for the owner, meaning that the illegal fishing catch is financially no longer worthwhile." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that's what we want to reach, "says Per Erik Bergh, leader director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm which places the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supported FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed Front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to win an estimated 20 million USD to lost sales, which lose eight members of the network HISH-i every year due to illegal fishermen who penetrating the waters into East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing companies that attracts since the region's commercial fish catch. among these also iillegitimate fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Among others, actions are counted as the sail under the false flag, feit licpapers, indication of phakienenames, fishing-protected species and the fish in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "" "" "you use the lack of international cooperation and make the weakness of a non-qualified control system" "", "says Long." "" "a ship was illegal and a country could say 'You must not run my port." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Come to me'. "and exactly this legale Schlupfl tries to close FISH-i now.</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception FISH-i was involved in more than 30 investigations of suspects.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has revealed a criminal networks, which had counterfake licences in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities, and found its winged ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its collaboration with INTERPOL, the International Authority to combat crimes, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing beyond large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "some of our investigations show us quite far into the networks of organizational crime" "", "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">It builds a system, the FISH-i is to help exporting ships ever precise.</seg>

<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is always developed further, helps to split the illegal ships to hide themselves.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "the Illegal Fischer use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position." "" "says Duncan Copeland, Chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, a NRO which also offers with fisheries and FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships switch for example its automatic identification systems, where they can no longer be controlled by satellite.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland helps to build a system that links different information. there is to help FISH-i help to find criminating ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team of African nations actually can influence influence on the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the platform Global Fishing Watch with Google and the Oceana Sea Protection Organization: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed by means of each individual traceable shipments worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "go to the neighbors to get a better image of it, who's what does," "" "says he." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources to the investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">We should do this in global level. "Pew Charly Trusts has a similar project to run on which a global system allows persecution of ships.</seg>
<seg id="142">There is signs that FISH-i's activities are not only crime novels, but they also cries off.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that had previously been exploited without a license and hardly any consequences with consequences, we know that they will be observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i have now gained a 33% increase in fisheries, since then fishing boats more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia helped to split Greko 1, the inspectors found there on board locks, whose use is prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">Other countries have also noted these successes. "the effect is so strong that we now also have other countries," says Kiilu. "we have become an study project." in West Africa, we will disappear several hundred million dollars annually through illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="148">In 2015, six countries have joined together, to the so-called West Africa Task Force. they also fight against illegal fishing, after exactly the same model as FISH-i. "With safety, the aim is to create even more such initiatives and structures in other regions," says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's most recent member states saw his first big triumph: in October, there was Greko 1, a ship used under the false flag. and not only the ship was used without a license and have been used tow networks, which are now prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="150">The ship was still reserved in forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia. "with the notice of measure against Greko 1 we set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fish catch," says Bergh.</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i, this is another success of many. and at the same time the proof that such a special, collaborative work to protect the oceans actually works in the entire world.

<seg id="163">As part of the social, political and economic crisis, the inflation rate is to be found in the highest part of the world (the inflation rate is estimated to be 500% on the annual financial statements) and in which a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine has been considered the only way to conquer their institutional structures and close a new government alliance.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview of Alejo Gómez with Luis Quijano, the origin of the origin was published on August 23, 2016 at Día a Día, an Argentine news page.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father, the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentine city Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As an adult man, Quijano said in the context of the great La Perla-Ribera trial in the province of Córdoba, against his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">The trial which ended on 24 August 2016 were committed to crimes committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano has not been sought out his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting with the office, same name as his father can carry up to the brutal military permissions in the prison La Perla, which he observed at the age of 15 he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">He kept the family's secret for 34 years.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation then I believed that was in order.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret magician.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years you don't notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">I could not know that my father was a thief, folky and robbers.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was Gendanerieer. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a period of state terrorism, his father was Deputy Commander of the Intelligence Division 141 in prison La Perla.</seg>

<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos son, a man who had experienced the extent of atrocities in the course of the years, which he had experienced as a boy, and who testified before a Federal Court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows what great power has a parent over his child, and as this child chose a way to redemption.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father began to participate in the military base, I often went with us to the sports hall. there, I had rounded off with a boy, the martial arts.</seg>
<seg id="217">All they called him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father of him, and a few days later he showed me a black-white photo and asked me to identify my friend.</seg>
<seg id="219">He said:</seg>

<seg id="230">My father took me four times after La Perla, all in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">During the first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me the second time, he commanded me to go out. he led me to a barracks, in the cars, furniture, television, fridges - simply all possible - stood.</seg>
<seg id="233">All of it was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a small blanket in a blanket, and ordered me to carry it into the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a large clumsy silver.</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day, I went to the other end of the Baracke, where the stolen objects were turned and undered me with a juniper.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he interpreted in an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">There the prisoners were tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I went in and saw a song where people were tortured.</seg>
<seg id="239">She looked like a field-bed and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they paved the one end of a cable. the other end was fastened at the body of the person who had just taken there.</seg>

<seg id="250">He spoke with "Chubi" Lopez (Jose López, an civilians who was also accused in the trial) and I used the opportunity to take a look at La Cuadra.</seg>
<seg id="251">In the background I saw a series of mattresses, which were naked people with the face down - all were in hands and feet.</seg>
<seg id="252">Close to the input, people remain silent on the mattresses.</seg>
<seg id="253">When my father noticed that I saw a prisoner, he said, "Why do you like this?"</seg>
<seg id="254">I met "Why have you brought me?"</seg>
<seg id="255">I knew that these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">They were thrown into a pit and killed by soldiers.</seg>

<seg id="264">Here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the trial.</seg>
<seg id="265">When they survived torture, the prisoners were thrown into the cubora, until the arrangement of the above came to be transferred.</seg>

<seg id="275">I have always asked how my father, the leader of security forces, could perform in this vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="276">I just don't understand.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was a officer in the Gendarmerie and I would never forget to enter into a house and steal everything in it.</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my father could do it.</seg>

<seg id="280">You are not a crime?</seg>

<seg id="287">We were not poor, but he still brought clothes with home.</seg>
<seg id="288">At that time, the defence accused me to have been a prisoner with this crime. I said, no problem, they can lay down with me what they wanted.</seg>

<seg id="348">On a sign the Japanese word (both enrolmentsa), the "older drivers" means, perhaps - perhaps also with a big back thanks & # 8212; as "fearful drivers" translated.</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads in the entrance area and building itself from 1 to 20 September.</seg>
<seg id="350">Adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Levine, which was dealt with in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The error was translator Julian Holmes, a resident Kyotos, retired. it was also that the local newspapers made a attentive.</seg>
<seg id="352">The daily Kyoto Shimbun was published in Kyoto:</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could it come to such a English translation?</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that nobody has read the translation.</seg>
<seg id="355">This is an insult of elderly people and an international city like Kyoto, "said Holmes"</seg>
<seg id="356">"" "the defective English translation was initially removed." "" "the designation" "" "(German:" "" "fearful drivers" "" ") was later replaced by the appropriate name, if the grammatical" "" "Elder drivers" "" "(German:" "" "older drivers" "" ") was replaced." ""</seg>
<seg id="357">The police in the Kyoto Prefecture has changed for translation errors. furthermore it declared that the error was already contained in the text that they had been reviewed by the translator, and that the translation was not tested for their accuracy before it was released.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "sorry that older people felt by the inadequate correction (the translation) our part," "" "said the police." ""</seg>

<seg id="361">The word "fearful" was denounces as an adequate description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of elderly people who are involved in accidents are being involved, but definitely concern for worries.</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto Prefecture, for example, 1,941 were caused by senior citizens in 2005. this equates to a percentage of 10%.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, senior citizens created 1.803 from a total of 11,850 accidents.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translators are diverse.</seg>
<seg id="377">You need two important skills: passive voice knowledge to understand the output text and active voice knowledge to transfer him to the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires reminders of the target language - something that is in native language. in general, the conviction is that translators should be in the target language - not in the language language - native language.</seg>
<seg id="379">For instance, a French native language should translate from English to French - not from the French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies employ no staff with English as a native language that could make translations into English. this may lack of understanding, cost reasons, or the relatively small number of English speakers that can learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that have no foreign employees think, translations can still be firmation. then the Japanese staff whose English knowledge is the best to be translators - no matter how good or bad his language knowledge really are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machined translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The vered and enigmatic phrases that are created by machelle translations, show that this technology can still replace no human translator. this applies to some languages quite particularly.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strange English phrases in Japan, including the crispy prints, often used T-shirts or pockets are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo of Flickr users Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors like jewelry still acceptable or at least harmless. but of large enterprises or from the government who have funds to ensure higher standards, one can expect more carefully.</seg>
<seg id="389">The city of Kyoto uses a serious source of their translations in the future.</seg>

<seg id="391">Main page of the portal "Naval con Libertad" (free surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto PRENSA y Sociedad, Institute of Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, April 7, the Venezuelan internet used that they had no access to the online transmitter of Vivoplay.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later, others wrote that the Internet coverage of VPITV and El Capitolio TV be no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online broadcaster overtook pictures of the protests in Caracas, which were organized by oppositionable groups, contracted by the Nicolás Maduros government.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began in early April after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the tasks of Parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author of Global Voices, published the results of a Traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection is stuck, and receive the users to get access to the Internet, VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the internet.</seg>

<seg id="401">Traditional media have been involved in the coverage of protests. at that time, the Commission for Telecommunication initiated them with fines and closing statements, when the Commission would continue to report on demonstrations, as the Commission saw this as "call for Violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative national TV channels I registered with @ vivoplaynet again.</seg>
<seg id="403">Amazing that this is still cheaper than to buy two litres of Limonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEsinte later confirmed that not only Vivoplay due to a blocking of domain name system (DNA) is not accessible, but also two further online stations. this also concerns the website, on which the National Assembly transfers their meetings.</seg>
<seg id="405">Earlier follow-up of the institute for press and society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, we had indicated that local internet providers had to use DNA. thus it is a technique due to the DNS server incorrectly answer certain domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a website has been blocked by the DNS server, the server is incorrect, or refuses the request to call such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS lock: @ iModoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">At VPITV, a third-pered channel, the transfer was set on Thursday, April 6, when the VPITV channel Elvis Flores, who took the protests in Caracas, was put into prison.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten, while he was in custody for the police.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later, he was released, and VPITV went on show again.</seg>

<seg id="424">However, what does not mention, that the children have to pay for countless days of housework which will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that can't be raised within the context of a contract that you cannot raise.</seg>
<seg id="425">This is known as Criadazgo practices in Paraguay due to the involvement and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After graduating from their studies, Alvarenga worked for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Criaditas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collect witness testimonies and refusing.</seg>

<seg id="464">When the school was at the end, she went back home and had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="465">The more time they were finished with learning, the more free time.</seg>
<seg id="466">But this time was limited, because she had to make dinner for their employer.</seg>

<seg id="500">Picture of Pixabay, modified by Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="501">Published under the Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian parliamentary counters have recently approved a bill to "regulators concerning the use of social and social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "" "" "when he is accepted by Parliament, users must register social media in Egypt to a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter." ""</seg>
<seg id="504">On the basis of the law, a place would then be set up in order to share social media, citizens and citizens.</seg>
<seg id="505">Within six months with acceptance of the law, users have to register for users on the site of the site with their right name and number of staff numbers to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If it fails to do this, this could bring a penalty of up to six months "imprisonment or a fine of money.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill, consisting of six paragraphs, and in local media including Youm7 and Egypt independent, defines social media as "jedwede application, which runs over the internet and is used to communicate with others by voice, video editing and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is passed when it is assumed, since the draft has no indication of how to account the Egyptian authorities to provide users who are not able to register for the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure regulation on the level of the social media company.</seg>
<seg id="509">Riyad Abdul Zahar, parliamentary elections and sponsors of the law, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users and users received a user name and a password to get through the firewall that blocks Facebook. "</seg>
<seg id="510">This could mean that Egypt is planning to judge a firewall at national level around Facebook. due to them, it would be necessary to submit information on their identity to access the network.</seg>
<seg id="511">But it is not known so far that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts on site are skeptical concerning the technical feasibility of the preluent.</seg>
<seg id="513">Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Engineer (in German "Leading Research Officer") of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, on German "Egyptian Initiative"), told Global Voices:</seg>
<seg id="514">I highly concentrate on the technical capacity and the understanding of neither the authority in Egypt concerning things which have to do with technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">In my opinion, they imagine that same as they could control both physical public and private rooms, it could also be done online.</seg>
<seg id="516">If I contact them, then this means that they will receive a strong monitoring system to make citizens free or not. and this means a mad system to monitor the activity of mankind and also to maintain a court process.</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">In order to be adopted as a law, the draft plan must first be discussed at the legislative elections and the constitutional committees before it enters the debate.</seg>
<seg id="519">Whether its assumption and implementation will be successful or not, the draft "stands in line with a pro-military monument in parliament, in which the meaning has been increased and ensured that no different scration is present on the image surface," says Raoof.</seg>
<seg id="520">Last year, Tamer El-Shahawy proposed a law against Cyber-criminality in which a life-long sentence for those planned to be found guilty of threatened by "public order," and "to protest."</seg>

<seg id="527">Why is this particular type of leopards so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">As Raza in the video shows, "is the Persian Leopard the only remaining robbery in the Kurdish ecosystem" and the health and the growth of ecosystem. it depends on that a large robbery is present.</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, the daily Kahoku Shanno, which was achieved for the northeastern Japan, the advances that were affected in the last six years. a massive earthquake, a tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima happened the disaster.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shanno-Zeitung has its headquarters in Sendai, which is in the Prefecture of Miyagi, was an unusual prefectures in Japan's northeast, which had to experience the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbors of Fukushima and Iwate have been evacuated, because the tsunami had to disappear all coastal cities from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">In addition, the Fukushima prefecture had a nuclear accident, already alone, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of Kahoku Shanno shows a local view that reaches progress of six years later to rebuild the life of local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes both the statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority as well as the survey results of the affected themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The housing structure in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shanno-Zeitung reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned spare parts (Correspondence, Coryagai kouei yutaku) was completed in the prefectures of Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi could be the biggest success among the three prefectures, 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwata has completed 75 percent of these houses, while being at Fukushima, with 70 percent of its final light.</seg>
<seg id="554">It is, even six years after the catastrophe, evacuated of the camps (which documents, kasetsu juutaku) in final substitute houses.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such containers.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the evacuation originate from Fukushima still lives in emergency shelters, whereas more than 75 percent of the evacuated evacuated houses, which were subdued after the disintegration, were converted into final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the figure is 34 percent here.</seg>
<seg id="559">The stand of work and daily life in the three concerned prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shanno-Zeitung could determine 1074 of 1100 schools, which were affected by misfortune, its doors to December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While almost 100 percent of fishing companies in Iwata and Miyagi have now been operating in Fukushima, only 30 per cent of fishing ports have been reregistered in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the nuclear accident have moved in the three prefectures agricultural land.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi could recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas where only 66 percent of the farmland in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed arable land in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that only a result of the atomic fact is, since only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed arable land of Fukushima in the nuclear-armed zone. "</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures the tourism has recovered all again, but Fukushima still remains routed.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist figures in Miyagi and Iwate are back up to 90 percent on the same level as before the misfortune. Fukushima happened here only 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shanno-Zeitung reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants, it is more difficult to earn their habitat.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to determine a complete design, the newspaper conducted numerous surveys under the native population and under the evacuation. she asked them about the stand of rebuilding and, as their Empower has changed over against the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction of article the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shanno conducted a survey in order to bring more about the tsunami consciousness among the native people in experience.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey conducted that 83.1 percent of local residents spoke to be prepared in order to be prepared for the future earthquake and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents say that there was still not enough in catastrophes health prevention.</seg>
<seg id="575">As it is about those who had to be evacuated from the Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake that Kahoku Shanno-Newspaper has strengthened its attention also on the position of the evacuation of Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima still had to experience the massive earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, the prefecture of Fukushima was also a witness of the worst, catastrophic disorder, which had to be done in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160 000 evacuated from Fukushima, almost 63 000 people were moved out outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 there were more than 23 000 people, back to Fukushima, had been converted into durable replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="580">According to the 2017 stand, 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima still live outside their homeland prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">Most of the evacuation areas are the most of the evacuated plants, older than 50 years old. they must compete in proper accommodation because the efforts have to compete for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima with massive construction projects. this is to be part of the Olympic Games which will be held in Tokyo in 2020.</seg>

<seg id="595">A Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week into the intensive care unit: last Friday, a police officer had been defeated at a demonstration in Goiânia during a demonstration against the head. in the nationwide, millions of demonstrators took part in a protest against aumbs.</seg>
<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who studied social sciences at the Federal University of Goiás, has suffered a skull-brain trauma and several fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors undertook him this Saturday and now put him into an artificial coma.</seg>
<seg id="598">His condition is considered critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus, which spread rapidly within a few days quickly in Brazil.</seg>
<seg id="600">The images also shows the face of the police officers, which was identified with a stroke. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">After incident the military police in the Brazilian state of Goiás announced that Sampaio had suspended until the conclusion of the incident of the active ministry.</seg>
<seg id="602">The pictures show the police officers, such as he strikes in Goiânia with his impact on the face of the student Mateus Ferreira (photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">Would a police officers have a demonstrators, and in the intensive care unit, his face would be on display for six months, and the whole of the repression would be justified.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook page "Desolalizador," a press channel of media activists from Goiânia, divided the video on the net in which you see how Mateus is attacked by police officers and several washes shortly after him.</seg>
<seg id="605">Another video with the same scenes, but filmed from another perspective, is also immersed in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="606">In the bottom shown clip you can see the attack on Mateus down the 50th second.</seg>
<seg id="607">For the family of Mateus who lives in another state, Internet users have donated 10.000 Brazilians Reais (approximately 2,700 euros) to allow a portion of the costs for medical treatment and to stay in Goiânia while he is in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="608">"be valiant, Mateus.</seg>

<seg id="612">On Facebook, Professor Pablo Ortellado calls for other violent attacks against activist in Goiás:</seg>
<seg id="613">Goiás experienced a wave of political force: here the activist Guilherme was murdered in secondary schools, because he was forced to sabotage the Occupy Movement in secondary schools. and now we have attacked the very sad case of Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who was attacked by a policemen who has attacked him with a policemen.</seg>
<seg id="614">Police grips</seg>
<seg id="615">Goiás was not the only state in Brazil where it arrived in the past Friday to brutal police courts against demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="616">Policemen trained protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro, where demonstrators had built a stage for Redner, rubber handles and Tränengas.</seg>
<seg id="617">The Flavio Serafini, Social and Peace Party (PSOL), asked the police via speaker to refrain violence against demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="618">This includes a report in Folders de S. Paulo, one of the oldest papers in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="619">Again, the Brazilian media streets once again distorted by introducing the focus on another, unexpected protagonists: a window disc.</seg>
<seg id="620">The folha de S. Paulo and estado de S. Paulo reported targeted about a broken glass window, to illustrate it with a photo of its cover pages.</seg>
<seg id="621">By contrast, the O Globo's title story with a set of a set in fire.</seg>
<seg id="622">There is no plausible journalistic reason, more about a broken window disc than the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a specific thing.</seg>
<seg id="623">This should also be seen if you stride against any form of damage.</seg>
<seg id="624">The term "vandalism" received a absurd, undisproporous significance, and the typical violent actions of the military police are forced by headlines with the "demonstrators" frontation with the police. "</seg>

<seg id="626">With the introduction of the Act of Álvaro Reynoso conducted nearly hundreds of sugar cane factories in the whole of Cuba (Photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The community of Gregorio Arleé Mañali, which is located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is commonly known as a Central - on Spanish sugar mill - known, regardless of that there is no significant sugar content on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities were fabricated in the sugar cane factories.</seg>
<seg id="629">After conservation, the sugar cane industry in the region remained silent, and the factory lost after and after its facilities, until the rumours of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">Approximately 272 workers had to be reinvent.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changes the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Other resigned and commute daily to the factories which are still grinding.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier veteran who stands every day at 4: 00 in the morning, the crisis in the sugar cane industry did not work his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that in the east of the region of sugar cane factories, which are back into operation after a long-active time, because they have been received.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he was not expected.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene reminds us exactly that in MañalI would receive the sugar cane factory, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry already resistance to plagues, the case of socialism, the low market prices, the inefficiency, the poor administrative decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the 1910 produced quantity.</seg>
<seg id="639">The message would have been a motive on some decades for the evidence for the country, but the bad harvests have been no more new.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar industry switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old platform of the commune saw even better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economical need: the 155 sugar mills factories were technically obsolete, and hardly competitive they were inportable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to focus on the most efficient factories, the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories which can produce sugar for maximum 4 Centavos (0,03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motifs that led to such measures were the slight productivity of the sugar cane plants and the sugar crisis on the global market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless the sugar price increased from about one decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">By 2017 through 2025, the price of unrefined sugar has to remain in between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the report "Regional Policy Perspectives" from the OECD and FAO, the Agriculture and Food Organization of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="650">If current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar cane would generate about 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not all ran well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today's Day will go through security in history," "" "these were the first words of the Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lavandero." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From there the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, the shutdown from a total of 98 bodies of sugar mills, more than 65 million people received their full salary for further education.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar tube factory Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez has been working in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">If Nene, as it is known as a soldier, is talking about the closure of the factory, is the word which he repeats most, "fraud."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents are in the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order to obtain the place, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Prior to the beginning of the first year, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was officially written by the official documents, which would only be made concerning the parts that would be removed from the addsat and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the Minister could approve any removal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From there the responsibilities were superimposed on and the letters were more likely to be more common.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the feeding factory for two years, and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money," he assures them still in operation.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years, waiting for the retirement in another complex, Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was against his will in the breastfeeding of the factory in which construction he helped.</seg>
<seg id="667">With every part he removed the dismantled of one of his 31 years of work.</seg>
<seg id="668">The best developed industrial area of Cuba and most important workplace producers have been extinguished.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, there were no alternatives for the working sites and services rendered in the municipalities in which they were present.</seg>
<seg id="670">We will never know if during the mammoth talk of 21 October 2002, the former president moved to the eyes of the present persons, when he guaranteed, that for the areas, whose factories were not in operation for five years.</seg>

<seg id="674">After two years the community of Gregorio Arleé Mañalich learnt that many things change, but not always to better when a factory is closed.</seg>
<seg id="675">When the sugar tube factory closed, or better, when they began to do it, they also listened to the asphalt road, this also disadvantageous other establishments.</seg>
<seg id="676">Without work in the region, and with already advanced age, Nene and Eddy had to look for other factories.</seg>
<seg id="677">They were spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="678">Without any future perspective, many young people left the region.</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people of the First Nations communities in Canada are dealing with themes that are important for them. they do they deal with Hip Hop, thanks to a number of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N 'we Jinan-Tour we offer workshops for schools and youth centres to accommodate youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live recording.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the pedagogues of David Hodges, who lived in Montreal and worked in North-Quebec with ten cree communities and then with the Cree Hip-Hop group The Northstars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop will thus raise that the young participants in our conversations topics such as "cultural identity, language, confrontation, love, self-acceptable," or whatever has to be found in mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos where young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team worked together with other first Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Winnbago in the US state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the School 'Na Aksa Gyilak'Yoo in the area of the tribe of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia tells about the history of highway 16, also called "Highway of tears," a street section in West kanada, where nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women have disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unexplained.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemhi Cree First nation uses the motive of a video game to communicate how important of the receipt of traditional customs and customs of war despite the influences by globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, even though the young people do not always rule the tongues of the first Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation will have recorded, the refrain will be sung in Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved young people received a little help from Gary Jolly of the Northstars Hip-Hop Group that gives them a drop in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">At the Facebooksite of N'we Jinan, the Strophe is available, as well as a translation into English, which is translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel when nobody would find me interested in me.</seg>
<seg id="706">But I continued to go on the earth out of my days</seg>
<seg id="707">That is the day when you will take our crii</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we lost our way in life as a youth</seg>
<seg id="709">But I think we will rise up a day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how to live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">So they can grow and lead us as well as our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">So, they can do that, for what it is appointed to the Creator?</seg>
<seg id="713">In the commentary part, the reader and the author of Cree-language Kevin Brousseau also adds a contribution and add the Strophe in Silicon writing (which is also published on his blog and published here with permission):</seg>

<seg id="720">Customers see this plastic dishes and decide whether they enter or continue to the restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is an entire industry devoted to the production of this plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Kappabashi district, there is a multitude of these small companies that produce those plastic courts that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders produced in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese these are these plastic dishes so usually that they don't want to stop them any more. a new trend, however, is transformed into conspicuous mobile accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matina, the blogger itinii series published by social media links and photographs that show this unusual twist with the shocuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new with plastic dishes, decorative tapes to be shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu Kaufhaus.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods have been turned into kitshifts, such as in this case, cooling and magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are some Shooting fridge magnets for a new exhibition in Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of essences will increasingly elaborate increasingly.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case, a kaans-don (a popular travel bowl has been transformed into a mobile phone stand).</seg>

<seg id="737">"" "there is someone who would say," "" "Wow, cool, now I can shave my mobile phone with salmon?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will probably be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also accept a less appetite form to surprise for example colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile phone stand has the form of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition there are also travel balls (onigiri), earrings and hand bands from dried salmon.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports and foreign media about the infamous "struggle against drug trafficking in Mexico, the missists and killed regularly only in statistics. this reflected not the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle with itself.</seg>
<seg id="750">The coverage of drug bosses like El Chapo Guzmán, the boss of the Sinaloa cartridge, pushed the stories of the victims of conflict entirely in the background.</seg>

<seg id="753">That is why the Mexican news portal of Político is the digital project "Apra a Vivir Con El Narco" (german: "with the drug trade"), who will give to this victims to give a voice and stories about people who were in the struggle between the prosecution authorities and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project so:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organizational crimes can't be feared by our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The consequences are far profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, if business close, because they are threatened by drug traders and will therefore have to travel many kilometers for many kilometers to buy something like milk.</seg>

<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a vivir con el narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">We do not only show the faces of those who are afraid of fear. we must show the conflicts of conflicts to show the fragility and the state of the state.</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a woman from Animal Político, wrote this post by Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in Central texts.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that violence should never consider as normal as normal, in which form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I've been familiar with illness and sensory journalism now for a few years.</seg>
<seg id="780">I pass every day at newspaper kiosks and see the cover pages with images that actually can come from a textbook for criminology or taken from specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I have the feeling as if I am the only one who was hindered or sad. it acts as a lack of respect to the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be equal to or this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin remember that he is great. and it is not normal that people listen over the "heroic deeds" of offenders if they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me, that would be those who have lost someone who lost someone and those who fear for them also something happened.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness, if stories are to be naked numbers in a statistics.</seg>
<seg id="788">The human essness of people is incredible for me when death of six people and the disappearances are justified by 43 students in a neighboring village that they were being moderately being moderately. "</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they're trying to agree that they are spared from such tragedy if they are not silent and quietly.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution "Four Months Revival in the capital city: like a family with drillings was sacked." in this she describes how armed crime was destroyed for month money from their business, until they were not only destroyed the business but also their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think all that you lost, and how many people may change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain never goes up, the sadness of trauma, the fear comes again, when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, telephone numbers also.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The further we are removed from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She completed her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want to be arrested that the others are arrested, because you don't know when they will lead you or to kill.</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked myself in these terrible days if you would like to dissolve my deep root feelings, but the answer is no, because I have forgotten how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the contribution "The forgotten children of Ciudad Juárez: a generation of violence."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction, he puts questions on how to: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organized crimes?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to rise in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexican?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other young boys of his age, whose parents are of care of them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a fatherless and he tells himself, how to make an egg cooked, potatoes, tortillas, and "Chichi" for the babies that lives with him. this is his name for the preparation of flacon with water, sugar and dairy powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine narrows on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are unimportant in comparison to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for the whole life of violence, and who had to learn to live thereby.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, one told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But that was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was past two years before, when he was just a few blocks away from his home, the bloody bodies of his father, who had been shot by armed men from a front-driving car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez was seen:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 when violence was mixed by the organized crime and struggle against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murder to public security and government of the United States government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the prosecutor counted 3103 Morde. this corresponds to average 8.5 Morden per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are only some of hundreds of thousands of stories that leaves the organized crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only few stories live in view of always new headlines. this project reminds us of those who are not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Apra a Vivir Con El Narco," Animal Político, launched the data journalism project Narcodata, whose goal is to illustrate complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trafficking, which has crossed the country in the past four decades.</seg>

<seg id="818">The fact check is important in a moment in which it comes to withdraw a rumor or a fake.</seg>
<seg id="819">But how is the years being immersed in social media? content in social media, whether it is true or true, to continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this photo of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of Congo seven years ago.</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first publication it has been used to adopt the tragedies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false copy of image and event - "wrong description" or "false context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - denied not the fact that there is plenty of careful coverage of events in the DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it throws questions about our desire to messages.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010 a tanker crossed the place Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tiled and exploded. 230 people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa was second largest country for many years, and thus devastated thereby. the streets in the region became dangerous paths with impact holes that were difficult to ride.</seg>
<seg id="827">The tank-wagons fell victim to the victim.</seg>
<seg id="828">As a representative of a fire, the dozens of houses are described, including a cinemas close by, which was full of people, illustrate the soccer world championships.</seg>

<seg id="832">Above is an example.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of carbonized body, which are blown up on the ground during persons.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story finds no end here.</seg>
<seg id="835">More than the years, the same photo was wiped on social media, blogs and other platforms, but certainly not attributed to the related tragedy, in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What and what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015 the combatants of the Boko Haram invaded the village of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastically of atrocities before whom they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies were burned in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports of which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">But the figures could not be confirmed. "no one remained back to count course," said a resident on Human Rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were zoned, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only from satellite images the following time could be illustrated.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unexplained, but the armies in Bagha had been a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the attempt to win the Boko Haram, country (examples from the year 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the image taken from the DR Congo again, as proof of the fact, as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this abusive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of patches with flaws; Africa check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the picture was taken as a cover for mass mockers.</seg>
<seg id="852">Another step further provide personal comments such as this example from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to provide arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture from Sange also occurred in conjunction with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a flash of lightning, published by the United Nations, those who were able to flee rapes, rape and some dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported on violence against the Rohingya, Posts appeared as the following that these descriptions were gathered with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an Saudi-Arab news page, which led to 2012, the President Myanmars Thein said that monks and politicians had involved in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image from the DR Congo to resolve this information.</seg>

<seg id="861">Using a "inverted photo search," you can see how far the borders can be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="862">A converted picture-search with the search engine of TinEye has found 344 pictures of 344 at 18.8 billion images (as of May 3, 2017), which are very similar to that of the DR Congo.</seg>

<seg id="910">The article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication is the picture still contained in it.</seg>
<seg id="911">Spain, 2015 / 2016.</seg>
<seg id="912">This article from 2014 on students who have been killed by the Boko Haram, published by the catholic close message Análisis Digital, has expressly explained that the picture is not taken by the redress, but it claims it a "similar-layer assault."</seg>
<seg id="913">When the picture was later in circulation with the massacre of Boko Haram of 2015, the newspaper El Pais tried to contradict that it would be connection to Nigeria.</seg>

<seg id="915">The picture of the DR Congo appeared, fitted with this Twitterhashtag, and replaced a discussion under Muslims under the Boko Haram 2015 and the stop on Charlie Hebdo in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="916">They wanted to achieve that their communities found these events that took place in the name of Islamic State, a major attention.</seg>
<seg id="917">United States, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="918">The picture was tortured as a letter to the massacre of the Boko Haram 2015 (and more than 9.300 times save), but the messages that were linked to them were taken in no religious context.</seg>
<seg id="919">Instead it was the goal of teaching attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of the media reports in comparison of Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Hebdo.</seg>
<seg id="920">Vietnam (ese), 2014.</seg>
<seg id="921">After a message that was supposedly written by a "Father Juan Carlos Martos" on the Nigerian massacre, in circulation, there were discussion forums as this here in Vietnamese and explained it to the issue of issue.</seg>
<seg id="922">From the message which contains the image from the DR Congo, the organization of the Clark Missionaries and Pater Juan Carlos Martos was distanced.</seg>
<seg id="923">There are further confirmed examples of a defective use of the picture from Sweden, Poland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="924">On other accounts, generators and sites in the following countries (on the portfolio in grey) shows TinEye also, but are no longer fully traceable: Czech Republic, Australia, India, Peru, Netherlands, Ethiopia, Sri Lanka, Azerbaijan, Japan and possibly China.</seg>
<seg id="925">(data entries with URLs and time / date stamp, they exist on the Webcrawler, and have some image file names associated with Nigeria or Rohingya Muslims.)</seg>
<seg id="926">In all these cases, which only appeared clearly after the original accident of 2010, the image may finally leave a correct description but the original contribution is not available or accessible.</seg>
<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong issues or frames (irradiation) that attract these posters. the first frame is focused on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in terms of greater discussions about silence in relation to the hortation of Christians by Muslims or - to the defense of Muslims - the victims of the Rohingyas through Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second Framing uses the picture to discuss how an African life is assessed as opposed to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Religion understanding and the value of human life is both important. therefore it is worthwhile to examine how pictures can be used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">A lower question is however, what happens if readers can't give these images no longer faith.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are ninety people who have unintentionally, the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggerated this mood of malnourish and false information that actual atrocities are invisible and decorate the real horror of what is actually done in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of forcible images was already made in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">A argument is that the retention is equivalent to images of a refusal to recognise the tragedy. sometimes these pictures are even demanded by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, concern that forcible images readers and viewers desiring to feel the ability to empathy empathy (such as this study, who sought to act as forcible media to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot regarding forcible representations in the media media, fact, it is fact that they are indispensable for the current news report.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "Fake News". you will thoroughly have to think about the situation in which a picture is suggested, but also replaced by the context or completely unbreakable way.</seg>
<seg id="940">Any examination of a false subsidy should also be taken into account as internationally as they can.</seg>

<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), it is the number of stories in their original language a possible response.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported a brief initiative of Steven Bird, the Unreplaceable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">However, the focus of TLS is not written in written but on the spoken word. it is a try to obtain the language variety of major cities and to kill.</seg>
<seg id="1140">Indeed, in urban areas, like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia, or Oakland in the United States where TLS has already carried out events since 2015, the risk that small and not quite small languages are not given to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project,:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the world's languages can be avoided if we take cities to accept diversity - safe spaces that are not forgotten in which inhabitants are to be attributed to.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "during" "" "often they are often associated to understand" "" "are these events instead," "" "listen to feel to feel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storyteller presents their history at first in their own language, or translating or explain it in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are no professional storyteller, their dedication and their representation is that the audience can rely on it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call merry and emotions, as the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional story of Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round, the story of Rassidatou is also the opportunity to discuss the country's typical customs of customs.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event John Nyamusara tells the fak from the bunnies and the Pavian in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After he declared the importance of his fabel, John Nyamusara is asked: "how is this to speak to an audience, that will not understand your language?" with a wide grineness he shares his feeling of insofter:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have heard!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were very with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling took place in three cities, and the organizers hope to expand this. all who are inspired by the project can organise your own story in contact with TLS.</seg>

<seg id="1182">The syrically Palestinian web developer Basle Khartabil, also known as Basle Safadi, has been missing for over one year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and members of the campaign will continue to recall the contributions that he made an open net.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: PUBLICA, the annual conference of digital culture, which will be held annually in Berlin, dedicated a event of the # FreeBasle campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the French-based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, Managing Director of Book Sprints' finished books within three to five days, lases Extracts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inser (The Cost of Freedom: a collective afterresearch).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book, published in the last year, and here is licensed freely, contains a number of essays that deal with free culture in the presence of repression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is an homage to Basle and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to create how movements for free knowledge are built and what the true costs are linked with which this is associated.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors, who are involved in movements for free knowledge, side worked on site to look over the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and create something in our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Basle Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer, which has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was knitted from the directory of the Adra prison in which he sat on October 3, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then we have no information about his present state or location.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice which want to release on his release, and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">To see how Bassel has paid a high price for his participation in a free culture, has many of us start thinking about their own destinies, actions and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What do we have opted for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we abandoned in this process of timestly extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">Since March 2012, the Web developers for Open Source and digital activist has been in detention of Syrian government authorities since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military institution which was transferred to an unknown destination.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer in Noura Ghazi, reported that the "Military Police Bassel had taken on the basis of a" strictly secret "commissioned by his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she had been contacted by individuals on November 12, 2015, who presented themselves as the Insider-government to put themselves in knowledge of an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His dwelling place and condition remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects like Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in the Internet and knowledge to the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist, and currently superbly the director of New Palmyra, a project which founded Basle, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Bassels cultural prototypes were predictive than the work that he started to reconstruct the ancient ruins Palmyras in 2005 in order to reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archeological sites in the world, was the waymark of numerous civilian populations and here the greek-Roman architectural types of hitherto traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Basle was able to know that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would be all about that architecture that is not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This passage into the digital archeology and the conservation has created a time capsule which will be presented to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future of unestimated value.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Basle could not yet close this project until now.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband, his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my whole life that dreaming of freedom and Bashsel taught me to embrace her arms.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Basle brought English to me, even when he was already in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He always has his knowledge with everyone who has asked. he has taught others to read and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Basle opened my door to the technology, and he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also had other incares, as they use computer, at least theoretically, without that they had actually held one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Warten), a sabre that she wrote in prison in the years 2012 to 2015, when he was in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together in the book together for a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She sailed the lyrics by him when they visited him, and translated them out of the Arab to English.</seg>

<seg id="1229">That I sinter in the world of your enchanting eyes,</seg>
<seg id="1230">That I lose the improvement in the moment in which we embrace us,</seg>
<seg id="1231">That any of the dangers doesn't matter.</seg>
<seg id="1232">Each of the fences, shackles and guardians</seg>
<seg id="1233">I forget the scurge of the prison</seg>

<seg id="1247">Bassel's story is not unique in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1248">According to the protests against Bashar al-Assets, the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian Network for Human Rights) have disappeared for more than 65,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or executed under violence through the regime were tortured or executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">By 2016, according to international human rights organisation Amnesty International have died at least 17.723 Syrians in jail since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1252">The Global Voices community calls for the release of Basle since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1253">We repeat today our demand in hope that we have to do for the last time.</seg>
<seg id="1254">Mozambique: due to corruption in the case of corruption, he was again foresepered to the post office.</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mozambiki reacted to a corruption in which a government member returned to the workplace after half of his sentence to the workplace in which the corruption has been committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is the Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison in 2010 together with four other defendants for violation of 54 million Metikal.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds of the airports of Mozambique, the Council of Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately asked his reinstantments to the company, which happened on April 19, then too.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with an opinion of the General Attorney of the Republic, which granted the application, there was no obstacle for Cambaza, to refer to his old post, as the company was no discipline proceedings after his imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1260">But many inhabitants are not good.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The centre for public integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, shortly CIP), a local institution which places for public transparency, condemned in an interview with the Deutsche Welle, the decision of the company to relocate the director:</seg>
<seg id="1262">Represents a setback in the fight against corruption and illustrates the lack of transparency and is even a step in terms of the efforts of our legal systems, the CIP.</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we have noted that also the company should have a discipline procedure against the irresistible option.</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the company was silent, but not appropriate legal steps for the application of appropriate functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Mosambique social media, rejects this behavior as well as "resistible":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza would be a competent body, he would have been a consultant after he was sentenced to prison and half of them.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could only hold lectures and motivating speech, he could advise and polishing his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But as he is competent, he has approved to be reintegrated into the company, which he helped to harm.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Resistors!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitterness Viage, young Mosambique and Student of Political Science in Brazil, says the director no Moral:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza was rewarded by the state because he couldn't believe that someone has rewarded someone to such a way that has already been severely damaged the state.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza is missing the morals to return and serve to the state, * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead, only himself is served on the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state, as this man had turned out to be an inexhaustive money source and the state itself was weary of this man, who was uploaded and convicted to a long prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeúte preferred to remember the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel to remember that a thief was put in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to the prison of Samora Machel will not only remain as the first independent president in memory, but also as a sharp, cutting and - by the prophetic speakers.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous oral representations, when he became more energetically confirmed that "an ambitious man is too strong, even the paternity for his ambitions, his own individual interest, for sale."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora said: "I don't know if a ambitious man changes, my experience shows that this is not the case. he changes the tactics, but he doesn't turn from his ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">An ambitious man is criminal criminal. "</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter the reactions were also leaning:</seg>
<seg id="1282">Cambaza was sentenced to 22 years in prison, he was 10 years old and came free.</seg>
<seg id="1283">And today, the company, with which he is the money repented, again under contract. # AssimvaikoveuPais - Testibly. (@ azmal _ Rafik), May 12, 2017</seg>
<seg id="1284">Emildo Sambo from the magazine @ Verdade (to German.: @ Truth) states that criminality is paying in Mozambique:</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook blocks the racist word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censored many users to wrong</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Burmese word "Kalar pae" means Kichererbse or spelling.</seg>
<seg id="1288">Photo of Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Data</seg>
<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network adopted its Posts from the net because they contained the word 'Kalar' abstained.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although more than the origin of the word is still being discussed, it is usually used to refer to people East Indian origin, or generally used as adjectively "Indeed".</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook is licensed to the word "Kalar," (in Burmese Scripture) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of Hasselt in Burma in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has been given an extremely disappearance Konnotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word, most commonly used by Ultra nationalists as an Hasselt against Muslims, which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in the effort to combat Hasselt in Myanmar, the company has a lot of sensual contents on his platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'can usually be brought together with racism in connection, but the word at itself calls not automatically in Hasselt.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important, # 8212; many people have reported that they also discussed the use of the Word, in which they have reviewed the use of the Word, or to doubt.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition, there are several burial words with basic meanings which have the same accounting sequence like 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair is written on Burmese's' Kalar htaing 'which contains the same letter as well as other words such as' Kalar pae '(Spage),' Kalar oat '(curtain), or' kalarkaar '(curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebookner Aung Kaung Myat explained the various meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of my friends was deleted today, because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However he asked his friends to be wondering whether they knew how he could alleviate his back pain, making it a word game.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The sentence Ku la - "Cure" (Ku) + the Questionword (la) to Burmese - resembles the racist expression, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Heth is the opinion that she must decrease in Hasselt's radical nationalists, but also emphasized that Facebook must be analytical before it all the posters that are suspected in suspected of disseminate racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It's made the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automation will not understand what you are writing on Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What should make it instead, check the post carefully and control it by checking the following words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example "Kalar Htine" (Chair) and "Kalar pae" (Spage).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these three nationalists are spreading in Hasselt, a pretty good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise its Nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action takes a strong signal to all, the language of Hasselt, may not keep the efficiency of this strategy long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China like Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of tags often have a cat and mouse game, whereby the users social networks will simply start to use a new word or an alternative writing of censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to delete his post when he wanted to tell his friends, that the word 'Kalar' is banned by the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I was attentive to this new directive on Facebook, I made a post to announce my Facebook friends that the Word is closed.</seg>
<seg id="1316">"" "Ironically, my post office has been removed from Facebook and has been the liken, post and share of contents for 24 hours, because the post" "" "Facebook community" "" "was not entail" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a variety of postcards from people that have no negative intentions, or just try to show their opinions against the Hasselt radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without Hasselt from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the Post, the author divided his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious foundations are bad in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have been doing more than the beginning of the initiative, for example, the Burmese internet Community to ask advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook is like a well-wanted intention to reduce racism in Burma by their platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Such words are to be censored only more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">It also seems to be as if they start without local context or technical support, and such words as "chair" or "pea curry" have been forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found that they have made mistakes, they did not tempting the deleted postal codes.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had just something more respect for the 15 million benefit that would have a great revenues would have been great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks Lensorship has made a lot of scaffold among the users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of serious, users are now fun and write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of Hasselt to see if your mail will be taken from the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook Posts, which contained no hate, but nevertheless removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text is "I want to sit on a chair sitting and watch the peancurry and watch a Indian movie.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Just to try out whether Facebook contains the mail, which contains the word Kalar. "</seg>
<seg id="1333">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1334">"" "the post says" "" "If you are a doctor, do you heal people?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Over the last five years, extreme nationalistic ideologies and religious foundations have been used to expand social networks in order to expand their voices and their influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, Hasselt is alleged to heat violence in social networks in the congregations in Myanmar, especially in the Rakhine territory, where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists were forced to escape.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been criticised for his announcing the baldness of Hasselt to his burial pages under control.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But rather than simply pressed the word 'Kalar', it would have had better ongoing efforts to settle initiatives in the context of concentrating initiatives and learned of them.</seg>

<seg id="1343">The children's before is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1344">On June 9, 2017, Parliament of the country unanimously decided to adopt a law which is to offer this practice so that the marriage-ready age is now at 18.</seg>
<seg id="1345">Prior to this change of the marriage, some members were controlled, and in May 2016 there came to a large public procession. at that time, brother Harrypersad Maharaj, the leader of the various religious groups of the country was gathered that the state should not be inferior to the country that the age would not have the maturity. "</seg>
<seg id="1346">This occurred unrespecting the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contracting partner of the UN Child Human Rights, the minors of children under 18 years of age. "</seg>
<seg id="1347">The UN's statistics for the years 2002-2012 show that the proportion of children who were with 15 were married, in Trinidad and Tobago 2.8 percent, and at 18 it was 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011 the Federal Office of the country confirmed that between 1997 and 2007 more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements, struggles to abolish laws to children, followed on the feet and rejoiced with great support. undoubtedly, they helped them to bring this outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1350">But did not work correctly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">A Hindu-Guide, for example, had no concerns to say the critics of the children's childhood, they should be damned to worry about their own affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="1352">This species religious opposition sorrowed for tensions in this actually uncomplicated matter, and some doubts came to whether the opposition would agree to the law of the bill.</seg>
<seg id="1353">However, at the beginning of 2017, the bill against the Child was decided - despite 4 senators (among them one woman) of the opposition and an independent who abstained - so that he could be debated in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make it a law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the president of the country has to vote and declare the law.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's Senators released a status update, which read Leslie-Ann Boiselle at Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against the Children's Day was signed in the House of Representatives with 35 votes for this and no single one.</seg>
<seg id="1357">After being decided in the Senate, the draft version can now be made to the law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of the social media user was thrilled because the laws have been changed before finally.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook member Lovell Francis, who is a Minister of Ministers in the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It has too much time and unnecessary Gerede, which has veiled the core of the matter, but do you know what? the children's before is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and that is almost every prize.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel was the opinion, it was definitely long enough to abolish the practice was Lara Quentrall-Thomas that the day was finally come:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public status update on Facebook by Lara Quentrall- Thomas, which says:,, Excellent News!</seg>
<seg id="1363">The spouse was decided.</seg>
<seg id="1364">Minimum age - 18, voices - 35 therefore - 0 against it!!! "</seg>
<seg id="1365">Following Mutota, which belongs to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society that is right open on it, how important the adoption of the law is, noted:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The married age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of religious affiliation 18 years.</seg>

<seg id="1374">Thanks to our members.</seg>
<seg id="1375">However, there is a possible hook in the form of Sat Maharaj, the Secretary-General of the Sanan Dharma Maha Sabha, the most famous Hindu organization of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Before months, Maharaj has announced his intention to make judicial steps to be adopted, and he seems to redeem his promise.</seg>
<seg id="1377">During the General Attorney Paris Al rawi, a author of the law said that it would be quite good when Maharaj would be wished against the law, most of the social media users would be interested in the subject of different social media users.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell proposed:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, if we say instead of the discussion so generally, in a way that we invite you to talk to the state in our bedrooms, "simply targeted about it that they may be abused by large, hard-tweet men who are abused to them in advantage," would you be willing to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you believe that there is no problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">However, whether it comes to an accusation against the law, or not, these legislation is an important step - however, there is still places in the world, on which the children's before in different gradations or remains the standard, even though there is laws that they may teach.</seg>

<seg id="1391">The English-language Wikipedia page was presented on January 18, 2012, subject to the SOPA (Stop online Privacy Act) and PIPA Copyright in the USA, internationally darkened.</seg>

<seg id="1393">Since more than one month, Turkey quails those popular and on the crowdsourcing principle-based encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">The tag for Tag is clear, how important is the platform for users to find helpful information as well as reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV-Series turns against the plywood.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many techniques used to use retracting tools for block websites (a recent article from the New York Times that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world), most of the common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has recently been closed on Wikipedia, as recently published in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University will find regular blockages of the Internet since 2007, after the internet law (No. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">In China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remain closed, several mirrorsides (pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia are mirrored and frequently updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), as the platform all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. calculator computer connections), which does not support on the system of domain name and thus making a complete censorship.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is available in spite of legal prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blogpost, IPFS reports on his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we have heard the messages (on the blocking of Wikipedia), we set everything to select snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, the possibility to read the content of decentralized and distributed.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to see at least any Wikipedia contents, even if they can't reach the website www.wikipea.org itself.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also provided that this step was independently carried out in the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is only for screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the sperm.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consuni from Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansicyclope.org, an open source project that everyone can use to hosten similar glasses if it is closed in the country by Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consuni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices Member, as well as employees at the Panigrahi's Open Week "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a Mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">One gets to another URL which is not the original. that what you see is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially, the server guides the request on the right Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are closed in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">For this is executed by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This entry was posted by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and was originally issued on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community organisation from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was again published as part of a Content-Sharing-Convention.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts India avoid women with greatest care, the name of their husbands, or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead, they use a Pronomen or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chechnisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh women to respect her husband to the husband, as well as the fear of the consequences, they should abnormalized this practice on life.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was sentenced by a headcount and violated by her family and the community of the village, after having had an attached relatives with names.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of their wives also did not call on the name, is also widespread among men. however, they have far less evidence to be feared if at all, they should not come after this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health professionals and housewives, a unique club and thus became fast to the main round table of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place solely for them alone to discuss and discuss the hostesses of the patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">When one of 56 clubs there are in 13 Indian countries, he is part of the campaign # Khelp Badal, which is operated by the community video Volunteers and is committed to mining the patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pawas works for seven years with the help of her videocamera at the discovery of practitioners, such as children's heating up to the ban of HIV- and AIDS infected, and guides these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports about how these clubs were created a safe place for these women and have made them at the same time to ambassadors of the wall.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video, the Rohini revealed in their discussion round, did not support women who would not call her husbands on their name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She opted for this topic because they wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem with which the women can easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">According to the names of their husbands, they are not able to express them all their commitments and never put in question.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Raw ini mean:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes to him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who doesn't stick in it is regarded as a woman without murder.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never made us to this discussion round about this discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband to date, previously tried at home, try out at home, as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round of her husband and her mother in law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother in law and my husband stayed yet long after the video was at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned back to me, and said, I should name him now in his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">Rohini started their first discussion car with this self-confidence in their luggage.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" never before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women were protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection the women tried to bring the discussion with a exercise in gear.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked every participant in the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, offended, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then she asked them, "If we cannot tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us what they want, means that they don't respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equal? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of their husbands on her lips," says Rohini Pawas in the village of Walhe in Maharashtra on the breaking of a centuries-old tradition, in which women also married the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">One woman was so sober that during all the exercise, it was just before him; another decided to allow the whole frustration against him and his family by allowing him to curse him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Even in the Adrenalinese above, with an ancient rogly, the women decided to try out at home to name her husband's husbands in their name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next days, Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini, asked what ideas put them in the head: his wife could not stop his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another plubic member decided to do it while dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law was sorry, she was afraid, and said that there was an error.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said, "Rohini said," I should do it. "</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understandable and the situation arted in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reported how women have tried to stop other practices, such as the wearing of the cinoberred point on the forehead that shows the Ehestatus:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why must only women show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"" "I said to my husband that I would bear the cinoberred point when he would do it." ""</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I heard that, to wear it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women don't have stopped completely, but they think they are now in a better position to choose myself on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussions club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we make a trip at every discussion." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Usually we packed lunches and water go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">I don't want to make sure that the women may make what could hear, "says she.</seg>
<seg id="1522">During the last months, she celebrated their own birthdays in her life with cakes; they danced and sang and talked about things that they had never done before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years now and yet I have talked about some things, for example how our identities are linked to our husbands still never been honestly.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to say certain things to say anything, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round, we have talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only been borne in Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most, the okay, but some wanted to bear a salo-cta, a wide shirt via a trousers, they don't have dared.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After a lot of dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own clothing choice, the morals associated with the Saris and much more, tasted raw carini in a discussion round, so that women could bear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they have decided to plan a trip to Goa to get a trip to Goa where they can carry jeans and make raw materials that they will be able to create it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question whether in the five months since their first discussion club has already changed slightly, Rohini confirms that things are getting slowly into the roll:</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far we have done so small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then they listened to the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, make it still, but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved.</seg>
<seg id="1535">One or two shall still say the name of their husbands; only one or two women bear at each time Zinnoberred on their foreheads.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes that they want to reach in their lives - like the hurries for more freedom of movement or the own dress code - at the end of a difficult to navigate the river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By making their own self-confidence, they are aware of that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How the Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a sacrifice of patriarchats.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am there too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club, each of us, indicates that something is changing.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to only 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman in the club goes home and others talking about what we speak about what we do and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the Video Volunteers community come out of exclusion groups in India and make videos about stories about which is not reported.</seg>

<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on July 8, 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of inprisoned Chinese dissidents Liu Xiaobo has moved attention to international community attention after his lawyer had been announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized due to liver cancer in the Endstage hospital.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "Subversion" (state endangerment) after being challenged in the draft Charter 08, a manifesto that calls for the democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>

<seg id="1639">Norway</seg>

<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway came into the stores after the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 was bestowed to Liu, although the Norwegian government overtook that this did not do with the decision to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">The diplomatic relations have been resumed only in December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to return to China, since the exports had been blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the message was spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee brought his hope for an unconditional release, and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his imprisonment, he was unable to increase his prize.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony, Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>

<seg id="1670">All necessary measures have to be taken in order to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all treatments which he needs, regardless where, needs. furthermore, his wife and his family should have contact to him.</seg>

<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or a country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may appear stupid since Singapore is recognized as an independent state since Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This statement has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting during a meeting of the international branch of the State of New York, the Minister that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared to Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He support that Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has made a question whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">That is, with most people go an error.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to declare that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The blog Cavalierio accaccused the Minister of Justice, "to do logic," to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, according to all our efforts and advances, this valuable country, we hear that we would not be there any land.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It was so vulgar, it had the appearance of a flight before the responsibilities, a mandatory violation.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons mentioned by Shanmugam were not very Nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries, in view of what he appeared unweird.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to Chicago, San Francisco or New York as well as those cities which are permanently run by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once you reach the core point of the subject, again the good old breast from the authoritarian seizers return to be Democrats deserve the turning logic, because they fit better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the final issue of Shanmugam, the last week of Shanmugam gave answers to his American guests in regards to our press, our Judikative, our political system really non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">These questions mean with non-answers to rational type.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls for Shanmugam on his mind, because they did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city is to which country belongs to our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I understand nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our new K Shanmugam would take on the effort to clarify this point where he was paid up in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By clicking on the blog, he has published his comment on the reviews that you should start to understand the whole transcript of the conference, in order to understand the context of the statements by Shanmugam better, according to those of Singapore had a city and no country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore was rather a" "" "city" "" "as a country," "" "he declared that the elections in Singapore said so uneasy, even if we are looking forward to a free and just election." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He distributed Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities have seen a party in decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said, Singapore" "" "is no country," "" "he has obviously not meant in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows its disappointment over Shanmugam, who makes such polemic statement as leader of a heron-growing generation.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am talking about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said very much...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Garde that I expected to do with them or not, but this is another matter.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leader of Singapore, I have doubts and I'm not once sure that he really believes, correctly associated and aware of what he defends.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek review sets the weak spots of Shanmugams Argumni:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Does Mr. Shanmugam has committed an error "? or was it a Freudger spokesperson?</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is no country, we are considered independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, on which country go back the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is an equally country and town.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the government cabinet, the statements by Mr Shanmugam is of serious importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the Singaporedom do their military service, they defend their own country, but not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay our Prime Minister Invoices?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink number of identity?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">In this way, the magazine Journey of a Decade for the Being, Singapore is and always a city:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"I did not say what I said..."</seg>
<seg id="1730">This proposition seems to have become more expensive people of Singapur...</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one has ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We were always a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">I can understand that we often hear statements like "the defense of the country especially" etc., but that's not true.</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should rather speak of the defense of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1740">Their answers will be published here as part of a continuing line with the rumor of certain parts of the world, and another facet should be shown.</seg>
<seg id="1741">The latest installment of this series comes from Nevis Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1742">The question that is set to me in Japan is: "are you Americans?"</seg>
<seg id="1743">"" "" "" "no, I'm sorry," "" "I am coming from Canada." "" "I've been living in Japan again since 1994." ""</seg>
<seg id="1744">Depending on the situation, in which situation takes place, it is considered to be courteous, interested in his talk partner, looking for personal questions.</seg>
<seg id="1745">On my clarification, most often the standard answer is: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice-hockey, nature." many Canadians cook maybe indoor, if they are kept for Americans, but me do not disturb me.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who does not know, there is little, distinguishes us Canadian of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians have a Canadian flag well visible on their backpack if they are travelling.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All love Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Americans, however, Americans....</seg>
<seg id="1750">So it was already when I began 20 years ago to travel through the world - before Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11.</seg>
<seg id="1751">Canadians already carried out little monkey leaves on their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="1752">We have a free health care!</seg>
<seg id="1753">There is no weapons with us!</seg>
<seg id="1754">Gender marriages have been legal in Canada since 2005!</seg>
<seg id="1755">All seem to think, Canada is so great.</seg>
<seg id="1756">We are courteous.</seg>
<seg id="1757">We are obviously very often "sorry."</seg>
<seg id="1758">Canada is supposedly regarded as the tolerant country against ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="1759">We are not like these types south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We are Canadian.</seg>
<seg id="1761">I hate it.</seg>
<seg id="1762">First, I have many American friends I admired.</seg>
<seg id="1763">It would make me nothing, if you would like to change Johnny from Dallas for example.</seg>
<seg id="1764">With Marc out of Austin.</seg>
<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or by Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">There are also some problems with the stamp "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">First: as "nice" signifies, is basically to be diligent to be dispared - such as the benevolent, gentle, but tragically unimportant figure Ned Flanders from "The Simpsons" (one's own Canadian double).</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada is really a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, this would be a step forward. but the real problem exists that "nice" no personality has.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing at which you can stumble.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Harmless, is unobtrusive and uninteresting to earn and no attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This may be something good if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, remotely from the things to pass around.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even go far as far as to say that the desire is to be free and alone to be a main building of the Canadian.</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to worry about our own affairs.</seg>
<seg id="1775">What a "nice" signify as "nice" is perhaps just cool politeness.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians don't talk about the fence with the neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="1777">We lack the warm warm, open kindness, which I connect to my American friends.</seg>
<seg id="1778">Fortunately for us (and for the rest of the world), Justin Trudeau entered the stage to show that Canadians are more than just "nice." our prime minister has made Canada almost sexy.</seg>

<seg id="1780">One in Thailand famous Pop-Band has published a music video which gave the Junta parodized who seized power and reigns in 2014 despite their promise to the civilian government.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (PhawGirl) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man, who tells what regulations make his girlfriend.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not expressly politically, the music video also refers to the continued military domination of the Junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was created by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video for song was a huge success.</seg>

<seg id="1786">Last month, the Charlie-Chaplin video "was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists appear to watch the public.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai policies, especially in particular how it withholds the country's position under the Junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Look at once these pictures of the video, which relate to some of the political issues, which Thailand has been hard-pursued in the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">"" "the" "" "44 rules of the girls" "" "refers to the draconical section 44 of the provisional constitution, which the Commander in Chief of the Healer opposing important national issues." ""</seg>
<seg id="1790">The 11th rule: "change your attitude" refers to the notorious programme for "integration of journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other persons who are considered a critic by the Junta.</seg>
<seg id="1791">The picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer criminality, whose vague and unclear regulations are often used by the authorities to express activists and other critics of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose, a new unit was set up in the army, supervised the online content, and persons, accused of having accused the monarchy, prosecuted and prosecuted.</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand sets a strict key to "Lese Majeste" (Majority ").</seg>
<seg id="1794">On 20 May 2014, the war was proclaimed by the War Law.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later it came to a coup of the army.</seg>
<seg id="1796">One of the problems, which the Junta continues to purchase, is its decision to buy U-boats, although security professionals were warning, that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste from taxes.</seg>
<seg id="1797">In the video, even how people are thrown into a black delivery car before attempting to bring them into an internment camp, another problem case.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Some journalists are sitting in prison because they allegedly caused "confusion" in society, and Internet users are threatened to pay long penalties, they should save the monarchy.</seg>

<seg id="1895">Concepción González Ramírez is a small hotel in tapestula, in the state of Chiapas, near Mexico to Guatemala.</seg>

<seg id="1897">This article by Amy Bracken was published on April 19, 2017 on the website of our Partners PRI.org, and appears here with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="1898">In the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America, certain places will be known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these locations in the Mexican town of Tapachula, it is located on the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is managed by a 59- year-old Mexican, a little woman with a coral-pink Brillienframe and gold coloured earring in teddy moldy form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">It is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. however, they know many among the name of Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This first name is the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a goal for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For approximately $2.50 dollars per night, guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, cropping walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign to the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Hawaiian migrants here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs. Ramírez, the people are coming in full small bushes and from the upper part of the coast they start to call: "mom Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mom Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the time it is rather quiet but in this year Ramírez has already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have already slept without cartons.</seg>
<seg id="1912">They don't want to reject.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and bring them to the hospital when they are sick, they buys them medicines that they could not pay them with a balm that were troubled by the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived at a short time ago.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if mom Africa was a reasonable name for Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The Sebastiao family (with her daughter Merrui, who has a youngsters) take place with Concepción González Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"" "" "" "yes, yes," "" "he answered with a smile." "" "I really feel that it fits to her because African women are very nice women." ""</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very lovingly.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels to Boston with his sister, who hopes to get to Boston to return to her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">You have already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans, who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then go towards the north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard of other signatories of Mama Africa. "mom Africa is a well-known name on the route," explained Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that Haitian and Afrikaner is often travelling together, and that Africans speak on WhatsApp by Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">As many of his signatories, Michelet lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the soccer world championships.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy was weaker, he started his journey into the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa since months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he is in the future with Mrs. Ramírez's contact.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"" "" "" "mom Africa is our mother and we never leave it again," "" "he answered smiling." "" "we will always stay in touch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. Ramírez tells that her guests will send their often text message if they have gone to greet her or to report her about the course of their trip.</seg>
<seg id="1933">It explains that their Christian faith is the drive of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">They don't know much about Africa, but their guests have taken her to prepare chicken as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. Ramírez is perhaps very well known, but it is not the only radio hope for migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a lift pass leads to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">In this winter, Valenzuela and his family lived in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is policeman and has found that the bus visits to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He began to help them to receive a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for one dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment, there are 25 persons, mostly Haitian.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on ceilings on the ground but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests do.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"" "" "" "I have lived in the United States," "" "I have experienced what they experienced." ""</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the wilderness and suffered suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and help others. that's the reason why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States following a raid in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travels across Tapachula comes from Central America, other inhabitants also open the doors of their houses for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children from before men who wanted to take money from him without a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapestula, he asked for an accommodation and a unknown, a variety of stone, has its roof offered to him.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later, the family still lives and tries to decide where the next steps should go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa, everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the course there are the travellers quietly their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus has arrived today and has 20 new guests, most of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs. Ramírez seems happy about that her house is full, but it is nostalgish, because of them that go away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother, she crieth her album with many photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There are one of her daughter with African hairs which you made a client, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughing grieved, while she briefly presented her.</seg>

<seg id="1962">On 10 July, the mobile phones in the Tianshan District of the Urumqi District received a mobile phone information where it shows the District government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or "web cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">In the notification, the app "must hints that the app will have access to terrorist information."</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the authorities used the app to use the app for more than the fight of terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture, because she had installed the app, news with a private WeChat group.</seg>

<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is the option of pornographic Websites, from online fraud, Troians and Phishing pages to make users attention to make sure how much time they spend online and control your own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">The app for minors for minors should help children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can be used in a variety of ways.</seg>

<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures for control of digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While news about digital censorship in China usually focused on the experiences of users in the bigger cities in the East and south, the reality is very often dark for those who are in remote-pressed ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">To limit the rest and dissatisfaction in conflict areas, authorities often arrange extreme barriers and surveillance measures to as well as routinely internet abstentions.</seg>

<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification required that people will install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you have discovered at a Checkpoint with a device without these software, it could be taken up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a blow for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They are forced to use devices that are intended for older people.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, free opinion and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib brings the bulk of its time inside. let it go for his screen, time to his computer, and again at his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers, or his with nicotine defiled lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top of his family-house, which has been part of them since 1967; the year, in whom Israel had forced his occupation of the West Bank, and Hdaibs were forced to flee from their village in Palestine, where they lived as felahyeen (about: Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years Hdaib is a passionate activity that has surrendered to the conservative majority, and their altapproved opinions about gender roles, sexuality and free speech by art and rapture.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, often focusing on issues such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian. all these issues are not only found in his hometown Amman Relevanz, but also in cities, that from Damascus in Syria to the whole Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">At the age of 25, Hdaib sees itself as a man who is not restricted by boundaries, and he can feel with people with the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not open the U.S. foreign policy against the U.S. foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib examines his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib doesn't believe that his compassion for those who are trying to do in war zones, anything that he was born in Jordan as the "Palestinian Gevolateter of the second generation" - so he himself, even when he was born in Jordan, has never been in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think because of my own life circumstances," emphasises Hdaib.</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then he adds: "I think because I am a man, while in the water soluble Nescafé in two cups. it is the holy month Ramadan. in this period it is scheduled to fasten for Muslims from sunrise until sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law states that the public consumption of food is illegal during Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions. on the other hand, a cup of coffee in a sentimely hot Junitag has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically, the gap alizes a warm coffee and the rake of the Kent cigarette in the nose into the first line of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the free sky, especially if you cast a look into the neighboring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, it is simply avoids basic things to do basic things - as in the public during the Ramadan of water - to move up in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Interior Ministry Jordanian has had a show of the band Mashrou 'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentary elections which support the Islamic State Front, argued that the sexual orientation of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual senso, contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country, and the main reason for the concert tables is.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The member and ex-spokesperson of the Islamic Coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert was cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the Sangers.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many claim that the committment of the band in matters like the Arab Spring, human rights and free opinion expressed in the Arab world may become more dangerous activism that authorises the Maltese legitimacy regime in the entire region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila estimates the jorda people as "progressive supporters of human rights" who continue to use "for intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement is probably not to be confused rhetoric, but actually a clearer reality in Jordan reflected in Hdaibs's work clearly.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib reformed traditional gender standards by taking off his vision of the fate of Arab women who have vorelieve sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of obviously unknown, whose arms and legs appear to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the innumerable women who have lost their lives by the hands of those who actually should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In the past few years the number of Honorary morde 'has increased - the unofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to human Rights Watch, the number of Honor in the year 2016 reached its zenith; however, Jordan was still missing that Jordan has become institutional infrastructure to support women who tried to support morphing or domestic violence to be appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law on the Crime of Crime in 1954, women who are exposed to incriminating violence, "must be detained at uncertain time in prison," and for their release is often a year-long bureaucratic effort as well as the guarantee on the family that the woman will not happen.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs music is a great popularity and is well known to reverence the themes that are long as taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is politically, however, he is a fact that he can not become his music, the full exposed anguards on sexuality, freedom and expression of opinion, is not being separated from politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "" "" "he was accepted," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed, Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity in the attack.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb" the focus will be on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are politically, can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib published a song entitled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is often repeated:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and every other is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In further development of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a sort of market, in which one can get in his words, "what you want," - be faith or non-faith, heterogeneity or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that barely any one speaks in Jordan on the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals were still strong in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular jordan Onlineprogramme Roya, later to remember that his comments were torn apart from the context, twisted and confessed his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without any cuts, but he was only a revised version," says he.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today Hdaib advertises the Arabic LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that Intoleranz opposed to homosexuals did not promise to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentioned Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, still remains in memory thanks to its homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks: if Abu Nuwhat should work later on behalf of the caliber, in the eighth century openly about homosexuality could write about homosexuality is not able to do this?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou's Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemian kingdom there is nothing new that the government attacks on the free expression of opinion, and that progressive votes will be brought to silence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the jordan news service took several former government officials and members of the teacher, based on comments in social media that criticises the problems that were deeply routed in corruption in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of what is the concert of Hdaibs, only the tip of ice - the actual challenge is to effect a structural rethinking in the next generation of the Jordanian territory.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, progress is an independent sign and take. Jordan has led Mashrou 'Leila for the second time in a row, but the way of progress - it looks for sure that these changes take place from day to day at the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Finally Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, are from abroad, without interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He dreamed not only to bring his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to experience "them."</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region is, with the help of music, art and literature of a real and basic openness - and not through bombs, streeunitions and on artificial art. at least, he hopes it.</seg>
<seg id="2147">As far as far as it is, hdaib is raging and therefore also resistance to resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was made by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, which was a student Fellow as a student Fellow.</seg>

<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letters to guerrilla</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the revised version of the contribution to guerrillas, which has published the International Online Magazine Tea After Twelve international online magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love letters to people who we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not much more important, people who feel free to meet?</seg>
<seg id="2185">Exactly this question went out to the two young Colombian activists from the Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation, who inspired them to write to the campaign cartas por la Reconciliación (letters to reconciliation), the young people used to write guerrilla letters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently, their country was the venue of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had concluded a peace agreement with the guerrilla movement FARC (german: revolutionary forces of Colombia), which forms the collapse of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">International received the signing of peace agreement as a significant that the Colombian president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits in Nobel Peace Prize.</seg>
<seg id="2188">In front of the column there is a long way until you can talk about a real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrillakele, who lived for many years in illegal camps, were exposed to war rhetoric and contributed around the clock their weapons to themselves in life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society also turn to life in constant anxiety and in some cases a deep hatred to guerrilla had to take it into their ranks, and support them in building a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian convinced that the young column is close together and help to help the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: until now, thousands of people have written letters - love messages to former guerrillas to welcome them again in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for each former guerrillas, which should be handed to personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the Letters of Reconciliation was created on the World Summit of Peace Laureate, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk short with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This declared that we love the people who love to write to thousands of love letters, but those who forgot to need them much more necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plans, he told him to share his love with people in this year who needed most urgent issues.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus, the plan, letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, which now have to build a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is willing to make the discourse of a history of war to a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Until now, more than 2000 letters were collected during the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i have never thought that someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to the Caldono-Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the City Council of Cali and Leonardo from the Foundation Bogotonists into the camps to transfer the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC were on how they had done earlier in order to increase the orders of their leader.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no precepts, but letters full of people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for all parties. "it is incredible how many different feelings may run in just a few hours - from anxiety to happiness and everything that between lies," told the political ignorance student Manuela Jiménez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the Governors of the Valle del Cauca Province described this unforgettable experience as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After being handed over the letters, a former warrior led me by the camp of guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cameleton" (a kind of hut, where the guerrillas lived), I saw a guerrer, who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I had fear, because in addition to him on the bed, a MGL-Pomer was a deadly weapon in the village of Dornröschlaf.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "I asked him, saying," "" "hello, what do they now?" "" "I answered," "" "I am answering a letter that someone has written to me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never in my life, someone has written me something like beautiful, therefore I respond to it. suddenly the tears run over the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him down, and set me beside the Granatwerfer.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was sorry for the war, I was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this cashes, and wanted to help him to write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never had something different from life to war. the FARC was the only way to keep it and his six brothers before the Hungertod. "I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a company outside there, who waits with open poor out of us.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Till now I have only learned how I have to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now where peace is reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">At the beginning, students and some leader of the FARC came to a discussion group.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students had grown up all over the war and the FARC were already in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore the leader of the FARC Society declared the history of the organization, their ideals and insight into their views over the peace process: "for many years we have experienced the social injustice of the State for the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can contribute to the society in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "for a goal of this order, it is worth to overcome all obstacles," "" "said one of them." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">These people, who had never found their hearing, and had no election right to know that people who had often seen as a monster, and even learned them, even people with beautiful feelings that were turned upturned by their circumstances and their environment was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality, in which the country lives, does me hurt.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforted me that all men - also those who have killed and so much damage, may bring us something, and give us a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have answered for the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote Darío de Jesús Monsalve, the Archbishop of Cali, the following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The column was prophesied that after deforestation peace would prevail.</seg>
<seg id="2232">This is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as it gives unequal, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will be always people who are ready to hold arms to raise up and to protect their rights and which is also justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We use the FARC now on peace, to a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">Therefore we call all defenders of peace - regardless of race, religion or ideology they belong to over all those that dream of a country in the war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word to make our contribution and bring sacrifices, because we know from their own experience that nothing is simple. those among us who defend the life as the basis of existence, many difficulties will be impending.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2249">"you have brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">Sabrina, a transine, was born in Grozny, grew up there.</seg>
<seg id="2251">Ever since her childhood she felt that she was a woman in reality.</seg>
<seg id="2252">When they became growing, you became aware that Chechnya was no safer place for them, why they moved to Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="2253">After a group of Chetenen was experienced by the gender equality of their country woman, the hunt was opened on Sabrina.</seg>
<seg id="2254">For fear of her life she moved to the USA last night.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I worked as a volunteer helper in human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day was told me that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">This was a friend of Dagestan, a transine, who put in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2258">She had no money, so I took her without hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="2259">While I was trying to help her, somebody, of whom I thought, he would be a friend, a copy of my documents, and spread it everywhere on the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. then there is no men more in Chechnya that can eliminate this shame? "</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that, photos of my documents we made the round of my Whatsapp.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015 I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I was just doing a few grocery bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a male voice: "here is a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned back, I felt something in my body, but there was nothing hurt to me.</seg>
<seg id="2264">Then I heard a sentence, but this time on the Chechen: "how long will you still honor the family?"</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know that it was a young man, not 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and re-awakened last Endes in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had to receive everything and began to cry out.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned that I had two daughters in my right lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which case were you laid - in whom the men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are obsolete since there is my male name, but the doctor stood and laid me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful to him for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time in his office, I got to do it with fear; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he emerged as good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he is respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than one month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got drenings.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, and wrote me - Related, strange, and some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of an alphabet.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbours and some away.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The requested to send me to Chechnya in order to prove that everything was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They had absurd 'demands: some said to me, I let's prove that I had to stand up at the official television in Grozny, and say that I had not changed my family that everything was just bad, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grated size C - what would I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still difficult for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once said my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">They said to her, "They have brought a monster to the world, that has not only disappointed your family, but the entire republic.</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "we can not touch you, because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and she lay a Strick around the neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately the neighbors and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into a flat and a few hours later, under the window a car with darkened windows and a number plate with a 95 slide show.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it was the third time, it was clear that something was lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My Human Rights friends tested the numbering of the numbering - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how are you fled?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For safety reasons I will not give her name, but I want to say that I remember them all, they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help I left the country, but then something unbelief.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can't understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without getting myself without identification, without everything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw them into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived in and checked in the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered for a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">In the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message: "you don't believe, you would have you in security, just because you have left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people know, in which hotel you are using. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove you: it is number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was really my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we don't talk about the gender equality, however, this is a taboo topic.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still bear some traditional casian elements still in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">So very much I wish I cannot overcome these seaweed barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that, as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to violate them.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with the camera, I actually give me effort to look like the person who reminds them out of their past - thus reminiscent of my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that's very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends do, those who have stayed?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For the needed I needed current information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I spoke with someone to eat one and a half months in Arrigun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that during Ramadan it was not arrested and tortured, but also that all the Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not lock a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">So, I think they probably charge the relations with the concerned person concerned, and in the end require a proof of evidence that the so-called "glory" has experienced by blood.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: will now be pregnant women in these secret conditions?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of me says, there's just not many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">When, above all such that were not rich, or who were left to their relatives or who were left by their relatives to ask Kadyrows.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they will be detained in order to present them later as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Say: should they be killed, they will show their bodies in television and assert them, they would have attacked your village or a military base.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people had not simply disappeared, but specifically underminished to radialize themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this only a mutation or have a source of information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just felt someone who was imprisoned for one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people had disappeared in this prison after her beard had grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new from them since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply have taken it.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was taken up, when these people were taken.</seg>
<seg id="2342">However, they were not introduced as bandits until now, there were no reports so far. we believe that such actions are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would you not allowed to shave those people?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people who belong to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation already in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always bore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think before 2003 I was already known throughout the whole of Grozny, when I was still living there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">On the Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when the Sharia was, I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much more secure than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">Russia originally wanted to bring us back to the "civil war" but ultimately thrown down in the stone period.</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is it possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows had been exhausted, I was colored eyelashes, carried tube jeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Security of the Sharia has never caught a hair, too.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian theatre in Grozny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people like me met.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks stood; and the whole city knew it, they knew why men, young people met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We never have been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a speeching: Kharda ma Kharda. that means "Spoons not about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">It often says to children, if they have fun on the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so did they simply shut up their eyes before you, because they believed they be sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never offended, never chased and never beaten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this answer time?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long, until Kadyrow came to the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to talk about Moral in television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He spoke not about us by se, but rankings over the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel like people in the city began to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">He who had gelding and laughed at once, looked at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the period I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I could feel the situation in the republic steadily worried.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: which activity is now going to go right now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I earn not much - 700 to $800 dollars per month are not much in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="2374">I still operate as a activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicating with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We perfectly organize teetreffs, gatherings, I begat them to the hospital and help them to get food types.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't attain a cent.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people when I had a refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslima and I want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: bear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is Albanian.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So is the nature that has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">That's exactly the same as Chetschens who would like to make you with foam before the mouth that there is no swelling at them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Those who have a Cabardiner who have the Russians also have the Russians also; on the whole planet it is - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it is impossible to hear what to hear.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practising Muslims who go into the mosque and fasten during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">Do you know, many thinking at transidental complexity to men who love men and they believe that they change his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a whirlwind.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different types of a sensation to be exact, different living settings.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me, it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and will not be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry that I'm so personally, but my last intime relationship is already longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not mourning because - I simply know that I am now myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn an increase of self-morden within the impoverished Arab Ahwazi community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">Iranian Awaz region suffer from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty-rate within the local Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Since the last months, there has been a strong increase of self-morden.</seg>

<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi, on August 27, receded the verted situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, which is dominated by poverty and unemployment.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the Awaz region in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered under Angstings, depression, and he sparked himself for his own helpless, who can come up for his family, such as Ahwazi human rights groups who want to work in Ahraz and anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">One on YouTube played video kept the moments after he had kindled himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people managed to delete the flames again, and Moramazi was brought to Taleghani hospital in the town of Ahraz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "" "" "local sources" "" "according to local sources were so strong that doctors could do nothing more." ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide who has happened in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activists before the time that more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some other - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing together: these were all family fathers that were based on the persecution by the Iranian government, helpless, and irable to feed their families, safely and safe work.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment, and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region in which the majority of Iran living in Iran living in the Arab Ahwazi community was shaken by a profound economic crisis, which makes it difficult to fight the native of the local Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2412">In front of a century, Arab Ahraz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi Monarchy was taken over and in 1925 great efforts to end the ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Awaz region there are some of the largest in Iran next to oil and gas areas as well as some of the most abundant and valuable usable area for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite this valuable resource, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the native population receives only little of this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often victims of untreated diseases, hunger and kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime refused Ahwazi-Arabs systematically refuses jobs in local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also built a variety of demons, the waters of the Arab areas in the Persian areas where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and ghom are located.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These demons only led to destroy the devastation caused by dryness in the region, and the local agriculture as well as the fish and palm trees industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawzi-youth has now risen to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian director of cooperating, work and social welfare, told that 5% of Ahwazis who completed a job, completed elementary school, completed 55% of a secondary school and 45% have a university degree.</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... it aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahwazi human rights activist in London, told Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment, and racist of ethnic discrimination," a "high rise" of the number of self-morden among the young Ahwazi men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Dohimi said that particularly the unemployment has become more serious. the reason for this is a combination of a high number in Ahwaz's new ethnic Persians and an anti-Arab discrimination in the integration process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since the functionaries and institutions are not set for Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi will deprived the access to employment opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forced them to earn their habitat outside of their homeland Ahraz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to hide their pros and surname to hide their affiliation to the Ahwazi and so they could not be tolerated as the Arab name at the workplace, refuse the speaking of Arabic language or wearing Arabic clothing.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the given circumstances that have to bear the Arab Ahwazi, human rights activist alarm before the situation exploded.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why do not identifiable me with the feminism, even with the intersectionalized not"</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photos. recorded by: Pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons-License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement dated by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the Afroféminas website. article was an object of several discussions where many different positions came to expression.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I'm not a feminist, there are many women - especially white women who describe themselves as an intersectional feminists - with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not a part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even reasoned well-thought-scientific and social arguments from me why I should be a feminist and why we generally should be all feminists.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, that women still earn less money despite equal education as men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under stringent observation, if it is about doing what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women before, or later in diverse areas of life on a glass ceiling, and that discrimination based on sex may still be across the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is conscious and known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I suffer twice and triple them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black wife.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, if I say on rassism, on black cis women, on black transidente women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community, or on black women from the Diaspora; if I have thought about what kind of physical and verbal misused, both white feminists and white intersectional feminists have been impoverished.</seg>
<seg id="2448">But they all agree that women - all women should come together to get "their voices" to take up their voices and 'Kumbaya, my lord' to sing for equality (some) of the women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about that there is in addition to sexual violence a propositional form of rammically motivated violence, who are exposed to black women in two times.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or about that black women and women of other ethnicas and origin of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background often expelled as white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spawless and women have exposed to a higher risk to suffer domestic violence and violence in the partnership, as white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the other hand, I wish that all men, all men, and all men, neither skin colour have the same rights; on the other hand, I cannot join the white woman in whose center is the white woman who refused to take account unjust to their thinking, which relate to both sex and skin colour of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented sphere that always has and countless other black women always and has turned back.</seg>
<seg id="2455">In her speech in 1851, In her speech, 'Am I not a wife?' and I also refused me to justify a ideology in which the black woman is an inhuman and marginalized being.</seg>
<seg id="2456">I join me to join the groupings, which also absorb our customs and customs, to drive their egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will not try to close white women to overcome the importance of overcutting of skin colour and gender. for some of them will continue to keep the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women are trying to honour them.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the intersectional Feminism was founded to give women of different heron and rendering women with white feminism, still is still the word "Feminism" in his name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I draw it out to release me and quite happy to join the movement of womanism, which was called for my dark skin and my status as wife, instead of me for a white-feminist paradigm that is so persistent that intersectionality is being celebrated as a new phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is important than ever before, to define black women in our own ideas and give us into the dontics that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism: how we can defend ourselves if we can defend us by our own way, in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, seelical, physical and even the spiritual elements can be honours that make up the black wife.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists immediately occur immediately after they have read these lines, please inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures because I exist in this paradigma.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I'm recognized in due to my dark skin and because of my existence as a wife as part of this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can flourish in a environment where my life is neither overthrown, nor ignored, nor rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the abbreviated and revised version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay. the article belongs to the series # PorSerMujer (# forilicheinefraubin), who reports about the violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names were changed to the protection of the people affected.</seg>
<seg id="2482">The Commissioner Ada Báez said that she had nothing against Luis Balbuena, her extras, who had become violent in comparison to her business.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship was elapsed time and the police said, their statement would be laid to the files, but more could not do.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When a further wife Balbuena was used because of mistreatment, the aktensive display of Ada Báez is nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second woman withdrew its ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Violence against women is difficult to break the inflation of violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women talk at all at all, they will not receive support from the State.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women also financially dependent on men that they were harassed. this explains why only 20% of all women who admit victims of violence to be victims of violence at all.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Effective 1 strokes and Statistical 2 Invisible abuse and a legal system that nothing subdued under the law of Paraguay: good approach, manageous implementations and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is hard to determine how many women are really harassed, says Myrian González, researcher for the research fellow at the Centro de Documentación y Ever, a social scientific research institute in Paraguay. "there are different data and reports that show not even to the extent of gender equality against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2491">The provided figures are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, the Attorney General Attorney acquired 9600 ads for domestic violence. at 70%, it went around violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of ads during the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 ads because of domestic violence among the peace geries. 86% of ads came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the ads, 40% of women reported that they were physically disabled, 55% of women said by mental abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">These statistics show not the real extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the Paraguayan female Minister Ana Baiardi will only be shown few of these criminal offences. "on any woman who will be reimbursed in Paraguay for mental abuse, 9 women who do not do this.</seg>
<seg id="2498">For every woman who are reimbursed because of physical abuse, two women who do not do this, declared at the end of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2499">There is no own criminal law in Paraguay, the prosecution authorities cannot be reasonably documented, as many women have murdered every year from their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">By August 2016, journalists counted at least 12 cases of women in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator for human rights in Paraguay has at least 37 cases, in which women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates, in Paraguay every ten days a woman died due to violence through men.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible abuse and a legal system that takes nothing</seg>
<seg id="2505">Before Mariana Brítez was the fixed girlfriend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that they called the name of all their former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">At the beginning, she didn't want to do that, but then, however, she should repent.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no more with Carlos; but two years long, she bore the psychic violence against women and one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severe recognizable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I have never thought that I would have been victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">If I have read it earlier, I always thought that only women happens to be submitting, because they let themselves go down from violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that I would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about the abuse by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without name, she wrote contributions on Facebook in which they described his insults and several attacks during their two-year relationship, and told how he had insulated them.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorisch, whether he ever raised the hand against them, and refused to be noted that his behavior was also a form of mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana, why they had fallen this so long by Carlos, and did not leave it earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least had a certain co blame.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, that originates from Paraguay, fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay, to prove that her former partner was harassed.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Yo CREO network ("I think you") that consists of women who are all in any way victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group, they can speak with others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do not do what many others do: they accept the statements of women.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything started with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her wealthy partner finally managed to convince her that she was valuable.</seg>

<seg id="2533">The original bill had intended to cost the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) processing costs, which have to endure the victims of violence even if they just want to report and receive a secure accomodation to the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Authenticauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not have sufficient financial funds to offer:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, mistreation is seen as part of interhuman relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here a change is to take place, that violence is no longer considered a little bit.</seg>

<seg id="2547">More than one year ago the Ottoman authorities closed an independent Italian newspaper Azamn due to its coverage of corruption in the Sultans.</seg>
<seg id="2548">Yousef Al-Haj, one of the editors of the newspaper, is still in prison where he was a prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Two other editors of Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari and Zaher Al-Abri, were also arrested and placed before the court, however later.</seg>
<seg id="2550">Oman has been ruled by Sultan Qabus ibn Said since 1970 when he came to power after he had appointed his father, Said ibn Taimur.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then he dressed in addition to his role as the only sultan, the most important offices in the country: Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The Ottoman occupation of the sultans is characterized by the efforts of security forces, in particular the national freedoms, including freedom of freedom, including press, independent journalists, blogger and other activists, intimidate and incarcerate.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The authorities restricting peace and legitimate activities in the field of human rights systematically and hints citizens, also activists, their views over the public affairs of the country such as corruption in authorities and institutions from both online and offline.</seg>
<seg id="2554">The attack on the newspaper Azamn, their closing and the imprisonment three of their editors in the last year is a hard blow for the Press Freedom in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2555">Azamn is an independent newspaper in which since its inception in 2007 on corruption in Oman (an absolute monarchy) was reported until it was forbidden by the authorities in August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2556">On July 28, 2016, security forces Ibrahim Al-Maamari, Chief of Chief of Azamn, published an article entitled "High Priority Parties to the Justice" newspaper on July 26, 2016. she went to corruption in the judicial law and the mixture of high-level civil servants.</seg>

<seg id="2576">The last closing of Azamn and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which in Oman at least the freedom of press was wounded.</seg>
<seg id="2577">For further violations, for example, the closure of the website of the independent magazine Mowatine and the exercise of pressure on albalad, the first independent online newspaper of the country, to carry out its operation.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Due to the continuous closing of Azamn and the imprisonment of journalists Al-Haj, the impression that the omic authorities are still not ready to prepare an extensive violation of the Press Freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2579">The Golf Centre for Human Rights (Gulf Centre for Human Rights, GCHR) calls for the omic authorities to:</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, picture will take place with his understanding of understanding</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is only rare or not mentioned in the media. this is a growing range, which addresses one of the most urgent requirements of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research on site: a lack of medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Illnesses such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have more serious effects in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment for the research of these diseases caused by pharmaceutical markets are a great problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research, which is carried out by African scientists, is helping to develop its own research capacity in Africa. a major role of science and technology can only be eligible for the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warriors is director of the Central Committee on the Centre for Exploration disorders in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in the 1990s in Lusaka, Zambia, just when the AIDS epidemic had the first serious impact on the national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a Postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he researched the HIV virus, before he decided to go back home to support the samic health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warriors discussed about the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstanding of media on these research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(Disclaimer: Dr. Warriors says as a private people).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research issue?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work on the application of research results. I support the samic national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I just launch a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">Gv: what are your opinion according to the important recent science topics in your country and general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there are no basic research here. we only rely on solutions that have been developed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This must change, otherwise we will always stay the receiver instead of yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2605">Solutions that we get are often usable in our area, and sometimes it is impossible to use it here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">Gv: where does the financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult it is to find appropriate scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are funded differently well.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to return or go here, because financing and development chances are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Gv: how is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">Which obstacles are there in your routine research work which you didn't have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure is not equal to standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">Gv: how is the opinion of public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there are already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would propose that critical thinking and scientific methods are taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Gv: how big is your opinion according to the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they focus on, and how can we support development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I've seen great students of all age groups.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is demand for special scientific training, beginning at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, research of the space, healthcare (non-transferable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Gv: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as scientists in Africa over Western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often, it is the limited speed to do things, and the hard access to scientific expertise that would display here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that magazines are only accessible against payment (the so-called "Paywall"), also limited the amount of available information and speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">"" "from the United States to India: how" "" "open source" "" "seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This post by Rachel Cernansky appeared initially on the Ensia.com website, a magazine presenting on solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been educated in the United States since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties, like an example outredness, the first plant which has been cultivated by NASA astronauts in space and has devoured.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Almost 20 years of mortons, mortons, work only through its own indemnity, and the question as many salaries, he can have set limits.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But in the beginning of the 2000s, he noticed that more salads were patented and that he could not be able to resolve them.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only for individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special Rotor or Green-Green leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years more such patents have been applied to more plants such as grain or cartons. due to this trends, plant breeders, environmenters and experts for food safety ensure the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia of ancient tradition, Morton still dies a salad, however, he needs longer than ever since his work is becoming more tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it is, than in a river a boulders lies around whom I must make faddling." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">So we must now do that, but it is a breaking with the breeding tradition, "says he." I think this patents have to go to Salads.</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand before the court, there is no one more new salads, because all characteristics are already patented. "he makes it as good as possible and try to figure out those characteristics that he would like.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very careful and endeavoured to use no material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He also joined a movement that is always bigger in the USA and everywhere in the world: open source Breeding ("Open Source" trains).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have been cultivated and eaten red tube salads in the "greenhouse" of the station. there it has been tested as plants can be cultivated in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It's no coincidence that this name sounds rather than the movement would come from the IT area and not from the range of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (Initiative for "Open Source" seeds) can be inspired by the move for free "Open Source" Software which provide alternatives to protected by copyright software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was founded in order to ensure that some plant species and genders are not being protected as intellectual property and can be used for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, briefly Ossi, US breeders could agree that others can use them with them cultivated by them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This does not mean that they do not continue to make business with their seed, and can sell it. "open source" breeders allow for others to cross their seed, to cross their own varieties, and it is not immediately sufficient - two aspects which are prohibited by many plants.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Greater prospects for prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">For emergencies from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi member, Jack Kloppenburg are control of seed and the possibility of breeding new plants, both for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seeds plays a role in greater collateral such as biodiversity, rights of peasants, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or just little, by breeding seed with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">The Kloppenburg emphasises that the "open-source" movement do not work with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, corn, genetically modified or not, from organic agriculture, or does not need to buy food products in the global agricultural industry, whose youngest examples are offered to buy food markets, such as it is offered on peasmarkets, should also know that this species is bred and threatened as such vegetables.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Nutrition sovereign without seed integrity is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative undertake to provide other their seeds at their disposal. thus, in contrast, their intention is to be patented in contrast, seeds and plant features.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo from Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporter argued that the future of food supply is endangered because the available gene pool due to the increasingly numerous Intellectual Property Rights on plant material, which is therefore always restricted to unceasing.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, Executive Director of Ossi, has worked in her PhD thesis with genetic variation on carrots and their availability. she found out that approximately one-third of all cartographies are protected as intellectual property, making it suitable for plant breeders either not or less is usable.</seg>
<seg id="2659">There is still such estimates for other plants, but experts such as Luby believe that massactic plants are patented as wheat in still greater style as wheat or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A Question of Visibility</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are usually bred that they have targeted features - of such that their taste or its color improves up to such, due to them thrive in certain environments such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders through increasingly more patents. however, genetic diversity is currently necessary than ever before, since the changed conditions are worse by climate change much worse.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto spokesperson Carly Scaduto believes that genetic diversity is generally important and also decisive for Monsantos activities. with a total of four genbanks and cooperation with institutions such as the Agricultural Ministry of the United States, the company will use the preservation of genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">However, she contradict that intellectual property tries to promote other breeders since "patents and the protection of plant variets innovations." a patent is basically adopted as soon as the patent expires.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come with another method of the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such a protection is not able to inhibits innovations, but promotes positive material and know-how to public. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton requires different innovations to wait for another 20 years until a patent begins, but certainly no innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait for such a long time, they have been adapted to plants that have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you would have lost the struggle.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The major argument for Morton, however, that genetic resources have always been a general good and continue to remain: "independent plant breeders have neither the time still the money for such formalities, and monetely incentives are not attractive for us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make farmers their work.</seg>
<seg id="2671">This is it possible to write us, and it's impossible to use us if we do not continue to use the best and latest genetic resources. "</seg>
<seg id="2672">In all, Morton does not disturb the concept to patented the plant features: "we do not really use the features itself.</seg>
<seg id="2673">Plants form them themselves and as breeders, we finally have no idea how the plants do it.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant care in the US state of Oregon and Ossi member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "who is breeding, breeding his own values in them.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believes in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, are necessary to produce herbicide herbicide which are cultivated in its varieties in agriculture in its varieties.</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is perfect. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized enterprises (such that move to international markets, but smaller than for example Monsanto are) patents, even without being able to survive - either reject the patenting or they keep it for too expensive and therefore not worth it or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeders Frank Morton looks at his breeding garden Salate.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also the view that breeders would be innovative by the Avoid of plant patent: "it looks like that, as I can produce new effort to produce new releases, stronger than companies.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I need to get new material for my catalog because I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years ago, "says he." with a patent one is protected for 20 years before competition, with what makes it very nice easy to make. "worldwide resonance</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the United States seem to be a leader in the "Open Source" breeding, but the concept itself rises quickly around the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture") describes itself as professional organisation in the area of resources, an "open-source" seed-plant based on farmers and helps them develop new varieties that meet particular requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports it to come to "Open Source" seeds and to sell your own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German Organisation Agreement operates at an "open-source" license which ultimately became a formal and legally binding form of Ossi's obligation for breeders in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(regulations for breeding differ from the country to country, as well as the Ossi obligation not simply can be taken one into one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the executive executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally cultivated plants should not be patented. thus it speaks for the current practice of the European Patent Office that allowed patents to conventionally cultivated plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">However, there is no law; now it is on the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference on "Open Source" seed systems in Ethiopia, on farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, non-governmental organizations and seed companies from all East Africa to learn about the "open source" seed movement and the global trend towards the patentability of seeds.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' program for "Open Source" seed systems that the organization currently should establish a worldwide alliance for "Open Source" seed systems, which should be scheduled for scheduled next year.</seg>
<seg id="2692">A merger from environmental protection and development groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit development organisation USC Canada and the Action Group on erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map.</seg>
<seg id="2693">In September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the global alliance for the future of the food - a ban and help companies such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others - represents a report that farmers need to be able to exchange and improve the seed policy, so that a stable supply can be ensured by food.</seg>
<seg id="2694">In the report, the importance of a varied, local supply with seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection between the Lui of Ossi hopes it hopes to realize him soon more people.</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the newest goals of the censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">To unlock the Egyptian authorities in the internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a columnists.</seg>
<seg id="2723">At the weekend of 05th August the Egyptian government filed the website of the "Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network published an opinion on Facebook in which it criticised the Egyptian authorities for this step and continued to continue efforts and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The "Network for Human Rights Information Forks in spite of this attack and the Constitution, who wants to defend this goal in this part of the world to allow freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world, so it was never so important as now. ANHRI, it was never so important as now. ANHRI, it was never so important to overcome them to overcome the lock and not readmit. we hope to meet our task.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is regarded as the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt, after the authorities blocked more than two months 21 websites, such as the independent news page MADA Masr, arabic-lingual issue of the Huffington Post and the Al Jazeera "network of congenital" support of terrorism.

<seg id="2728">Besides ANHRI, there's no access in Egypt's blog and human rights abuses Ahmed Gamal Ziada.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for spreading column and articles that he writes in Egypt not accessible websites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">"" "" "" "the blog, whom he set up to circumvent the Egyptian government to avoid the goal of an attack." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger who has been native to the Ziadas blog, however, is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photo journalist, spent almost 500 days in captivity, after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he participated in the student's police, and performed a video about the police physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His article are mainly turning around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook review, Ziada donated to the blocking of the government and reflecting what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">Those, blogs to unlock is very old, but has priority to me in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi. and even if the blocking of blogs may not be meaningful for the world, it is it for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It succeeded to give me the feeling of a siege to mediate, an arrest, an alleged murder, precharge at the National Security Council, the blocking of blogs, and any other website, for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I wrote not in vain. in other words, my words have influence, if only one small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to the post of articles to get the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Now, after they have blocked him, and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The mud go the way up to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE), Egyptian authorities closed from 24 May to 06 August 133 pages. this gave technical tests into the networks of various Internet Service Provider (ISP), including orange, Vodafone and Etan.</seg>
<seg id="2743">AFTE also documented the blocking of providers that was possible through the implementation of Internet encensorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in their research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday the 12th of June we noticed how the wave of websites that VPNs appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice indicates the intention of government to block content to block content and might have access to the Egyptian users.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In addition, the situation will be worsened that the censer decisions can be met behind closed doors, thus reducing the Egyptian population does not have legal basis to advance against this actions.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the censorship and whom will it be next to attack?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants fight.</seg>

<seg id="2753">Day for day report newspapers in Brazil with popular headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcards.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"" "" "" "14-year-old shot at school" "" "every second day a police officer murdered in Rio de Janeiro" "", "" "" "Diieves harps 8500 soldiers of the army, Marine and Air Baltic to Rio" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the middle of the economic crisis and in an anted financial situation, the Violence 2017 in Rio reached the highest stand for 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The United Nations's Brazilian non-governmental organisation called the United Nations to access the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports such as these are all daily and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"" "thus, the detailed report on violence in Rio known newspaper" "" "Extra" "" "on 16 August is not normal" "", "in which she announced to set a new section called" "" "War in Rio" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports of violence in the city will now be published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The motifs for their decision declared the newspaper so:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report about crimes reported in any major city on the world as murder, robb, sexual crimes, etc. everything that happens from the civil standard, and what only happens in Rio, will be published in the heading "War in Rio." (...) This is our way to call: that's not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative, that we may not exclude our eyes in front of the grave.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video that was shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedean, the editor of the newspaper, said that this decision is not a reason for pride, but rather a sign of failure to be:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper across the world with a war bark in a country that doesn't recognize the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video a journalist announced that according to the details of the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro, 843 territories there are responsible for criminal organizations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial article the newspaper writes:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, when it is distorted to be used, Grausages of the police, which just shoots and then questions to decor.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose goal is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the name "war" fails to get more than it?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil argued the journalist in Cecília Oliveira, to describe violence as "war." this is their opinion according to a justification of failed security policy through the media and could make it more difficult, Responsible for the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is no war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and worse planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of the military interest rates in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel, enlightenment, and an historical and self-neglecting of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">Reminder: the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2777">According to Cecília, Rio de Janeiro is false: "22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil, according to statistics from 2015, are located in the north and north east of the country. these are the most recent data available.</seg>
<seg id="2778">No such cities is in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">If we watch the Mordrates in the state, Rio is on No.16, "writes her.</seg>
<seg id="2780">Extra belongs to the company Globo, the largest media company of South America, emphasised as Cecília, since years the State policy of the State.</seg>
<seg id="2781">To these safety measures, the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia, ficadora), one from the state of Rio in 2003, was one of the police unit whose goal is to conquer a Favela by deployment and a unit permanently.</seg>
<seg id="2782">At the beginning, this actually led to a decrease in forcible deaths. for some years, the UPP could actually protect about Schicans and repression against the poor congregations, who actually should protect the neugely police unit, increasingly on fuss.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, the journalist João Paulo Charleaux made from an article published in 2010, in which he declares, why the violence in Rio did not correspond to the criteria of "Civil War" by the Geneva Convention.</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal issues, the classification of the location in Rio is considered serious consequences for people to themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2786">For this demands the state to use funds and ways which are typical for war. in addition, the entry into the territory of a "enemy," which is a sharp point in the countryside, and for the object for "collateral damages" and "spelled spheres."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War or her, fact is that the inhabitants of the Favelas continues to suffer in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="2788">One week it is now that the police seized the mountain with the Favela Jacarezinho to avenge the death of a policemen.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence, this incident also made headlines: an orderer died as a result of shots who had fired the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2873">In a night in the autumn of 1994, the conquest of Afghanistan began through the Taliban.</seg>
<seg id="2874">Two years ago, a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mujahedin group, which had defeated the short-lasting pro-Soviet government. so Afghanistan became a country of terror and despair.</seg>
<seg id="2875">Just at that time, Asharaf Barati, a 13-year-old boy, who belongs to the ethnic group of Hazara, in the province of Ghazni at the last time with his family together with dinner.</seg>
<seg id="2876">Even if his mother then did not say then, she knew that she would not see her son much longer - maybe even more.</seg>
<seg id="2877">The boy should break the boy in the morning.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of the Party of Hazara dominant party Hezb-e-Wahdat was just murdered by Taliban, and many Hazara felt suddenly protection.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban kicked closer and closer to the hazard-known Taliban.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">Some days after his escape, Asharaf found himself in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">In a few years he worked in a cohabrube. the work was heavily and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took this, which was left of his small wages, and went into Iran. once again he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and towing sacks with mortars, which were heavier than himself to earn his living.</seg>
<seg id="2890">Back then, as today, the lives of Afghan refugees in Iran was minted by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," said Asharaf in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the building site, which we worked on.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services there and no heating. we put nylon in front of the open window, that we do not cancel the night at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf left his life without papers in Iran, and made ready for travel to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">In the dangerous crossing on the sea, he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, inhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities had rejected his asylum request, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">A few days was Asharaf homeless, running alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed twice on the day of food to help needy families.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy is due to relatively high growth rates, a kind second chance for expired asylum seekers. however, it is true that the conditions of asylum seekers in the country are catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="2898">The Human Rights organisation Alliberties Union for Europe writes the system "suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">The vast majority of asylum seekers is housed in the more than 3000 "special recording centres." this is an improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared staff. "</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to Italian Law, asylum seekers can be allocated to a recording center if they have officially granted a request for asylum - which can still go for months after the registration of the asylum request.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who have no money for an apartment, either drawn to the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it came to Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his uncontingent of life helped Asharaf who soon release them out of these conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After spending several years in the construction industry several years, Asharaf made his whole exploration in the establishment of a hostels in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This was so good that he still opened a second hostel for a while and a snapshot.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis success story is now the theme of the "handicapped Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (german: "behind the Venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") of the director Amin Wahidi.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italian - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">A lot of bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to unofficial estimates, about 20,000 Afghanistan live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them the country is a transition solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Over the past few years, some of Afghanistan produced companies, including cutting, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even blessed in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea about his restaurant Oriental Experience in which the waiter and the kitchen staff were mainly refugees from various parts of the world.</seg>
