this is James R@@ isen .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as New York Times re@@ por@@ ters .
long before someone heard of Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he published more spectacular , that the N@@ SA was illegal teleph@@ ones of Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astroph@@ ic US intelligence service operation in which the CIA was literally cul@@ min@@ ated for a nuclear bomb .
if the crazy sounds , you can read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know whom the chapter did not right ?
the U.S. government .
for almost 10 years the government has established the government against R@@ isen , and called upon him to call his alleged sources .
in this train , he became the symbol of the government to condemn W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and to bes@@ p@@ ate journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not receive this information and can &apos;t protect the identity of the Mu@@ ch .
so , when the government of R@@ isen was done , he did something that many bra@@ ve re@@ por@@ ters did before him , and he refused , and said that he would prefer to go to prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen lived so with the risk to go to prison .
but then , just days before the process , something unusual .
suddenly , although they were present for years that it had been indisp@@ ens@@ able for their case , the demands of the government were dropped to R@@ isen .
the reason : during the period of electronic monitoring the re@@ por@@ ters and sources can always hide less .
rather than to be ashamed and r@@ isen on statements , this might also do his digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so , the investig@@ ator , without his consent , his telephone numbers would be wor@@ ried about ,
just as its e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , its lending information , and even travel links with the list of its flights .
in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling , a CIA @-@ W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower source .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
President Obama talked to protect W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower , but instead , the justice condem@@ ns him more than all US governments before him .
now you can imagine how to be a problem , especially because the government is too much of their work as secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national safety was the result that a W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower came to a journalist .
so , we are looking forward to the press team that should be protected by the first constitutional requirement , because the government has more possibilities to send out all .
but just as the technology of the government allowed to handle the rights of rep@@ aid , the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better .
and indeed they can contact them from the moment in which they contact , instead of the afternoon , in the testimony .
today there are communications software that had not been written as R@@ isen had written a book , and it is much more secure than normal e @-@ mails or telephone calls .
one such technology is Secure@@ Drop , an open @-@ source trans@@ mitt@@ ment system for W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , which has been developed by us from the Freedom of the Press Foundation , which I have been working .
instead of send an e @-@ mail , go to a news website , such as the Washington Post .
there you can also upload documents or information , as with any ordinary contact form .
these will then be encrypted and stored on a server , which only has the respective News Agency .
so the government can &apos;t work out more information , and many of the information that would request , would not be available from the event .
Secure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole , to protect the press status in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments of the world are always developing new sp@@ y technologies that all end@@ anger@@ ed us .
it &apos;s sure to ensure that not only technology companies such as Edward Snow@@ den give an opportunity to overcome mis@@ eries . it is just as important that we protect the next W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower ,
the dis@@ counted of abuse during the supply of soldiers knows and over@@ crow@@ ded in the hospitals . or the next environmental workers , the alarm to the se@@ wage water of Fl@@ int . or a Wall@@ st @-@ Insider that war@@ ns us before the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies have not only been made for those who want to un@@ cover crimes , but to protect our constitutional rights .
thanks . thank you .
&#91; 3 April 2016 &#93; the largest data of the history was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; reveal that the rich and M@@ igh@@ ts@@ man of Global Wit@@ ness , &#91; what does this mean ? &#93; this week we were submitted by news about a L@@ eck of 11 million documents of the law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ se@@ ca
publication of these documents provides a small insight into the secret world of the tax ha@@ v@@ ases .
we will get an impression of what customers , banks and lawyers will go to companies such as Mos@@ cow@@ Fon@@ se@@ ca and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you agree ? &quot;
we actually see the e @-@ mails , exchange messages , as the whole system works , as it works .
this has already taken very direct consequences .
Iceland became prime minister .
there are also reports that one ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad Cor@@ respon@@ ds affiliated companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ases .
it is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin leads to a close friend from pedi@@ atri@@ ations , a famous C@@ elli@@ sts .
now there will be a lot of rich people and others who wait more nerv@@ ous to the next publication , and the next reveal documents .
now it sounds like the plot &apos;s plot , or a John @-@ Gr@@ ish@@ am novel .
it seems cri@@ es away from you , me , unusual men .
why should we do that ?
but the truth is : if the rich and mighty are in the situation , their assets are to hide and not all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as healthcare , education , roads .
and this concerns us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these re@@ vel@@ ations are phenom@@ enal .
in all over the world , media and leading politicians , such as secret control phases of some few will be used to hide and closed their fortune -- something that we have been discus@@ sing for ten years .
I think many people will find this whole world very conf@@ using , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ases will work .
I always set it to me like a Mat@@ ri@@ jo@@ sch@@ en@@ cap@@ e .
so , one company in another company , in another company which makes it almost impossible to understand , who is behind these bones .
it may be very difficult for criminal prosecution and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what thing is .
I think it is interesting that there are less reports about this matter in the USA .
probably because there have been no prominent Americans that came in these ab@@ brevi@@ ations , this sc@@ and@@ al .
well , it is not so that there is no rich Americans that hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ases .
however , by the principle that these control phases work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ se@@ ca has less American customers .
would we have a data of the Cay@@ man Islands , or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see a lot more cases and examples that have connections in the United States .
in fact , it is so that in some US states you need to specify less information , to establish a company than to get a library card .
this kind of in@@ transparency in the U.S. has allowed to settle for school children to school children .
it has been allowed to zoom particularly vulner@@ able brackets .
it is this kind of behavior , which affects us all .
here , at Global Wit@@ ness , we wanted to find out how all this in practice would like .
how does it work ?
so we sent a conce@@ aled investig@@ ator into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator gave himself as African ministers , to bring the susp@@ ects money into the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
it really sho@@ cked us that all , except for a lawyer to our investig@@ ator , how he could transfer his money .
these were all prec@@ urs@@ or . none of these lawyers participated as clients , and of course no man was handed over to the money . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider this not as a single occasion .
it does not work for a single advoc@@ ate , who gave to our covered investig@@ ator suggestions .
it does not move around a single top pol@@ iti@@ y , wrapped in a sc@@ and@@ al .
it goes , as the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability can be established .
and to handle it , we must change the rules .
we must change the rules to make this type of behavior .
it may sound everything very fast , as if we could do nothing against it , as if nothing could have changed ever ; as if there is always the rich and mighty .
but as a safe optim@@ ist I see that some things have begun to change .
in the last few years we have seen suggestions to more transparency , which concerns the owners of companies .
the subject took political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron to the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
since then , the EU is represented in central regi@@ sters at national level , who is really behind companies in Europe , and who controls them .
one of the un@@ pleasant facts is that the USA falls below .
representatives of both parties have brought a bill in both parliamentary chambers but this does not make the progress that we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama re@@ vel@@ ations , this huge insight into the world of the tax ha@@ v@@ ases , used as a means to ensure more transparency in the US and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for changes .
we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their real identity behind projector companies .
we need managers in the economy to rise and say , &quot; In@@ transparent is not good for business . &quot;
we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it through laws this type of in@@ transparent .
together , we can finally termin@@ ate the in@@ transparent , which now makes this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing .
this is the story , as I was almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk by a red Maz@@ das .
one day after I finished my design studies , I made a deposit sale .
a type in the red Maz@@ da remained and looked at my mind .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was in the city alone and took a road@@ journey through the whole country . after that he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me excited about how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I got tired .
when we paid the bill , I made the error to ask : &quot; where do you sleep this day ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he even got worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I thought : &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got him yet to know ! he says he would go to peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really planning it . I don &apos;t have been ab@@ duc@@ ted in the boot of a Maz@@ das land !
that is a small luggage compartment !
then I heard me say , &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; h how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the night I was in bed , I star@@ red on the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what have I been involved in me ?
a wild bo@@ oms in my living room .
what if he is crazy ? &quot;
I got such fear that I got up out of the bed , on a tenth at a door and completed my bedroom door .
but he was not crazy .
we are still in touch .
the artwork , which he had bought from me is today in his class@@ room . he is a teacher .
that was my first experience as hosts . it has completely changed my viewing angle .
perhaps the people who were sold in childhood were sold as strangers , actually friends who only were waiting for them to be discovered ?
people caught on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress .
let &apos;s make a jump , two years later ...
I &apos;m working unemployed , almost ple@@ ite , my roomm@@ ates and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I believe that creativity can make it , anxi@@ ety in fun .
I wrote my best friend and new roomm@@ ates Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I have over@@ lay how we could earn something . our apartment will stay on a designer @-@ bed @-@ and @-@ breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a writing desk , including a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a web site and founded &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three fortun@@ ate guests were allowed to sleep for $ 20 on the air mattress on wood floor .
they loved it , and we also loved .
I am sure our cheese ham cream cheese is completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . as we passed our last guest , and the door fell into the castle , rigid Brian and I joined us .
had we just discovered that we could find new friends and could pay our rent ?
things came to rolls .
my former fellow @-@ people , n@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ c@@ zy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out whether they could make a business concept .
so we presented the investors : &quot; we want to create a website , on which people publicly po@@ urs out their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms , whose doors are coming when you come over .
over the Internet you can download the foreign people to stay with them .
that &apos;s the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited that the miss@@ ile would ign@@ iter .
but did it not .
no one who is still full of comfort , would invest in a store that allowed strangers to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because we have lear@@ nt all lear@@ nt that strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , one can be used on things that can be good . we were able to design .
at the Academy of Fine Arts , we learned that design is much more than just appearance and h@@ ap@@ tics -- it is the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create great confidence by design , between people who had never met before .
can design aff@@ ord something ?
is it possible to create with design confidence ?
I would like to give you a sample , what grade we commit .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it is out of your comfort .
thum@@ bs up if you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I would like to try to un@@ lock your cell phone .
enter your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left seat post .
this silent flight of pan@@ ic , which you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts will , if she open the door the first time .
for the only thing that is still personal as your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the locked mobile phone of a stranger in the hands ?
most feel the responsibility .
so the most guests will feel when they can stay somewhere else .
only for this reason our company can exist .
only one time , who actually has Al Go@@ res Mobile Phone ?
could you declare to Twitter , that it is responsible for the Office of the President ?
you can return the phone off right now .
you have experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I want to tell you some discover@@ ies .
what would , if we have changed a little detail on this experiment ?
what if your neigh@@ bor had first appeared only once with his name , if he tells whence he comes from whence he comes , how his dog or his children be called ?
imagine , you had 150 Be@@ ads , who say : &quot; he can really hold un@@ locked cell@@ phones ! &quot;
how would you feel when you would have to leave your cell phone ?
because a well @-@ covered feedback system strengthens trust .
at the beginning we have done some things wrong .
it was difficult for people to dis@@ able negative ass@@ ess@@ ments .
ultimately , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had submitted their ess@@ ments before we introduced them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we performed with Stan@@ ford a study . we examined how likely it is that people should trust in one another , depending on how they are similar to age and residence .
little sur@@ pris@@ ingly , we trust the people most , which are the most similar .
the more differences we find , the less confidence we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it is exciting if you add to the call of a person - in our case by ass@@ ess@@ ments .
if one has less than three distribution departments , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation of all simil@@ ar@@ ities .
so the right design can help us to overcome some of our deep roots .
we also heard that confidence depends on it , how much man is there .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
if one tells you too little , how to &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you get no answer .
one tells you much , as for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request is also not accepted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so there is an optimal degree of open@@ ness , e.g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great works of art in your dwelling ! I do with my family holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how to create it with design to make this degree of open@@ ness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips to which topics should be explained .
our whole company builds on hope that the right design may help to overcome our inheritance from strangers .
as we had not counted , the great amount of people who were more than willing to take these deposits .
here you see how many people take our offer .
you can recognize three things .
first : incredibly good luck .
second : the ti@@ reless work of our team .
third : a demand that had not been bred before .
the business is very good for us .
of course there are times when not smooth running .
there were guests who are not allowed to have been devast@@ ated parties or dwellings .
hosts have guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked on customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front front when it was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it &apos;s already hurt when I just remember it .
the dis@@ appointment that hear in the voice of the call@@ ers , and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve us .
lu@@ ck@@ ily , a fra@@ ction of 123 million , only a fra@@ ction has a problem .
for people confi@@ ded to each other .
if it works , we can do won@@ dro@@ us works .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay and suffered a heart attack there .
his hosts drove him into the hospital .
he even got blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for trav@@ ellers who tend to vent@@ ric@@ ular activities due to sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
Javier and Ale@@ j@@ and@@ ra are real protection gel that save a life even though they don &apos;t know correctly .
you drive a car in the hospital when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want to feel lon@@ ely , they bring books .
you can even stay longer , without charge the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
of course not every stay expi@@ res .
but these relations behind pure cash flows are exactly what you want to reach with the Share economy .
when I came on this concept for the first time , I asked :
how does the idea of money with cash transactions fit together ?
it is about a economic trade here .
but just &apos; s &apos; s &apos; right now , the matter will not be justified .
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people imagine a part of oneself open , and that changes .
if you travel today , it is efficient and reliable , but it is efficient and reliable , but it is less authentic .
what if travelling is a rich buffet from local op@@ press ?
what would be , if at any place you visit , a group there would wait to fill a group there and show a pent@@ ag@@ pent@@ our neighborhood of which one has never heard ;
or if you have to learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what would if we would like to tell the apartments of the reason ?
what would that look like ?
what would , if cities would take advantage of the common share ?
I present cities in front of which we offer society and relationships , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and fir@@ ing .
in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking places , which belonged to the government ,
the residents were offered now . students who were searching for a stay ,
were convey@@ ed by people whose children had gone out . incub@@ ator programs have been started ,
in order to finance new start @-@ ups in Share economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85 000 people will be guest in 191 countries for a stranger or even host .
the idea seems so that it was not so crazy about how it was brought to us .
we didn &apos;t re@@ invented the wheel .
hospitality was also available before .
there have been similar websites in front of us .
so why did our work now ?
apart from luck and timing we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of confidence .
design can help us to overcome deep root parts .
I find it bl@@ ossom ,
stun@@ n@@ ingly long .
I have to think about it , if a red Maz@@ da goes on me .
we know of course that design cannot solve every problem .
but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use the design soon .
thanks . thank you .
what do you think if you watch me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
is supp@@ ressed or supp@@ ressed , a bra@@ ins have under@@ gone a terror ?
or simply a delay on security check at the airport .
this is true true .
I don &apos;t give you the bl@@ ame for your negative impressions .
for example , the media that look like me look like .
a study revealed that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims are negative .
studies show : Americans think most of those would not know any Muslims .
presumably the people do not speak with their U@@ ber drivers .
to all those who have never learned a Muslim : it is great to meet you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee wife -- Double Esp@@ res@@ so , with cream extra .
I am stra@@ cted ,
a se@@ ag@@ ull @-@ fitness fan@@ ati@@ cian ,
and I am a practic@@ ing , spiritual Muslims .
but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , for , baby , I was not born so .
I decided to do it .
when I was 17 , I met the decision to ou@@ ched me .
no , not as a hom@@ osexual man , as some of my friends , but as Muslims . I decided to wear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my fem@@ inist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why are you op@@ pressed yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the L@@ ust@@ em was : at that time it was a fem@@ inist Declaration of Independence , and opposite the pressure that I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old felt to adapt to a perfect and un@@ achiev@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Kor@@ an .
I read it , thought then , turned into question , doub@@ ted and believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was confidence and slow dev@@ otion which deep@@ ened with each reading of the Kor@@ an .
the beauty of the rhyth@@ ms bring me to wine .
I know myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
did you ever feel the feeling that som@@ eb@@ ody takes you , you are completely under@@ stand@@ able , and yet somehow he loves ?
it feels like that .
later I married and began , as all the good Egyptians , my career as engineers .
I had later , after my marriage , a child , and was basically the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American dream . &quot;
then the aw@@ ful morning came in September 2001 .
many of you remember exactly where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked on the screen and saw the word &quot; Express &quot; . &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ crafts flew in buildings , people sp@@ ans from the buildings .
what was this ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock turned fast in indig@@ nation .
why should I do something ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I switched to the television channel and heard : &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terror@@ ists ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh , my God .
it is not just my land attacked , but in the N@@ u eng@@ ed me the actions of others by a citizen in a susp@@ ects .
on that same day , we had to go through the Middle west of the USA to move into a new city and begin with the post@@ graduate studies .
I remember how I drove -- as we keep silent -- so deep it went into my seat , and I feared the first time when Muslims were recognized .
we moved to our apartment in this night , in a new town where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then I heard that I read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organizations which said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sei@@ d carefully &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not lead in well lit &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; they are not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
then , there was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather themselves together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the war@@ nings : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not work on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
the feelings were mist@@ ak@@ ted , and I heard of attacks on Muslims or of people who stayed for Muslims , went into free and struck .
there were really bran@@ dan@@ ces at mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something felt really felt right .
because people who attacked this country , have attacked our country .
I w@@ ished the rage of people on the terror@@ ists .
imagine ! I was angry also .
it is not easy to explain himself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
there are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
today , we can say that people can say : &quot; there is a problem in this land -- it means Muslims .
when will we go on ? &quot;
some people want to close Muslims and mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as one tumor in the body of the United States .
it &apos;s only the question : are we p@@ onder@@ ing or res@@ cu@@ ed ?
you know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor can be removed as a whole and a res@@ cu@@ ous tumor just under observation .
the alternatives are po@@ int@@ less because the question is wrong .
Muslims are , like all other Americans , no tumor in the body of the USA , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , hei@@ fer and Olympi@@ on@@ ers .
will the closing of mos@@ ques America be safe ?
there will be a few parking , but not stop the terror .
regular visit of a mosque helps people to consider other faith toler@@ ant , and to show greater participation .
and as a leader of the police in the Washington area , D.C. recently told , people are actually not al@@ izes in mos@@ ques .
they are ra@@ zed in their cellar or bed in front of a computer .
it has been noted that it begins online . when the person is cut off from their church , the veter@@ ans can do so that the person believes that the person believes that the terror@@ ists are ab@@ h@@ ing the true Muslims , and everyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behavior and ide@@ ology is ab@@ out@@ dated or by faith .
if we want to prevent Radi@@ alization , we must stop the people to go to the Mos@@ que .
some will still say that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group of how is IS out@@ breeding with the Kor@@ an .
as a Muslim , as a man , think I think we must do everything to stop a group as the IS .
but we would like to put us to their pre@@ ference , when they recogn@@ ise it as a representative of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS had so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Kl@@ ux @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups asser@@ t their ide@@ ology reasons behind their &quot; Holy book . &quot;
but if you cast a look at it , they do not drives what they are in her &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot;
it is its brut@@ ality that they can read these things into the scriptures .
an outstanding im@@ am telling me a amazing story :
a girl came to him , because they were silent to join the IS .
I was surprised and asked him if they had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was just the opposite . everyone who spoke to her , brought her to silence , and told her that her anger , her sense of un@@ righteousness in the world , it would only be in trouble .
nothing inspired and something that would have been given to their gro@@ ove , it was a main goal for the instrum@@ ent@@ alisation of extrem@@ ists who spoke to a solution .
this Im@@ am turned the connection to God and their church .
rather than to acc@@ use them for her rage , he showed their constru@@ ctive ways for a real change in the world .
what she met in the mosque , she tried to join the IS .
that was an insight , as the Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia suffered me and my family .
but how does it affect the normal Americans ?
how does it work on any other ?
how does the 24 hour consumption of fear every day affects our democracy ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies - show : if we fear us , at least three things happen .
we rather accept an author@@ itarian system system , conformity and other parts .
a study shows : if one reports test persons , in which negative about Muslims were reported , they voted in more military attacks on Muslim lands as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just a academic problem .
if you look when the tuning against Muslims were shot upwards - between 2001 and 2013 -- this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in advance of the Iraq War and during two election periods .
so the Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror , as I expected it .
it is actually a tool to manip@@ ulate the public in order to under@@ mining the foundation of a free society , sen@@ sible and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we might feel it as the first , but the toxic air of the fear of us all .
in the assignment of collective debt , it is not just about to explain himself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married pair that lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both were to school .
De@@ ah was an athl@@ ete .
he was in the dental fac@@ ulty , talented , promising her ...
his sister would say to me that he was the most generous man , who knew her .
she visited him there and he showed her life @-@ run . she was hop@@ ing and said :
&quot; when is such a young man from my breasts ? &quot;
just a few weeks after visiting Su@@ z@@ anne in her brother and his wife , her neigh@@ bor , Craig Stephen H@@ icks , murdered them , just as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was in the afternoon . he did in her flat as with a execution , after he was post@@ pon@@ ed against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he shot eight times to De@@ ah .
Fan@@ at@@ ism can not only be imm@@ oral , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
are we gone to the mosque or we stayed at home ?
we bes@@ ought it and for us it was no easy decision , because we want to let us leave our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can freely exercise our religion .
we chose for the mosque .
with our son in the nur@@ ser@@ y seat we were silent , with high pressure at the Mos@@ que .
I took him out , went out my foot@@ wear , went into the prayers , and what I saw , left me .
the hall was rest@@ less filled .
then the be@@ am made a announcement , than@@ ked and welcomed our guests , because the half of the gathered Christians were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hist@@ s , ath@@ eist@@ s , believers and non @-@ believers who had come , not to attack us but for us .
in that moment , I joined together .
these people were there , because they had the courage and compassion .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose from the moment of anxi@@ ety and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism ?
will you go on number safe ?
or will you join those who think : we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thank you very nice !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have a nerv@@ ous .
but I ask myself , what do you say that you &apos;re saying that you &apos;re a T@@ ED@@ Talk , a think of low @-@ speed work , i.e. an exception and not the rule .
what would you say about those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say that you don &apos;t know . I &apos;m completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is permitted .
when you look at the Muslims in all over the world , and I did this with the greatest of the study conducted among Muslims in all over the world , people want to normal things .
they want to be prosper@@ ity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am no exception in any respect .
if people like an exception to the rule , then the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to rule .
HW : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as platform for Bast@@ ers , just before it came to become a billion @-@ dollar store .
monitoring , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial thre@@ ats . this is made possible in research facilities worldwide .
before the air @-@ site transfer to our social consciousness , a autonomous fleet of flight machines at the Fra@@ c Centre in France has built a six metre high tower in front of the audience . some years ago , they began to fly with rop@@ es .
by connecting the machines speeds up high speed and acceleration in the smallest space .
you can also build sel@@ fl@@ able structures as well .
they have learned to carry loads to move with tur@@ bul@@ ences and respond to natural laws .
today we would like to show you a few of our new projects .
our aim is to exceed the limits of possible in an autonomous flight .
in order to work an autonomous system , it needs to know that mobile objects can be found in the space .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . that allows us to focus on developing dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new location technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space , calculations on board which should do the machine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external orders are available at the highest point e. g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
a flight device , which tries to beat two flying with a fl@@ ap .
like other Star@@ r@@ vol@@ gler , it is efficient , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all their variations .
in contrast to most of the starters , it can be bo@@ ar , and so great benefits at start and landing , and is very versatile .
but there is always a fli@@ p@@ side .
a restriction of rear lights is that they react sensitive to tur@@ bul@@ ence such as wind oils .
we develop new controllers and algorith@@ ms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flight device is no matter what the optimum position is recovered and the performance can be improved through practice .
okay .
during our research we often set fundamental abstract questions related to the core of the matter .
such a question would be for example : what is the smaller number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for this to know the answer to such a question .
helicopter are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that can be joined to viol@@ ate you .
decades ago trained pilots of remote @-@ driven flying devices , which had just two moving parts : a propeller and a rear sk@@ irt .
never long , we discovered that flying with only one works .
this is the Mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechanical sim@@ pl@@ est control unit . it was invented recently .
it has only one movable part , one propeller ,
no valves , hing@@ es and cross @-@ ru@@ ders , no further Stell@@ ated or control surfaces , only one propeller .
although it is mechanically simple , the inside live very much , so it can be stable , and can move in the room .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear . to bring it to flies , I must throw it exactly right .
the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood to throw it exactly right when all look on , is low , therefore I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening .
when the Mon@@ osp@@ inner is a practice in practice , this machine is here , the Omni@@ kop@@ ter with its eight pro@@ pane , one exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this excess ?
they see that he is just symmet@@ ri@@ cally .
therefore it is ambi@@ valent in his alignment .
in this way he gets the best ordinary ability ,
in the space to move in all directions , no matter in which direction it is turned or even as he rot@@ ates .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of eight prop@@ ellers .
a lot is obvious in models , the rest is lear@@ ns directly to fly .
we look forward to that .
when flying machines should be part of our everyday life , it must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine comprises two separate two @-@ propeller aircraft machines .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the other against clock@@ wise .
if you assemble them together , they are like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
however , something wrong - a motor or propeller is falling from , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly if also restricted .
we will demonstrate that , by half of course we are air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration was examined by synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression .
we took a commercial micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- every single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and st@@ out@@ fit them with loc@@ alis@@ ing technology and algorith@@ ms .
each unit knows where space is and sel@@ ects . therefore there is no upper limit .
hop@@ efully you can motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to develop new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine because the Broadway would like to be a flying lamp@@ holder to Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predi@@ ct the influence of this technology .
for types like us is the reward in the development and the work act .
it serves as a reminder , how wonderful and magical our universe is , and that it makes it creative , to form it in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive professional and economic potential , is the dot on the i .
thank you very much .
at 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes in a very far distant galax@@ y is always faster , they turned into the mass of three mer@@ ges in a ten @-@ second in pure energy .
this short moment they ligh@@ tened brigh@@ ter than all stars in all galax@@ ies of the entire universe .
it was a very big pop .
they didn &apos;t put their energy in form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was given into space @-@ time @-@ po@@ unding itself and explo@@ ded the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we arrange events at first time .
1.3 billion years ago , a majority life was created on earth .
since then , the Earth has brought a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , people , and -- God understand us even the internet .
about 25 years ago she decided to build a group of particularly cour@@ age@@ ous -- R@@ ai Weiss , MIT , K@@ IP Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver of C@@ alt@@ ech -- to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which arise approximately through colon@@ ating black holes .
most they kept for crazy .
but enough people recognized as crazy Gen@@ ies so that the US National Science Foundation has financed their idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely much hard work , they built the detector L@@ IG@@ O : the laser Inter@@ fer@@ omet@@ ry Gra@@ vit@@ ational Observatory .
in the following time , the precision of L@@ IG@@ O was increased significantly , which significantly improved the detection rate .
therefore it is called Advanced L@@ IG@@ O .
at the beginning of September 2015 L@@ IG@@ O was launched for a last test run in order to clari@@ fy some small hard drives .
on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two col@@ li@@ ating black holes removed through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hug@@ hes : only two moments in my life were emotional as this :
the birth of my daughter
and the goo@@ db@@ ye of my death @-@ sick father .
basically , the fruits of my life was basically .
all this , what I had worked , is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hug@@ hes , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been resear@@ ching gra@@ vit@@ ational signals for 23 years and their by ob@@ servatory such as L@@ IG@@ O measuring signals . but what are vit@@ ational waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational shaft is a change in the ge@@ other@@ space of space and time .
when passing the shaft , the room and its entire contents are stretched into a direction and cle@@ aring the other into the other .
to illustr@@ ate the do@@ z@@ ers of courses in cur@@ ses for the theory of rel@@ ativity often perform a really al@@ ber@@ ed dance .
&quot; stretching and dust , stretching and dust . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous .
on September 14 , for example , every one was stretched out at the waves of the waves , and the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average people was 10 to -@@ 21 .
that is called 20 zer@@ os according to the Com@@ ma , followed by a 1 . therefore the L@@ IG@@ O employees declared for crazy .
with a five kilometer long laser detector , and this is ab@@ sur@@ d , this length would have to be measured less than a thous@@ and@@ ths of a nuclear core . this is gr@@ ot@@ es@@ k .
at the end of his classical text about grav@@ itation
described K@@ IP Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder L@@ IG@@ Os , hunting according to the waves in the way : &quot; the technical difficulties of the construction of such detectors are extensive .
but physi@@ cist are dark and with the support to the public , all obstacles will be overcome . &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to L@@ IG@@ O . Scott claims that L@@ IG@@ O is more an ear than one eye .
I want to explain what this means .
the light has a wavelength , which is much smaller than the things about us around : fac@@ tor@@ ches , the size of your mobile phones .
that &apos;s quite practical . for so you can manufacture a picture or a map of things by taking off the about several points of coming light around you .
the other is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 metres .
therefore it is very hard , actually impossible to produce a picture of things , which mean you especially much :
the face of your child is approximately .
instead , we listen to certain characteristics such as clay and level , rhythm and volume to close to the history behind .
&quot; now Alice is talking about Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts them . &quot;
&quot; D@@ une Bob &quot; .
the same is true for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we can do with them any simple images of objects in all .
but by having regard to changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least the measured frequencies are at least for L@@ IG@@ O .
so if we convert wave pattern in sound , we can listen to the all literally .
the grav@@ itation to listen , we can betra@@ y us about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott are already busy very long .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , shine simply : w@@ up@@ p !
turn the two body very fast , you hear the same circulation with an additional sound change . that sounds like this : W@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u !
it is a type of course set , shaped into the wav@@ e@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date which at least I never forget -- heard L@@ IG@@ O the following : &#91; Sur@@ render sound &#93; J@@ ose who must hear what he must hear , det@@ ects this as sound by -- SH : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ fold sun@@ ba@@ the mass , which rotate around as quickly as the bars of your mixer .
AA : if we are briefly , what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in all , one with a mass of 29 tons , the other one with a mass of 36 tons , revol@@ ve each hundred times per second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we have heard it .
there are permanent importance of L@@ IG@@ O .
L@@ IG@@ O eb@@ net a fully new way to explore the universe , as it was never possible before .
on this way we can listen to the All and the In@@ visible .
and much in all , we can &apos;t see -- practically or basically -- no matter .
a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ tr@@ ench stars in super@@ nov@@ ae explo@@ de .
they are very useful . of them we have learned a lot about the All .
but the exciting physical processes are done in the core , which is hidden behind thousands of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never see , since these op@@ ak are .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are penet@@ rating iron , as it would be transparent glass . it would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it because the ur@@ ge is veil@@ ed by his own offspring .
with the help of gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , it should be possible until the beginning .
and probably the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that we have never seen in all things we have never seen , which we have never seen , and of whom we don &apos;t have any idea that we can discover by listening .
in fact L@@ IG@@ O appeared in the first attempt of things that we had not expected .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the L@@ IG@@ O project , says on this topic : ME : the kind of stars that produce black holes , such as L@@ IG@@ O they are observed , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient body from prehistoric times . the black holes are so to speak the Sau@@ ri@@ erk@@ no@@ chen for our archaeological work .
L@@ IG@@ O gives us a completely different viewing angle of the events in All , on the emergence of the stars and ultimately , as we went out of this chaos .
AA : the challenge is now to be as good as possible .
thanks to L@@ IG@@ O , we know how to build great detectors and qu@@ ench the cos@@ mos of the cos@@ mos .
we need ideas for new Ob@@ serv@@ atories -- a completely new generation of Ob@@ serv@@ atories on Earth and All .
for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the ur@@ ine ?
now the time is big dreams .
dreams about us with us .
thanks . thank you .
some time ago I tried to experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one year I would say to all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before I was afraid . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter whether it got me nerv@@ ous to me in un@@ pleasant situations , I forced me to say &quot; Yes &quot; .
did I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
do I want to be live on television ?
no , but yes !
wanted to start playing with the scene ?
no , no , no , yes , yes .
and a mad thing happened exactly what to do , w@@ ov@@ or I feared , failed my fears .
my fears , spe@@ ech@@ es , my social fear -- Pu@@ ff , gone .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes , &quot; he has changed my life .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain Yes , that changed my life to one un@@ expect@@ edly . it started with a question of my pet@@ itions .
I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , is called out of un@@ explained reasons . &quot;
in case she would be a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; estim@@ ation , I need milk for my be@@ ak @-@ asse . &quot;
she once asked , if I could play with her when I was just on the go . and I said , &quot; yes . &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
a new attitude of living in my family . from there I will swear again to play with them , as soon as you want to do with them . no matter what I am doing , or where I go , I say always Yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I &apos;m getting tired of me .
it has a magical effect on me , on my children , on our family .
but it also has an amazing side effects : just before short , I was entirely aware that the &quot; Yes &quot; -@@ S@@ ages to play with my children my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am author . I think about things , establish you to life .
dream job .
no . no .
I am a titanium .
dream job .
I create television . I book television .
I &apos;m doing television , in big style .
I am responsible for this TV @-@ season to carry out 70 hours of program into the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are available at the same time .
each broadcast provides hundreds of jobs that are not existing before .
the budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
a new episode of nine days , four shows , every nine days 20 million dollars , four TV programs , 70 hours of TV , three programmes available at the same time : 24 episodes : Sc@@ and@@ al , 15 episodes : Sc@@ and@@ al , 15 episodes : Sc@@ and@@ al , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours of television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America , my TV series will run on Thursday evening .
my series will run in 256 languages for 30 million viewers across the world .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are ship@@ ments that I have created themselves , and not only produced , so I have to find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fires and tell my stories .
four television series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires that burn around the world .
do you know who makes it ?
no one , this is why I am a titanium .
dream job .
I would not like to im@@ press you .
I say it , because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
I tell you that all of you are so hard to work , whether you &apos;re now a company , a land or a class@@ room , that you may know that I am not only on the computer her@@ es@@ cal@@ ator and imagination , and it is true if I say , I understand that it is not for a dream job of dreams .
it is all a job , all work , all reality , everything blood , all swe@@ at -- no tears .
I work much , hard and I love it .
when I am deep@@ ened in the job , there is no other feeling .
my work creates a country out of nothing .
it is , when I turned up tro@@ dden down , when I painted it on a canvas .
so we dream a high sound , gir@@ der a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
it is creative , mechanical , str@@ en@@ uous and in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ating , clin@@ ically and har@@ der , clin@@ ically and sen@@ sible , fierce and sen@@ sible , and the best thing is the sum@@ s .
there is so a change in me when the work goes well .
a sum@@ s begins in my head , and it grows , and it grows , and the sum@@ s like a busy street , I could go for ever for you .
many people assume , when I declare to them the sum@@ s that I speak to them that the letter is prepared to me .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , that does it .
but the sum@@ s -- as I began working with the television production when I began to work and work together to create and collabor@@ ate , I discovered this thing , this sum@@ s , this energy .
the sum@@ s is more than that letter .
the sum@@ s is action and activity . the sum@@ s is a drug .
the sum@@ s is music . the sum@@ s is light and air .
the sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have one sum@@ s , then you can not stri@@ ve other than in size .
the feeling do not be different to stri@@ ve , regardless of the size , no matter what price .
this is how you call the sum@@ s .
or perhaps it means to be a workshop .
perhaps it is gen@@ ius .
perhaps it is E@@ go .
perhaps it is the fear of the failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I only know that I did not make the failure , and I know that I love the sum@@ s .
I just want to tell you , I am a titanium , and I know that I want to put it in question .
to make it clear : ever I &apos;m going to more episodes , the more episodes , the more over@@ loaded borders , the more things , the more do I find history , the more stories I write history , all more expectations are available .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the country I create , the marathon , whom I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s .
I like this sum@@ s . I love the sum@@ s .
I need the sum@@ s . I am the sum@@ s .
am I just this sum@@ s ?
and then the sum@@ s stopped .
revised , ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated , ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated , ag@@ ated .
the sum@@ s stopped .
now my three daughters are acc@@ ust@@ omed to the truth that their m@@ om is the only working institute .
Har@@ per tells you : &quot; my m@@ om will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
and Emer@@ son says : &quot; estim@@ ation , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da country . &quot;
there are the children of a titanium .
they are baby titanium .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sum@@ s ceased .
the sum@@ s of the engine stopped .
I loved my work anymore . the engine was off .
the sum@@ s did not come back .
my sum@@ s was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same Titan@@ en work , 15 hours @-@ day , continuous weekends , no Reu@@ e , nothing deleg@@ ate , a titanium sleeps , does not exist , with all your heart , clear eyes , whatever is always .
but there was no sum@@ s .
in me silence was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect titanium .
I was a showing @-@ Titan ,
everything was gray , I just had no fun .
and that was my life .
all that I did .
I was the sum@@ s and the sum@@ s was I .
so what do you do , if what man does , do the work which one loves , suddenly fl@@ amed ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think some are thinking : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; h@@ ay you out , the author Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know , you &apos;re doing , you &apos;re doing what you &apos;re doing to be a teacher , a teacher , Bill Gates , one loves to be a teacher , and knows how to feel the sum@@ s when you know the Sum@@ men , who is it then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a titanium ?
if the song of my heart ce@@ ases , I can survive in silence ?
and then my &quot; Southern States wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; presents a question .
I am on the way to the outside , late at it and she says : &quot; m@@ om , do you like to play ? &quot;
and I will already say no , when two things are aware of :
first , I have to say Yes to all and second , she called me not &quot; estim@@ ation . &quot;
she calls no more &quot; estim@@ ation . &quot;
when is this happening ?
I leave it when I am Titan &apos;s and my sum@@ s bet@@ s and here change everything in my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I say : &quot; yes . &quot;
it is nothing special .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we play and discover their sisters , we laugh a lot and I read the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and my pan@@ ic , in the lon@@ el@@ iness and in the absence of the Sum@@ mary , can I do nothing , except for un@@ fit .
I &apos;m focusing on .
I am quiet .
the land that I create , the marathon , whom I run , the army , the screen , the high sound - they don &apos;t exist anymore .
all that exists st@@ icky fingers and hum@@ id k@@ is@@ ses , delicate voices , juni@@ per pins and song , in which it goes down , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen leaves . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simp@@ licity .
the air in this place is so little that I can hardly bre@@ athe easier .
I can hardly believe that I at@@ me .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me is dis@@ solves .
a mental door goes on and an energy boost comes in .
and that is not immediately , but it happens .
I feel it .
the sum@@ s comes slowly .
no full volume , hardly available , it is quiet , hardly audi@@ ble but it is there .
not the sum@@ s , but a sum@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and now I feel like a magical mystery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but let us remain in the case .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it &apos;s something that we forgot .
the sum@@ s , the working environment , the titanium h@@ um , that is just the replacement .
if I ask you , who you are if I am telling you , who , if I &apos;m working with the help of ship@@ ments and TV hours and how working my brain , then I forgot what the real sum@@ s is .
the sum@@ s is no strength and it is not work specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real sum@@ s is dependent on the love .
the sum@@ s is the river , which comes from the living pleasure .
the real sum@@ s is self @-@ conscious and peace .
the real sum@@ s igno@@ res the print of history , to do di@@ versi@@ fying tasks , expect@@ ation and pressure .
the real sum@@ s is simple and original .
the real sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps there was God the wrong words to God , for which God said to me that I am a titanium ?
it is just love .
we all need a little more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say Yes .
I do this rule , so that I can free myself as a workplace of any gu@@ ilt .
it is a law , I have no other choice . I don &apos;t have any other choice if I want to hear the sum@@ s again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
it is not playing for me as we work .
the truth does hurt ,
but I don &apos;t like it to play .
I always work , because I love it .
I am rather at the workplace than home .
this conf@@ ession is painful , for what a man does not work than to be a house ?
well , yes , I .
hon@@ est@@ ly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I am in , is none of them .
we swe@@ at around the garden , and back , and go back .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we sm@@ ashed bubble bub@@ bles .
I feel mainly sti@@ ff , ab@@ sent and conf@@ used .
I always mature after my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how to live , and the sum@@ s of the universe fulfil@@ s me .
I play and play until I ask : why have we ever heard with the games ?
you can also say it ! let them always say Yes , if your child wants to play with you .
perhaps hold me for n@@ ai@@ v , for a day dre@@ aming .
you &apos;re well right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones don &apos;t want to play a maximum of 15 minutes with me until they wake up something else .
there are wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes , it replaces me a Marien@@ kä@@ fer or K@@ eks .
and I speak to my te@@ ie with me for about 15 minutes , I am the mother of the year .
there are only 15 minutes , no more needs .
everybody can bring 15 minutes on the piece , even on a bad @-@ mood !
15 minutes on pieces !
no mobile , no laundry , no laundry .
the day is short : dinner that is ready for children .
but 15 minutes are penet@@ rated !
my children are my prosper@@ ity , my world . there must not be the children . it is considered to feel the sum@@ s to feel a place for his soul &apos;s peace .
it &apos;s not playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
around the &quot; Play &quot; in general .
take the 15 minutes !
find out what you doing well .
find out it and store it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I guess and I will win . friends meet , books read , enjoy the day --
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; it &apos;s just for everything I got up when I got my first TV show when I got a Titan in education when I wanted to sur@@ pass more and more .
15 minutes a piece , why not full 15 minutes ray ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sum@@ s came back in my free time . the sum@@ s seems to return when I &apos;m not working .
does not work without any games .
it takes time , but after a few months , a door opened to the energy and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown mel@@ ody , she met me and my soul . she direc@@ ts me into new ideas . I use it again to new ideas . I use it in full bre@@ wing and love my work .
I like the sum@@ s , but I love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I &apos;m not the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , isn &apos;t I ... no more .
bub@@ bles and st@@ icky fingers , dinner with friends .
now that is my sum@@ s .
the sum@@ s of life .
the sum@@ s of love .
the sum@@ s of the work is part of me , but only a part . and therefore I was than@@ k@@ ful .
it is gra@@ b to me that I am a titanium . I never have seen a titanium which plays to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and to more games .
and yet I still have everything in the handle . my brain is still working . my bon@@ fires are still burning .
the more I play , the more happy I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as good mother .
the more I play , the more clear@@ er is my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ s . the country , which I create , the troops , whom I run , the troops , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s of life .
the more I feel this sum@@ s , the more makes this unusual , imagin@@ ative , naked and new life feeling in me wide . less titanium -- more I !
the more I feel like this sum@@ s , the more I know who I am .
I am author . I think about things I get up to life .
that belongs to the job , which means to live his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; to less work and to more games .
Titan@@ en have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very nice .
I am Neuro@@ sur@@ geon .
as most of my colleagues I have to do with human tragedy every day .
I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a heavy stroke or after a car accident .
for us Neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ es , it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organ@@ ics , has a very low ability to become self @-@ healing .
after a severe injury of the central nerv@@ ous system , patients often have a permanent , heavy disability .
this is the reason why I was functional neuro@@ sur@@ geon .
what is a functional neuro@@ sur@@ geon ?
a doctor who attempts to improve the nerve function by different surgical measures .
in certain , they have one of the most known ones , the &quot; deep @-@ brain stim@@ ulation . &quot; it im@@ planted a electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons so that the neuro@@ logical function increases .
it is really an amazing technology . it has improved the dest@@ iny of patients with Park@@ inson , who suffered heavy trem@@ bling and serious pain .
however , neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ surgery is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we find ourselves to this dream .
I want to show you that we are very close to it .
with some help the brain can help yourself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was gui@@ ding harmon@@ ic and worked and worked in the emergency .
I often have patients with Sk@@ ul@@ ls @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ Trau@@ ma .
they have to imagine that at the brain @-@ brain trau@@ mat@@ a you need to have the brain and the cran@@ ial pressure is rising .
to save the life , you must decrease the cran@@ ial pressure .
for this purpose , you have to remove a part of a s@@ wollen mil@@ n@@ ant .
instead of the s@@ wollen Shepherd mass , we decided to analyse us with Jean François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a biolog@@ ist , to analyze the brain mass .
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to grow cells from this fabric .
this is not a simple task .
let cells grow from a tissue piece , it is comparable with completely small children that are taken out of your families .
one must find the right diet , temperature , moisture and environments to th@@ ri@@ ve them .
exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts there was Jean François .
he saw under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells that are surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you know from the Bi@@ ological lessons that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can transform itself into any cell type of the organ@@ ism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small niche of the brain .
it is surprising to get this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made a further fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are imm@@ ort@@ al .
but these cells vary differently .
they divided slowly and after a couple of weeks , they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population which looked like the stem cells , but was different .
we needed long to understand from whence they came .
they origin@@ ate from these cells .
these blue and red cells called the Dou@@ b@@ lec@@ tic ker@@ f @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our cer@@ eb@@ ral cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us , they ensure the folding of the brain .
but why do they gain us ?
we do not know that .
we believe that they are participating in the healing of the brain , since we find them in higher concentrations near brain injury .
but this is not so certain .
one thing is however clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells .
we stand in front of a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop a experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain compound from the non @-@ speaking area and then the cells exactly so refined as it did Jean @-@ François .
and afterwards it is called colour@@ ing to track them in the brain .
in the last step we im@@ planted them in the decision of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ tation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we im@@ plant these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we im@@ plant the same cells in the dig@@ iti@@ ed brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we were able to work with apes .
in the first scenario we im@@ planted the cells in a healthy brain , and we observed that they were taken after some weeks , as if they were taken again , they go back home . the room is already busy , they will not be used there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we attached an injury and im@@ planted exactly the same cells , and now they ate the cells -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you can see what we observed under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were im@@ planted .
evidence that show them are these little points . these are the cells that we were in vitro , in the culture .
here we could not stop this .
help those cells also help a monkey , to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained apes with a manual si@@ ick@@ edness task .
they had to take feeds from a tablet .
that they did very well .
when they reached a stable D@@ exter@@ ity level , we have reached the motor motor@@ ized field in the motor@@ ized Cort@@ ex .
however , the monkeys were par@@ aly@@ sed , they couldn &apos;t move their hand .
just as it would be done by people , they recovered spontan@@ e@@ ously by a certain degree , just as after a stroke .
the patients are par@@ aly@@ zed and then try to recover with plastic brain mechanisms . they recover themselves a certain degree , just like the monkey .
when we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontan@@ eous recovery , we im@@ planted its own cells .
on the left , they see the monkey , which recre@@ ated spontan@@ e@@ ously .
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
now let us see when we im@@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after m@@ im@@ plantation .
I can tell you that were also very exciting results .
since that time , we have found much more about these cells .
we can freeze it and later .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example with Park@@ inson .
but our dream is still to im@@ planted them at people .
I hope really that I can show you soon as the human brain has the means to cure itself .
thank you very much .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , this is wonderful , I &apos;m sure to now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can need . &quot;
I definitely go .
of course , the question of what is the greatest obstacles before you can start clinical trials in humans .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the greatest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results we need to complete approximately two kilograms of papers and forms to walk out this kind of studies .
BG : it is under@@ stand@@ able , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and a professional team .
BG : look at the future -- you have completed research and tried to get to the start of clinical trials . if you continue in the future , how many years it will take until someone can come into the hospital , and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
it depends on the approval of clinical study .
will it allow us to allow the authority to launch it soon ?
then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients .
it has a long time to select patients to do and evaluate treatments and to evaluate this type of treatment .
after that you need to apply to a mul@@ tic@@ entr@@ e study .
you have to really notice that it is useful before you can offer this treatment .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting T@@ ED and that you have told us .
BG : many thanks .
democracy .
we will make a big error in the West as of course .
we see democracy not as the frag@@ ile plant , which is in reality , but as inventory of our society .
we tend to consider them as an un@@ altered one .
we believe that capitalism are forced to force democracy .
that is not right .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great re@@ im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing have proven that it is quite possible to have a flour@@ ishing capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains un@@ democr@@ atically democratic .
in fact the democracy dis@@ appears with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year , when I re@@ presented Greece -- the new elected Greek government -- was un@@ ab@@ able to me as the finance minister in the Euro@@ group -- our elections -- did not affect the savings programs that were implemented in Greece .
in this moment I thought that there could be no better just@@ ification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , or the Communist Party of China , or some of my local friends who repeatedly said that the democracy would change if it would change anything .
at this point , I would like to introduce an economic model for real democracy .
I pray you , together with me , again to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of error , we could save democracy but that we need a true and defensive democracy .
because without democracy , our companies are mil@@ ked , our future , and our great , new technologies are w@@ asted .
on the subject of waste , I would like to point you to an interesting contra@@ diction , the currently our taver@@ ns are threatened .
I call it the &quot; twin summit Par@@ ad@@ ox . &quot;
one summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the Scho@@ en@@ berg , who cast its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the Scho@@ den@@ berg ,
but few recognize his Di@@ dy@@ mus .
a mountain of un@@ used cash , which is to be anxi@@ ous to invest , however , to invest , where it would be productive and income , with which one could produce and do all the things that humanity are ur@@ gently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the last 3 months in the USA , in England and in the Eurozone , 3.4 billion US dollars were invested in all the wealth of goods , such as industrial facilities , machines , office buildings , schools , streets , tracks , gear and so on .
$ 3.4 trillion dollars in much money until you were compar@@ es with the 5.1 trillion U.S. dollars that were in the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing did , except the stock markets and the real estate prices .
thus , debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin summit which are not equal to the usual market mechanisms of mechanisms .
the result are stag@@ n@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ old in the USA , Japan and Europe , and therefore a low overall economic demand that could not invest these themselves in which they do not invest . exactly as Ö@@ di@@ pus Father who could not plan to kill yourself , that his son would kill him when he becomes adult ,
un@@ rolled the circumstances that lead it to kill him .
that is my Ha@@ des with capitalism --
its extremely thor@@ ough art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to further refine our lives and to finance human talents and are particularly to finance the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial for the salvation of the earth .
so is democracy the solution ?
I think so . but before we continue , what do we understand ?
Arist@@ ot@@ el@@ es defined democracy as the social form in which the Free and the poor serves as a majority to control the government .
course of course the ath@@ en@@ ical democracy was of course too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be a mistake to reduce the cell value of ath@@ en@@ ic democracy in due to these in@@ clusions .
the decision on the ath@@ en@@ ic democracy was and it is that she gave the labour to the poor , and not only the right to free expression of expression , but important and decisive , that they had the right to give them the right to political co @-@ determination with equal vote in questions of the heads .
the ath@@ en@@ ical democracy not kept so long --
like a candle that sh@@ ines very bright , it is also quickly spread .
however , our current liberal democracy have not ratified their roots in the ancient Athens ,
but in the Magna Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on the free citizens of concentrated and the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Cart@@ a , which ultimately became a statute for ruling .
for the liberal democracy was only going on , as a complete separation of politics and economy is possible and the democratic process was established , while the economy -- so the world of the corpor@@ ations -- a demo@@ c@@ rati@@ e@@ free zone .
in our current demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time , where these separation of politics and economy began , a her@@ ed@@ itary struggle between the two , the economy gradually emigrated to politics , and under@@ tak@@ eth them .
do you wonder why the politicians are not like it earlier ?
it is not in a de@@ generation of its DNA .
it is about that one can still be in the government today and nevertheless not in power because power from politics into the economy is ander@@ ed and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my Ha@@ des with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is like a flock of smo@@ kers , that su@@ stain@@ ably lasting the animals , of which it is nour@@ ished , dec@@ im@@ ated by the end .
similarly , it is similar to the economy that the policy is so far more can@@ al@@ izes that it grows through the self @-@ caused economic crisis itself . the power of the Group is growing , the ine@@ quality increases , the overall economic demand is rising and the managing director of the Group are subject to invest the cash of their enterprise .
according to the greater of capitalism , &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; &#91; the people &#93; out of democracy , the higher the twin summit , and the even greater the waste of human employ@@ ers and wealth of humanity .
if this is true , it is obvious that we need to bring politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; reserves the control , as in the ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
this is not a new idea by the way .
the mar@@ x@@ ist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it didn &apos;t honor especially especially .
the doctrine of Deb@@ ak@@ el of the Soviet Union should be that the labour arms could only recover a position as in the ancient Athens without creating new species of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is a solution : creating the poor poor !
capitalism is doing it by reducing the low @-@ wages paid by automation and robot .
the problem is that long economy and politics are separate areas , the automation can be higher the twin summit , the waste money , and the social conflicts deeper as it -- already very soon as I believe -- in countries such as China will come .
so , we need to re@@ shap@@ ing the economy and politics again , and thereby ensure that we democr@@ atically ise the resist@@ ed area , otherwise we don@@ ate the film &quot; matrix &quot; as a documentation .
so the question is not if the capitalism is brought up technical achievements , which he has brought .
the most interesting question is whether to be replaced by a D@@ yst@@ op@@ ie , similar to the &quot; Star Trek , &quot; or through something that put the society into &quot; Star Trek &quot; , or , in the machines of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ en@@ ia Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long talks the sense of life .
I think we may be optim@@ istic .
so what &apos;s it like , how could it look like this &quot; Star Trek &quot; @-@ like ut@@ opia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; - similar D@@ yst@@ op@@ ie ?
in practical implementation , I would like to give you a few examples in all the future .
in the business sector , please make a capital market in which you deser@@ ves money while you are working and in whom your capital is coming from a workplace to the next , and the company -- no matter in which one currently works -- is property of them that are currently working in the company .
then all income from capital and revenues origin@@ ating from revenues and the concept of wage labour is completely overhau@@ led .
no distinction between those who belong to the companies who are not working there , and employees who work there , but the company does not hear . no diving more between capital and work , no large g@@ aps between investment and sp@@ ars , and ultimately did not take the superior twin summit .
in the field of global political economy , please make sure that our national currencies had a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which will be issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of 20 largest emerging markets &#93; , in interest of all human beings .
imagine that the total world trade will be tra@@ ded in this currency -- call them &quot; the cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; cos@@ mos &quot; &apos; -- and each government pay the sum representing the trade deficit or trading income of the country in a common fund .
imagine that this fund is investing in &quot; green &quot; technologies , particularly in parts of the world , in which investment funds are ra@@ r .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed to the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference in 1944 .
the problem was that it was not the technical means to implement it at that time .
today , we have them , especially in the background of a recovered policy and economy .
the world I informed you , is at the same time more liberal in which she prefer@@ ed privileged individuals and Marx@@ ist because she is buried the separation of capital and work in the tr@@ ash@@ ings of history , and key@@ nes@@ ian , global key@@ nes@@ ian .
but above all , it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
we will watch over such a world in such a world
or will we sink into a matrix &quot; - similar D@@ yst@@ op@@ ie ?
the answer depends on how we decide together polit@@ ically .
it is in our hands , and we do it better than it .
thanks . thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Y@@ an@@ is ...
you qu@@ ake yourself in your biography as liberal Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos; analysis today ?
Y@@ an@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I have just said , Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... do we do that do not produce the technological development as a massive decline in overall economic demand , as Larry sum@@ mers as &quot; long @-@ term stag@@ nation . &quot;
through the transfer of this crisis of a part of the earth to the next as we currently live , it will not only dest@@ abil@@ ize our democracy but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant ,
just as Hay@@ ek , that &apos;s why I am a liberal Marx@@ ist , and as Key@@ nes , and therefore I &apos;m also completely effective .
BG : actually , and now we are too .
Y@@ V : if one is not effective , you think not enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a species philosoph@@ ical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein , which said it . BG : in your presentation , you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the Red@@ ner you did very clear what you keep from the perspective of the West to China .
do you want to repeat this here ?
Y@@ V : there is a big degree of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democracy we have the appearance of a democracy .
as I said in my talk , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of the economy is , -- a totally demo@@ cra@@ y@@ less zone is .
in a certain regard , if I may say that such a pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar to the England of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- We tend to combine liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is an error , historically significant .
Liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , as John Stuart Mill --
he was especially sk@@ ep@@ tical about the democratic development .
what can now be seen in China , resem@@ bles the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , particularly the transition from the first to the second .
China is now to refuse to do what the West has done in the 19th century , sm@@ ells great after hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I &apos;m sure that many list@@ eners were curious about your experiences as the finance minister of Greece in the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I thought that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back to the first six months later ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal visibility , and very dis@@ appo@@ inting , because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
namely , to say goo@@ db@@ ye to the benefit of the self @-@ term , and continuing that a massive expansion line was passed through the Eurozone , and continues to massi@@ vely the development of the entire European Union .
we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek subur@@ ban -- by the way , the first suggest@@ ion was to reveal this den@@ ial --
it &apos;s right to do it . unfortunately , the powers in the Eurozone , in the European group continued to deny that .
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if one tries to maintain a economic system , which is not over@@ life through political will , and authorities , it will perhaps be able to put out a while , but if the change occurs , he passes away ab@@ rupt@@ ly and destroyed .
BG : which change do you look ahead ?
Y@@ V : there &apos;s no doubt that the eu@@ ro@@ zone does not have a future if we do not change their structure .
BG : do you have any bug in your time as a finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Ern@@ s@@ th@@ aft ...
if there is a minister of finance , or any Minister , who , after 6 months in office , especially in an so @-@ stressed situation , claimed , he did not have any mist@@ akes , then this is a dangerous person .
of course I made mist@@ akes .
the greatest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the program end of February .
I believed that there was a hon@@ est interest on the pages of the money , to find a common solution .
but this was not .
they wanted to bring only our government , only because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the national@@ ization that ran through the Eurozone .
they didn &apos;t want to enter that she had been a cat@@ astroph@@ ic programme for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
it is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the Tro@@ ika of the money , who brought us up this policy , st@@ oned : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive touch of the talks , you will seem to be equal to pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolute .
my critic@@ isms of the European Union and the euro zone compared to anyone who lives and loves Europe .
my greatest fear is that the eu@@ ro@@ zone did not survive .
because if it does not survive the released Fli@@ eh@@ forces will be D@@ ä@@ mon@@ isch and destroy the European Union .
this will not have been cat@@ astroph@@ ic for Europe alone , but for the entire world economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
when we introduce ourselves to a post @-@ modern 1930 , after which it appears to be , there will be also be able to be the future of Europeans like the non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope that you &apos;re wrong in this point .
Y@@ an@@ is , thank you that you were at T@@ ED .
Y@@ V : thanks .
by Roy Price , most of them have never heard , although it is likely to be responsible for 22 @-@ moderate minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably for 22 very entert@@ aining minutes , but not for many of you .
this goes back to the decision that Roy with three years ago .
Roy Price is executive employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company of Amazon .
he is 47 years old , stream@@ lined , has an I@@ gel@@ fr@@ is@@ ur and describes it on Twitter as &quot; movies , TV , technology , Tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for the shows and content to create the Amazon .
of course , this is a very hard fought industry .
there are so many TV series that Roy cannot choose any one .
he has to find shows that are very good .
in other words , he must find shows that are on the right on this curve .
this curve is the evaluation report of over 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the evaluation goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows will receive this assessment .
if your show is valued at nine and above , this winner is a winner .
then we have a successful show .
that is shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bath , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that make ad@@ dic@@ tive , where , after you sh@@ th@@ ed a season to ask your brain : &quot; where is there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left side , here at the end , shows shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you what at that end of the curve .
Roy Price is not to come on the left side of the turn , because I think you already need special Intelligence to support &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes no idea about the medium performance , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they are simply in@@ spire .
so he must ensure that he is really on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it is the first time that Amazon is doing something , therefore Roy Price does not risk .
he wants to create successes .
he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition .
he takes a lot of ideas for TV shows and cho@@ oses through an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of any of these shows and is online to view it for free .
and when Amazon gives out free things , do you feel right ?
millions of spectators look at this episodes .
however , they don &apos;t know that they will be observed at the check of these shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team to record all .
they capture when you start the show when you p@@ aus@@ ed what parts are over@@ thrown or again .
you collect millions of data to choose which the show should produce .
indeed , they collect the data , process these and resulting in the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ Com for four republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House &quot; but it seems that many people can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t so good .
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the sense of the word -- since the average of this turn 7.4 is and Alpha House cl@@ ed at 7.5 -- so something about the average , but not just what Roy and his team worked .
at about the same time at another firm , another manager has placed a top @-@ show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming of Net@@ fli@@ x . exactly like Roy is always in search of finding this a super show , but it is also uses data but it does something different .
rather than st@@ aging a contest , he and his team found the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews that give her to the shows of which shows them etc .
then use these data to find out these small details about the spectators : which shows them what producers , which actors .
when they had gathered all the parts , they went into a car and decided to do not take a Sit@@ Com over four trans@@ formers , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards &quot; . Net@@ fli@@ x made a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; House of Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; receives a 9.1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , is the question : what happened here ?
it has two very competent , data versi@@ fied companies .
it combines these many data and it works super for one of them , but not for the other company .
why is this ?
because logic somehow states that that should work with everything .
if you collect millions of data for a decision that you should meet , then you should make a good decision .
one has 200 years of statistics like Back @-@ Up .
you are optimized through very powerful computer .
the least what you can expect is good TV , or ?
if data analysis is not working as it doesn &apos;t work , because we live in a time that we want more and more to statistics in order to meet serious decisions , far beyond TV .
do you know here the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
no . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that nobody ever comes in contact with this software . come in contact , you are in jail .
if any one is in the USA in prison and ask for release , it probably is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dis@@ mis@@ sal is made or not .
just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but rather than decide whether a show is good or bad , it is decided whether a person is good or bad .
medium TV , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that these data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are generated . this is not aware that a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
the data of di@@ versi@@ fied companies are also wrong .
yes , even Google makes mist@@ akes .
in 2009 , Google announced that it was predic@@ ts due to data analysis out@@ breaks , the worst kind , predic@@ ting -- through data analysis of the Google search .
it worked wonder@@ fully and was a great news . the success was cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the journal Nature . &quot;
it worked fine , year round , until it suddenly did not work anymore ,
and no one could say why .
it simply didn &apos;t work , this was a sensation , including the withdrawal of the publication in the journal Nature . &quot;
even the data will be versi@@ fied companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes .
despite all these bugs , the decisions of life in the decisions of life is an -- at the workplace , in the legal status of medicine .
so we should rather ensure that data can be helpful .
also I know many difficulties with data . I work in the computer@@ ized genet@@ ics -- a area where some very clever people can use un@@ imagin@@ able many data to make serious decisions like the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a medication . over the years I recognized some patterns on the difference between successful decisions using data and not successful decisions . this design should be widespread .
do you need to solve a complex problem each , do mainly two things :
as the whole , place this problem in its individual parts , so that you can analyze the components of single parts ; as a second place , set the components again to deal with a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : apart and put together again .
and now the most important facts : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how ma@@ iling , can help press a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to assemble the parts and then come to a decision .
there is another tool and we have it all : our brain .
if there is something that is good in which the brain is good , it is parts and pieces , even if the information is un@@ complete , so if the information is un@@ complete , especially if it is the brain &apos;s brain .
that is why I was , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they have used data and understanding , where they also belong to the process .
you use data to understand their audience , for what else you would not have been able to put it . however , the decision to put all these parts , and make it a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; that doesn &apos;t stand in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they entered a big personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , however , did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first as she finished about TV ideas , then called &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
it was a secure decision because they always could say : &quot; they say the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions , but I believe that things go wrong if data start to control our decisions .
no matter how ma@@ stered they are , data are just one tool , and in order to forget that this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before the data delivered , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; magic 8 Ball &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; it is amazing . for decisions using a j@@ a- or no matter , you just need to shake the ball to get a reply . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most likely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- exactly here at this moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I become a technique later with a technique .
so far I met some decisions in my life , with what I would have to listen to the ball .
but , as you naturally know if you have the data available , you would like to replace this by something much more exhau@@ sting , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic body .
thus perhaps the ball cl@@ erg@@ ent and clever and clever . finally , it is about to make decisions when we want to reach an extraordinary at the end of the right curve .
and I think this as a very encour@@ aging news that it is still paying out to make decisions in spite of the great amount of data , an expert in what you do , and risks .
because at the end there are no data , but the risks , with which you land up at the right end of the curve .
thank you very nice .
