<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as New York Times reporters.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before someone heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published more spectacular, that the NSA was illegal telephones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence service operation in which the CIA was literally culminated for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If the crazy sounds, you can read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know whom the chapter did not right?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years the government has established the government against Risen, and called upon him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this train, he became the symbol of the government to condemn Whistleblower and to bespate journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media do not receive this information and can't protect the identity of the Much.</seg>
<seg id="14">So, when the government of Risen was done, he did something that many brave reporters did before him, and he refused, and said that he would prefer to go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen lived so with the risk to go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the process, something unusual.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although they were present for years that it had been indispensable for their case, the demands of the government were dropped to Risen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: during the period of electronic monitoring the reporters and sources can always hide less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rather than to be ashamed and risen on statements, this might also do his digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so, the investigator, without his consent, his telephone numbers would be worried about,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just as its e-mail data, financial and banking information, its lending information, and even travel links with the list of its flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA-Whistleblower source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama talked to protect Whistleblower, but instead, the justice condemns him more than all US governments before him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how to be a problem, especially because the government is too much of their work as secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national safety was the result that a Whistleblower came to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So, we are looking forward to the press team that should be protected by the first constitutional requirement, because the government has more possibilities to send out all.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as the technology of the government allowed to handle the rights of repaid, the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better.</seg>
<seg id="29">And indeed they can contact them from the moment in which they contact, instead of the afternoon, in the testimony.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there are communications software that had not been written as Risen had written a book, and it is much more secure than normal e-mails or telephone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">One such technology is SecureDrop, an open-source transmittment system for Whistleblower, which was originally developed by Aaron Swartz, which has been developed by us from the Freedom of the Press Foundation, which I have been working.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of send an e-mail, go to a news website, such as the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can also upload documents or information, as with any ordinary contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These will then be encrypted and stored on a server, which only has the respective News Agency.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government can't work out more information, and many of the information that would request, would not be available from the event.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole, to protect the press status in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments of the world are always developing new spy technologies that all endangered us.</seg>
<seg id="38">It's sure to ensure that not only technology companies such as Edward Snowden give an opportunity to overcome miseries. it is just as important that we protect the next Whistleblower,</seg>
<seg id="39">The discounted of abuse during the supply of soldiers knows and overcrowded in the hospitals. or the next environmental workers, the alarm to the sewage water of Flint. or a Wallst-Insider that warns us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies have not only been made for those who want to uncover crimes, but to protect our constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks. thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[3 April 2016] the largest data of the history was published.] [the "Panama Papers" reveal that the rich and Mightsman of Global Witness, [what does this mean?] this week we were submitted by news about a Leck of 11 million documents of the law firm Mossack Fonseca</seg>
<seg id="43">Publication of these documents provides a small insight into the secret world of the tax havases.</seg>
<seg id="44">We will get an impression of what customers, banks and lawyers will go to companies such as MoscowFonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you agree?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the e-mails, exchange messages, as the whole system works, as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already taken very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland became prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that one ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad Corresponds affiliated companies in tax havases.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russia's President Vladimir Putin leads to a close friend from pediatriations, a famous Cellists.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people and others who wait more nervous to the next publication, and the next reveal documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the plot's plot, or a John-Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems cries away from you, me, unusual men.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do that?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and mighty are in the situation, their assets are to hide and not all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as healthcare, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">In all over the world, media and leading politicians, such as secret control phases of some few will be used to hide and closed their fortune -- something that we have been discussing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people will find this whole world very confusing, and it's hard to understand how these tax havases will work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always set it to me like a Matrijoschencape.</seg>
<seg id="60">So, one company in another company, in another company which makes it almost impossible to understand, who is behind these bones.</seg>
<seg id="61">It may be very difficult for criminal prosecution and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what thing is.</seg>
<seg id="62">I think it is interesting that there are less reports about this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because there have been no prominent Americans that came in these abbreviations, this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Well, it is not so that there is no rich Americans that hide their assets in tax havases.</seg>
<seg id="65">However, by the principle that these control phases work, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">Would we have a data of the Cayman Islands, or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see a lot more cases and examples that have connections in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is so that in some US states you need to specify less information, to establish a company than to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparency in the U.S. has allowed to settle for school children to school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has been allowed to zoom particularly vulnerable brackets.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior, which affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here, at Global Witness, we wanted to find out how all this in practice would like.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a concealed investigator into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator gave himself as African ministers, to bring the suspects money into the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">It really shocked us that all, except for a lawyer to our investigator, how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all precursor. none of these lawyers participated as clients, and of course no man was handed over to the money. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as a single occasion.</seg>
<seg id="78">It does not work for a single advocate, who gave to our covered investigator suggestions.</seg>
<seg id="79">It does not move around a single top politiy, wrapped in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It goes, as the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability can be established.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to handle it, we must change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">We must change the rules to make this type of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">It may sound everything very fast, as if we could do nothing against it, as if nothing could have changed ever; as if there is always the rich and mighty.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a safe optimist I see that some things have begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the last few years we have seen suggestions to more transparency, which concerns the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The subject took political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron to the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU is represented in central registers at national level, who is really behind companies in Europe, and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the USA falls below.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have brought a bill in both parliamentary chambers but this does not make the progress that we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of the tax havases, used as a means to ensure more transparency in the US and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness, this is a moment for changes.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their real identity behind projector companies.</seg>
<seg id="93">We need managers in the economy to rise and say, "Intransparent is not good for business."</seg>
<seg id="94">We need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it through laws this type of intransparent.</seg>
<seg id="95">Together, we can finally terminate the intransparent, which now makes this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story, as I was almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk by a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I finished my design studies, I made a deposit sale.</seg>
<seg id="98">A type in the red Mazda remained and looked at my mind.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was in the city alone and took a roadjourney through the whole country. after that he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me excited about how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I got tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">When we paid the bill, I made the error to ask: "where do you sleep this day?"</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he even got worse:" "" "I don't know." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought: "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got him yet to know! he says he would go to peace corps, but I don't know if he really planning it. I don't have been abducted in the boot of a Mazdas land!</seg>
<seg id="110">That is a small luggage compartment!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard me say, "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said," "" "h how please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">In the night I was in bed, I starred on the ceiling and thought: "Oh man! what have I been involved in me?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild booms in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such fear that I got up out of the bed, on a tenth at a door and completed my bedroom door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork, which he had bought from me is today in his classroom. he is a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">That was my first experience as hosts. it has completely changed my viewing angle.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold in childhood were sold as strangers, actually friends who only were waiting for them to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">People caught on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's make a jump, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I'm working unemployed, almost pleite, my roommates and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I believe that creativity can make it, anxiety in fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote my best friend and new roommates Brian Chesky: "Brian, I have overlay how we could earn something. our apartment will stay on a designer-bed-and-breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a writing desk, including a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a web site and founded "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three fortunate guests were allowed to sleep for $20 on the air mattress on wood floor.</seg>
<seg id="131">They loved it, and we also loved.</seg>
<seg id="132">I am sure our cheese ham cream cheese is completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them through the whole city. as we passed our last guest, and the door fell into the castle, rigid Brian and I joined us.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends and could pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came to rolls.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former fellow-people, nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out whether they could make a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented the investors: "we want to create a website, on which people publicly pours out their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms, whose doors are coming when you come over.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet you can download the foreign people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">That's the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the missile would igniter.</seg>
<seg id="142">But did it not.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still full of comfort, would invest in a store that allowed strangers to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we have learnt all learnt that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, one can be used on things that can be good. we were able to design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Fine Arts, we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create great confidence by design, between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design afford something?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create with design confidence?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample, what grade we commit.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it is out of your comfort.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up if you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to try to unlock your cell phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your unlocked mobile phone to your left seat post.</seg>
<seg id="157">This silent flight of panic, which you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts will, if she open the door the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">For the only thing that is still personal as your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the locked mobile phone of a stranger in the hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So the most guests will feel when they can stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Only one time, who actually has Al Gores Mobile Phone?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you declare to Twitter, that it is responsible for the Office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can return the phone off right now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I want to tell you some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What would, if we have changed a little detail on this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor had first appeared only once with his name, if he tells whence he comes from whence he comes, how his dog or his children be called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine, you had 150 Beads, who say: "he can really hold unlocked cellphones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you would have to leave your cell phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-covered feedback system strengthens trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we have done some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for people to disable negative assessments.</seg>
<seg id="175">Ultimately, we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had submitted their essments before we introduced them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We performed with Stanford a study. we examined how likely it is that people should trust in one another, depending on how they are similar to age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprisingly, we trust the people most, which are the most similar.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less confidence we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It is exciting if you add to the call of a person - in our case by assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">If one has less than three distribution departments, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation of all similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">So the right design can help us to overcome some of our deep roots.</seg>
<seg id="186">We also heard that confidence depends on it, how much man is there.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">If one tells you too little, how to "Hi!," you get no answer.</seg>
<seg id="189">One tells you much, as for example: "I have problems with my mother" -- -- the request is also not accepted.</seg>
<seg id="190">"" "so there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g." "" "Great works of art in your dwelling! I do with my family holiday." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="191">How to create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips to which topics should be explained.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on hope that the right design may help to overcome our inheritance from strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">As we had not counted, the great amount of people who were more than willing to take these deposits.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a demand that had not been bred before.</seg>
<seg id="200">The business is very good for us.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not smooth running.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who are not allowed to have been devastated parties or dwellings.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked on customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front front when it was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it's already hurt when I just remember it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that hear in the voice of the callers, and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve us.</seg>
<seg id="208">Luckily, a fraction of 123 million, only a fraction has a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people confided to each other.</seg>
<seg id="210">If it works, we can do wondrous works.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay and suffered a heart attack there.</seg>
<seg id="212">His hosts drove him into the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even got blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travellers who tend to ventricular activities due to sitting activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real protection gel that save a life even though they don't know correctly.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive a car in the hospital when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want to feel lonely, they bring books.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer, without charge the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">Of course not every stay expires.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind pure cash flows are exactly what you want to reach with the Share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I came on this concept for the first time, I asked:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of money with cash transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is about a economic trade here.</seg>
<seg id="227">But just 's' s' right now, the matter will not be justified.</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People imagine a part of oneself open, and that changes.</seg>
<seg id="230">If you travel today, it is efficient and reliable, but it is efficient and reliable, but it is less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What if travelling is a rich buffet from local oppress?</seg>
<seg id="232">What would be, if at any place you visit, a group there would wait to fill a group there and show a pentagpentour neighborhood of which one has never heard;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you have to learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What would if we would like to tell the apartments of the reason?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What would, if cities would take advantage of the common share?</seg>
<seg id="238">I present cities in front of which we offer society and relationships, instead of loneliness and firing.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea's capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking places, which belonged to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">The residents were offered now. students who were searching for a stay,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were conveyed by people whose children had gone out. incubator programs have been started,</seg>
<seg id="242">In order to finance new start-ups in Share economy. over our platform alone, 785 000 people will be guest in 191 countries for a stranger or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea seems so that it was not so crazy about how it was brought to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We didn't reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality was also available before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There have been similar websites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work now?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from luck and timing we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of confidence.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us to overcome deep root parts.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find it blossom,</seg>
<seg id="251">Stunningly long.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it, if a red Mazda goes on me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know of course that design cannot solve every problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use the design soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks. thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you watch me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Is suppressed or suppressed, a brains have undergone a terror?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay on security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is true true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">For example, the media that look like me look like.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of the coverage of Islam and Muslims are negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: Americans think most of those would not know any Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Presumably the people do not speak with their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">To all those who have never learned a Muslim: it is great to meet you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee wife -- Double Espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am stracted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A seagull-fitness fanatician,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing, spiritual Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga sings, for, baby, I was not born so.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do it.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17, I met the decision to ouched me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual man, as some of my friends, but as Muslims. I decided to wear the Hijab, my head cover.</seg>
<seg id="277">"" "my feminist friends were horrified:" "" "why are you oppressed yourself?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="278">The Lustem was: at that time it was a feminist Declaration of Independence, and opposite the pressure that I felt as 17-year-old felt to adapt to a perfect and unachievable beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have wrestled with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought then, turned into question, doubted and believed.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was confidence and slow devotion which deepened with each reading of the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythms bring me to wine.</seg>
<seg id="285">I know myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Did you ever feel the feeling that somebody takes you, you are completely understandable, and yet somehow he loves?</seg>
<seg id="287">It feels like that.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I married and began, as all the good Egyptians, my career as engineers.</seg>
<seg id="289">I had later, after my marriage, a child, and was basically the "Egyptian-American dream."</seg>
<seg id="290">Then the awful morning came in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast at the end, looked on the screen and saw the word "Express". "</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, aircrafts flew in buildings, people spans from the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was this?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned fast in indignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should I do something?</seg>
<seg id="299">"" "I switched to the television channel and heard:" ""... "Muslim terrorists..." ""... "... in the name of Islam..." ""... "..." ""... "..." ""... "..." ""... "" ""</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh, my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It is not just my land attacked, but in the Nu enged me the actions of others by a citizen in a suspects.</seg>
<seg id="302">On that same day, we had to go through the Middle west of the USA to move into a new city and begin with the postgraduate studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember how I drove -- as we keep silent -- so deep it went into my seat, and I feared the first time when Muslims were recognized.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved to our apartment in this night, in a new town where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">"" "and then I heard that I read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations which said:" "" "be careful," "" "Seid carefully" "", "" "" "do not lead in well lit" "", "they are not" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then, there was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather themselves together.</seg>
<seg id="308">"" "and again the warnings:" "" "does not work on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were mistakted, and I heard of attacks on Muslims or of people who stayed for Muslims, went into free and struck.</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really brandances at mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something felt really felt right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because people who attacked this country, have attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I wished the rage of people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was angry also.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to explain himself.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">There are the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Today, we can say that people can say: "there is a problem in this land -- it means Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we go on? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to close Muslims and mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church as one tumor in the body of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="324">It's only the question: are we pondering or rescued?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumor can be removed as a whole and a rescuous tumor just under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are, like all other Americans, no tumor in the body of the USA, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, heifer and Olympioners.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closing of mosques America be safe?</seg>
<seg id="331">There will be a few parking, but not stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">Regular visit of a mosque helps people to consider other faith tolerant, and to show greater participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in the Washington area, D.C. recently told, people are actually not alizes in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are razed in their cellar or bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">It has been noted that it begins online. when the person is cut off from their church, the veterans can do so that the person believes that the person believes that the terrorists are abhing the true Muslims, and everyone who abhors their behavior and ideology is aboutdated or by faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent Radialization, we must stop the people to go to the Mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still say that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group of how is IS outbreeding with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a man, think I think we must do everything to stop a group as the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would like to put us to their preference, when they recognise it as a representative of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS had so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux-Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups assert their ideology reasons behind their "Holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">But if you cast a look at it, they do not drives what they are in her "Holy Scripture."</seg>
<seg id="345">It is its brutality that they can read these things into the scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding imam telling me a amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him, because they were silent to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was surprised and asked him if they had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was just the opposite. everyone who spoke to her, brought her to silence, and told her that her anger, her sense of unrighteousness in the world, it would only be in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Nothing inspired and something that would have been given to their groove, it was a main goal for the instrumentalisation of extremists who spoke to a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam turned the connection to God and their church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Rather than to accuse them for her rage, he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she met in the mosque, she tried to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">That was an insight, as the Islamophobia suffered me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect the normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it work on any other?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24 hour consumption of fear every day affects our democracy?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies - show: if we fear us, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We rather accept an authoritarian system system, conformity and other parts.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows: if one reports test persons, in which negative about Muslims were reported, they voted in more military attacks on Muslim lands as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just a academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look when the tuning against Muslims were shot upwards - between 2001 and 2013 -- this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in advance of the Iraq War and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So the Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror, as I expected it.</seg>
<seg id="365">It is actually a tool to manipulate the public in order to undermining the foundation of a free society, sensible and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We might feel it as the first, but the toxic air of the fear of us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the assignment of collective debt, it is not just about to explain himself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married pair that lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both were to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was an athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was in the dental faculty, talented, promising her...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would say to me that he was the most generous man, who knew her.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her life-run. she was hoping and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when is such a young man from my breasts?"</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after visiting Suzanne in her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, murdered them, just as the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was in the afternoon. he did in her flat as with a execution, after he was postponed against Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He shot eight times to Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanatism can not only be immoral, but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Are we gone to the mosque or we stayed at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We besought it and for us it was no easy decision, because we want to let us leave our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can freely exercise our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the nursery seat we were silent, with high pressure at the Mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, went out my footwear, went into the prayers, and what I saw, left me.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was restless filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the beam made a announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because the half of the gathered Christians were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who had come, not to attack us but for us.</seg>
<seg id="387">In that moment, I joined together.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there, because they had the courage and compassion.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose from the moment of anxiety and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you go on number safe?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join those who think: we are better than those.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you very nice!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have a nervous.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I ask myself, what do you say that you're saying that you're a TEDTalk, a think of low-speed work, i.e. an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say about those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say that you don't know. I'm completely normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am as usual as it is permitted.</seg>
<seg id="402">When you look at the Muslims in all over the world, and I did this with the greatest of the study conducted among Muslims in all over the world, people want to normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want to be prosperity for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I am no exception in any respect.</seg>
<seg id="405">If people like an exception to the rule, then the rule has been broken, and they are not the exception to rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What began as platform for Basters, just before it came to become a billion-dollar store.</seg>
<seg id="408">Monitoring, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial threats. this is made possible in research facilities worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before the air-site transfer to our social consciousness, a autonomous fleet of flight machines at the Frac Centre in France has built a six metre high tower in front of the audience. some years ago, they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting the machines speeds up high speed and acceleration in the smallest space.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build selflable structures as well.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to carry loads to move with turbulences and respond to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you a few of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our aim is to exceed the limits of possible in an autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order to work an autonomous system, it needs to know that mobile objects can be found in the space.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. that allows us to focus on developing dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new location technology from Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space, calculations on board which should do the machine.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external orders are available at the highest point e. g." "" "and" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flight device, which tries to beat two flying with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other Starrvolgler, it is efficient, much more efficient than helicopters in all their variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most of the starters, it can be boar, and so great benefits at start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">But there is always a flipside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of rear lights is that they react sensitive to turbulence such as wind oils.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flight device is no matter what the optimum position is recovered and the performance can be improved through practice.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research we often set fundamental abstract questions related to the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be for example: what is the smaller number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for this to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopter are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that can be joined to violate you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago trained pilots of remote-driven flying devices, which had just two moving parts: a propeller and a rear skirt.</seg>
<seg id="435">Never long, we discovered that flying with only one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the Monospinner, the mechanical simplest control unit. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only one movable part, one propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No valves, hinges and cross-ruders, no further Stellated or control surfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, the inside live very much, so it can be stable, and can move in the room.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear. to bring it to flies, I must throw it exactly right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The likelihood to throw it exactly right when all look on, is low, therefore I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">When the Monospinner is a practice in practice, this machine is here, the Omnikopter with its eight propane, one exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this excess?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is just symmetrically.</seg>
<seg id="445">Therefore it is ambivalent in his alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">In this way he gets the best ordinary ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">In the space to move in all directions, no matter in which direction it is turned or even as he rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">A lot is obvious in models, the rest is learns directly to fly.</seg>
<seg id="450">We look forward to that.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines should be part of our everyday life, it must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine comprises two separate two-propeller aircraft machines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">If you assemble them together, they are like a high-performance Quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">However, something wrong - a motor or propeller is falling from, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly if also restricted.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate that, by half of course we are airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration was examined by synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took a commercial micro-Quadcopter -- every single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and stoutfit them with localising technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where space is and selects. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully you can motivate these demonstrations to develop new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine because the Broadway would like to be a flying lampholder to Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us is the reward in the development and the work act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder, how wonderful and magical our universe is, and that it makes it creative, to form it in such a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive professional and economic potential, is the dot on the i.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">At 1.3 billion years ago, two black holes in a very far distant galaxy is always faster, they turned into the mass of three merges in a ten-second in pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment they lightened brighter than all stars in all galaxies of the entire universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big pop.</seg>
<seg id="472">They didn't put their energy in form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was given into space-time-pounding itself and exploded the universe exploded in gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">We arrange events at first time.</seg>
<seg id="476">1.3 billion years ago, a majority life was created on earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then, the Earth has brought a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people, and -- God understand us even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago she decided to build a group of particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss, MIT, KIP Thorne and Ronald Drever of Caltech -- to search for gravitational waves, which arise approximately through colonating black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most they kept for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized as crazy Genies so that the US National Science Foundation has financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, conception and extremely much hard work, they built the detector LIGO: the laser Interferometry Gravitational Observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the following time, the precision of LIGO was increased significantly, which significantly improved the detection rate.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015 LIGO was launched for a last test run in order to clarify some small hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="485">On 14 September 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detector, the gravitational waves of the two colliating black holes removed through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were emotional as this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the goodbye of my death-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically, the fruits of my life was basically.</seg>
<seg id="492">All this, what I had worked, is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been researching gravitational signals for 23 years and their by observatory such as LIGO measuring signals. but what are vitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational shaft is a change in the geotherspace of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When passing the shaft, the room and its entire contents are stretched into a direction and clearing the other into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">To illustrate the dozers of courses in curses for the theory of relativity often perform a really albered dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dust, stretching and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14, for example, every one was stretched out at the waves of the waves, and the elongation of an average people was 10 to -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That is called 20 zeros according to the Comma, followed by a 1. therefore the LIGO employees declared for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five kilometer long laser detector, and this is absurd, this length would have to be measured less than a thousandths of a nuclear core. this is grotesk.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">Described KIP Thorne, a co-founder LIGOs, hunting according to the waves in the way: "the technical difficulties of the construction of such detectors are extensive.</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicist are dark and with the support to the public, all obstacles will be overcome. "</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to LIGO. Scott claims that LIGO is more an ear than one eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">The light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than the things about us around: factorches, the size of your mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="508">That's quite practical. for so you can manufacture a picture or a map of things by taking off the about several points of coming light around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">The other is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 metres.</seg>
<seg id="511">Therefore it is very hard, actually impossible to produce a picture of things, which mean you especially much:</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child is approximately.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead, we listen to certain characteristics such as clay and level, rhythm and volume to close to the history behind.</seg>
<seg id="514">"now Alice is talking about Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"Dune Bob".</seg>
<seg id="517">The same is true for gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can do with them any simple images of objects in all.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by having regard to changes in amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least the measured frequencies are at least for LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="521">So if we convert wave pattern in sound, we can listen to the all literally.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravitation to listen, we can betray us about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott are already busy very long.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, shine simply: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turn the two body very fast, you hear the same circulation with an additional sound change. that sounds like this: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a type of course set, shaped into the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date which at least I never forget -- heard LIGO the following: [Surrender sound] Jose who must hear what he must hear, detects this as sound by -- SH:... two black holes with each 30-fold sunbathe mass, which rotate around as quickly as the bars of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: if we are briefly, what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in all, one with a mass of 29 tons, the other one with a mass of 36 tons, revolve each hundred times per second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know of it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">There are permanent importance of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">LIGO ebnet a fully new way to explore the universe, as it was never possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the All and the Invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">And much in all, we can't see -- practically or basically -- no matter.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why mtrench stars in supernovae explode.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. of them we have learned a lot about the All.</seg>
<seg id="538">But the exciting physical processes are done in the core, which is hidden behind thousands of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see, since these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves are penetrating iron, as it would be transparent glass. it would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it because the urge is veiled by his own offspring.</seg>
<seg id="541">With the help of gravitational waves, it should be possible until the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And probably the most important thing: I am optimistic that we have never seen in all things we have never seen, which we have never seen, and of whom we don't have any idea that we can discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact LIGO appeared in the first attempt of things that we had not expected.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says on this topic: ME: the kind of stars that produce black holes, such as LIGO they are observed, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient body from prehistoric times. the black holes are so to speak the Saurierknochen for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">LIGO gives us a completely different viewing angle of the events in All, on the emergence of the stars and ultimately, as we went out of this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is now to be as good as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to LIGO, we know how to build great detectors and quench the cosmos of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new Observatories -- a completely new generation of Observatories on Earth and All.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than to listen to the urine?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now the time is big dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dreams about us with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thanks. thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried to experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "one year I would say to all" "" "Yes!" "" "before I was afraid." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter whether it got me nervous to me in unpleasant situations, I forced me to say "Yes".</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Do I want to be live on television?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Wanted to start playing with the scene?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a mad thing happened exactly what to do, wovor I feared, failed my fears.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fears, speeches, my social fear -- Puff, gone.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes," he has changed my life.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain Yes, that changed my life to one unexpectedly. it started with a question of my petitions.</seg>
<seg id="569">I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the youngest, is called out of unexplained reasons. "</seg>
<seg id="570">In case she would be a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"estimation, I need milk for my beak-asse."</seg>
<seg id="572">She once asked, if I could play with her when I was just on the go. and I said, "yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new attitude of living in my family. from there I will swear again to play with them, as soon as you want to do with them. no matter what I am doing, or where I go, I say always Yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I'm getting tired of me.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, on my children, on our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an amazing side effects: just before short, I was entirely aware that the "Yes" -Sages to play with my children my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am author. I think about things, establish you to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No. no.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create television. I book television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I'm doing television, in big style.</seg>
<seg id="586">I am responsible for this TV-season to carry out 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are available at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each broadcast provides hundreds of jobs that are not existing before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode of nine days, four shows, every nine days 20 million dollars, four TV programs, 70 hours of TV, three programmes available at the same time: 24 episodes: Scandal, 15 episodes: Scandal, 15 episodes: Scandal, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours of television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America, my TV series will run on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">My series will run in 256 languages for 30 million viewers across the world.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are shipments that I have created themselves, and not only produced, so I have to find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans around the campfires and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four television series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires that burn around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who makes it?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, this is why I am a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I would not like to impress you.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it, because I know what you think when the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you that all of you are so hard to work, whether you're now a company, a land or a classroom, that you may know that I am not only on the computer herescalator and imagination, and it is true if I say, I understand that it is not for a dream job of dreams.</seg>
<seg id="603">It is all a job, all work, all reality, everything blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work much, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I am deepened in the job, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work creates a country out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is, when I turned up trodden down, when I painted it on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">So we dream a high sound, girder a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanical, strenuous and intoxicating, clinically and harder, clinically and sensible, fierce and sensible, and the best thing is the sums.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is so a change in me when the work goes well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A sums begins in my head, and it grows, and it grows, and the sums like a busy street, I could go for ever for you.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people assume, when I declare to them the sums that I speak to them that the letter is prepared to me.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, that does it.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the sums -- as I began working with the television production when I began to work and work together to create and collaborate, I discovered this thing, this sums, this energy.</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than that letter.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sums is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have one sums, then you can not strive other than in size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling do not be different to strive, regardless of the size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is how you call the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it means to be a workshop.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is Ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of the failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I only know that I did not make the failure, and I know that I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you, I am a titanium, and I know that I want to put it in question.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make it clear: ever I'm going to more episodes, the more episodes, the more overloaded borders, the more things, the more do I find history, the more stories I write history, all more expectations are available.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The country I create, the marathon, whom I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound, the sums, the sums, the sums.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this sums?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, exaggerated, exaggerated, agated.</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mom is the only working institute.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells you: "my mom will not be there, but you can write my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">And Emerson says: "estimation, I want to go to Shonda country."</seg>
<seg id="646">There are the children of a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby titanium.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the sums ceased.</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I loved my work anymore. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as always: the same Titanen work, 15 hours-day, continuous weekends, no Reue, nothing delegate, a titanium sleeps, does not exist, with all your heart, clear eyes, whatever is always.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me silence was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect titanium.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a showing-Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was gray, I just had no fun.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">All that I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sums and the sums was I.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do, if what man does, do the work which one loves, suddenly flamed?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I don't think some are thinking:" "" "hay you out, the author Titan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know, you're doing, you're doing what you're doing to be a teacher, a teacher, Bill Gates, one loves to be a teacher, and knows how to feel the sums when you know the Summen, who is it then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a titanium?</seg>
<seg id="670">If the song of my heart ceases, I can survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "Southern States waitress" presents a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">I am on the way to the outside, late at it and she says: "mom, do you like to play?"</seg>
<seg id="673">And I will already say no, when two things are aware of:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I have to say Yes to all and second, she called me not "estimation."</seg>
<seg id="675">She calls no more "estimation."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">I leave it when I am Titan's and my sums bets and here change everything in my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says," "" "Mom, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say: "yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">It is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">"" "we play and discover their sisters, we laugh a lot and I read the book" "" "Everybody Poops" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in the loneliness and in the absence of the Summary, can I do nothing, except for unfit.</seg>
<seg id="684">I'm focusing on.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The land that I create, the marathon, whom I run, the army, the screen, the high sound - they don't exist anymore.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists sticky fingers and humid kisses, delicate voices, juniper pins and song, in which it goes down, or whatever the girl in "The Ice Queen leaves."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so little that I can hardly breathe easier.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I atme.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me is dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes on and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that is not immediately, but it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums comes slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly available, it is quiet, hardly audible but it is there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sums, but a sums.</seg>
<seg id="700">"" "and now I feel like a magical mystery." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="701">But let us remain in the case.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It's something that we forgot.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the working environment, the titanium hum, that is just the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you, who you are if I am telling you, who, if I'm working with the help of shipments and TV hours and how working my brain, then I forgot what the real sums is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums is no strength and it is not work specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sums is dependent on the love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sums is the river, which comes from the living pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums is self-conscious and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real sums ignores the print of history, to do diversifying tasks, expectation and pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real sums is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps there was God the wrong words to God, for which God said to me that I am a titanium?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a little more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say Yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this rule, so that I can free myself as a workplace of any guilt.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is a law, I have no other choice. I don't have any other choice if I want to hear the sums again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">It is not playing for me as we work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth does hurt,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like it to play.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work, because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I am rather at the workplace than home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This confession is painful, for what a man does not work than to be a house?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, yes, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">Honestly, I call myself "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am in, is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We sweat around the garden, and back, and go back.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We smashed bubble bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel mainly stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always mature after my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the sums of the universe fulfils me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask: why have we ever heard with the games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! let them always say Yes, if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Perhaps hold me for naiv, for a day dreaming.</seg>
<seg id="742">You're well right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones don't want to play a maximum of 15 minutes with me until they wake up something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">There are wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes, it replaces me a Marienkäfer or Keks.</seg>
<seg id="750">And I speak to my teie with me for about 15 minutes, I am the mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">There are only 15 minutes, no more needs.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everybody can bring 15 minutes on the piece, even on a bad-mood!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes on pieces!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile, no laundry, no laundry.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner that is ready for children.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are penetrated!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my prosperity, my world. there must not be the children. it is considered to feel the sums to feel a place for his soul's peace.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not playing with your own children. it's about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">Around the "Play" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Take the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out it and store it.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect in it. I guess and I will win. friends meet, books read, enjoy the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" it's just for everything I got up when I got my first TV show when I got a Titan in education when I wanted to surpass more and more.</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes a piece, why not full 15 minutes ray?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums came back in my free time. the sums seems to return when I'm not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Does not work without any games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months, a door opened to the energy and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, she met me and my soul. she directs me into new ideas. I use it again to new ideas. I use it in full brewing and love my work.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the sums, but I love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I'm not the sums, the sums, isn't I... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">Now that is my sums.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sums of the work is part of me, but only a part. and therefore I was thankful.</seg>
<seg id="778">It is grab to me that I am a titanium. I never have seen a titanium which plays to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and to more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I still have everything in the handle. my brain is still working. my bonfires are still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the more happy I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel as good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the more clearer is my head.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the sums. the country, which I create, the troops, whom I run, the troops, the sums, the sums, the sums, the sums, the sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this sums, the more makes this unusual, imaginative, naked and new life feeling in me wide. less titanium -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel like this sums, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am author. I think about things I get up to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">That belongs to the job, which means to live his dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">This is the dream of this job,</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dream job should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said "Yes" to less work and to more games.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titanen have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you very nice.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am Neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">As most of my colleagues I have to do with human tragedy every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after a heavy stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us Neurosurgees, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organics, has a very low ability to become self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a severe injury of the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, heavy disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is the reason why I was functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who attempts to improve the nerve function by different surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">In certain, they have one of the most known ones, the "deep-brain stimulation." it implanted a electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neurons so that the neurological function increases.</seg>
<seg id="805">It is really an amazing technology. it has improved the destiny of patients with Parkinson, who suffered heavy trembling and serious pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">However, neuromodulation does not mean Neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgery is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we find ourselves to this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I want to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help yourself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was guiding harmonic and worked and worked in the emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often have patients with Skulls-Hirn-Trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that at the brain-brain traumata you need to have the brain and the cranial pressure is rising.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save the life, you must decrease the cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">For this purpose, you have to remove a part of a swollen milnant.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of the swollen Shepherd mass, we decided to analyse us with Jean François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, to analyze the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this fabric.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not a simple task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Let cells grow from a tissue piece, it is comparable with completely small children that are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">One must find the right diet, temperature, moisture and environments to thrive them.</seg>
<seg id="823">Exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts there was Jean François.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells that are surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you know from the Biological lessons that stem cells are unripe cells that can transform itself into any cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niche of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to get this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made a further fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells vary differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They divided slowly and after a couple of weeks, they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population which looked like the stem cells, but was different.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand from whence they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They originate from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells called the Doublectic kerf-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our cerebral cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the fetus, they ensure the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they gain us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they are participating in the healing of the brain, since we find them in higher concentrations near brain injury.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so certain.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is however clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand in front of a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop a experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brain compound from the non-speaking area and then the cells exactly so refined as it did Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="853">And afterwards it is called colouring to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we implanted them in the decision of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplantation -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we implant these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we implant the same cells in the digitied brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with apes.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we implanted the cells in a healthy brain, and we observed that they were taken after some weeks, as if they were taken again, they go back home. the room is already busy, they will not be used there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we attached an injury and implanted exactly the same cells, and now they ate the cells -- they grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you can see what we observed under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were implanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">Evidence that show them are these little points. these are the cells that we were in vitro, in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Here we could not stop this.</seg>
<seg id="864">Help those cells also help a monkey, to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained apes with a manual siickedness task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take feeds from a tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">That they did very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable Dexterity level, we have reached the motor motorized field in the motorized Cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">However, the monkeys were paralysed, they couldn't move their hand.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would be done by people, they recovered spontaneously by a certain degree, just as after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralyzed and then try to recover with plastic brain mechanisms. they recover themselves a certain degree, just like the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted its own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left, they see the monkey, which recreated spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can bring about 40% to 50% of its original performance from injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now let us see when we implanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after mimplantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting results.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time, we have found much more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it and later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example with Parkinson.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implanted them at people.</seg>
<seg id="882">I hope really that I can show you soon as the human brain has the means to cure itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is wonderful, I'm sure to now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know someone who can need."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely go.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question of what is the greatest obstacles before you can start clinical trials in humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the greatest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results we need to complete approximately two kilograms of papers and forms to walk out this kind of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: it is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and a professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look at the future -- you have completed research and tried to get to the start of clinical trials. if you continue in the future, how many years it will take until someone can come into the hospital, and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">It depends on the approval of clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us to allow the authority to launch it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It has a long time to select patients to do and evaluate treatments and to evaluate this type of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">After that you need to apply to a multicentre study.</seg>
<seg id="897">You have to really notice that it is useful before you can offer this treatment.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We will make a big error in the West as of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We see democracy not as the fragile plant, which is in reality, but as inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as an unaltered one.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism are forced to force democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not right.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great reimitators in Beijing have proven that it is quite possible to have a flourishing capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains undemocratically democratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact the democracy disappears with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the new elected Greek government -- was unabable to me as the finance minister in the Eurogroup -- our elections -- did not affect the savings programs that were implemented in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">In this moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew, or the Communist Party of China, or some of my local friends who repeatedly said that the democracy would change if it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point, I would like to introduce an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I pray you, together with me, again to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of error, we could save democracy but that we need a true and defensive democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">Because without democracy, our companies are milked, our future, and our great, new technologies are wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the subject of waste, I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction, the currently our taverns are threatened.</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twin summit Paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">One summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the Schoenberg, who cast its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the Schodenberg,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his Didymus.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which is to be anxious to invest, however, to invest, where it would be productive and income, with which one could produce and do all the things that humanity are urgently needed, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the last 3 months in the USA, in England and in the Eurozone, 3.4 billion US dollars were invested in all the wealth of goods, such as industrial facilities, machines, office buildings, schools, streets, tracks, gear and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">$3.4 trillion dollars in much money until you were compares with the 5.1 trillion U.S. dollars that were in the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing did, except the stock markets and the real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus, debts and unproductive capital form the twin summit which are not equal to the usual market mechanisms of mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result are stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-old in the USA, Japan and Europe, and therefore a low overall economic demand that could not invest these themselves in which they do not invest. exactly as Ödipus Father who could not plan to kill yourself, that his son would kill him when he becomes adult,</seg>
<seg id="925">Unrolled the circumstances that lead it to kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">That is my Hades with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">Its extremely thorough art. all the unproductive capital should be used to further refine our lives and to finance human talents and are particularly to finance the technologies, "green" technologies that are crucial for the salvation of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">So is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I think so. but before we continue, what do we understand?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as the social form in which the Free and the poor serves as a majority to control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">Course of course the athenical democracy was of course too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be a mistake to reduce the cell value of athenic democracy in due to these inclusions.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decision on the athenic democracy was and it is that she gave the labour to the poor, and not only the right to free expression of expression, but important and decisive, that they had the right to give them the right to political co-determination with equal vote in questions of the heads.</seg>
<seg id="935">The athenical democracy not kept so long --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that shines very bright, it is also quickly spread.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our current liberal democracy have not ratified their roots in the ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the athenian democracy focused on the free citizens of concentrated and the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately became a statute for ruling.</seg>
<seg id="940">For the liberal democracy was only going on, as a complete separation of politics and economy is possible and the democratic process was established, while the economy -- so the world of the corporations -- a democratiefree zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our current democracies, since the time, where these separation of politics and economy began, a hereditary struggle between the two, the economy gradually emigrated to politics, and undertaketh them.</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why the politicians are not like it earlier?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not in a degeneration of its DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is about that one can still be in the government today and nevertheless not in power because power from politics into the economy is andered and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my Hades with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is like a flock of smokers, that sustainably lasting the animals, of which it is nourished, decimated by the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, it is similar to the economy that the policy is so far more canalizes that it grows through the self-caused economic crisis itself. the power of the Group is growing, the inequality increases, the overall economic demand is rising and the managing director of the Group are subject to invest the cash of their enterprise.</seg>
<seg id="948">According to the greater of capitalism, "Demos" [the people] out of democracy, the higher the twin summit, and the even greater the waste of human employers and wealth of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="949">If this is true, it is obvious that we need to bring politics and the economy, and it would be better if the "demos" reserves the control, as in the ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea by the way.</seg>
<seg id="951">The marxist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it didn't honor especially especially.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine of Debakel of the Soviet Union should be that the labour arms could only recover a position as in the ancient Athens without creating new species of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: creating the poor poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism is doing it by reducing the low-wages paid by automation and robot.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is that long economy and politics are separate areas, the automation can be higher the twin summit, the waste money, and the social conflicts deeper as it -- already very soon as I believe -- in countries such as China will come.</seg>
<seg id="956">So, we need to reshaping the economy and politics again, and thereby ensure that we democratically ise the resisted area, otherwise we donate the film "matrix" as a documentation.</seg>
<seg id="957">So the question is not if the capitalism is brought up technical achievements, which he has brought.</seg>
<seg id="958">The most interesting question is whether to be replaced by a Dystopie, similar to the "Star Trek," or through something that put the society into "Star Trek", or, in the machines of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenia Agora, "in long talks the sense of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we may be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what's it like, how could it look like this "Star Trek "-like utopia instead of the" matrix "- similar Dystopie?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to give you a few examples in all the future.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the business sector, please make a capital market in which you deserves money while you are working and in whom your capital is coming from a workplace to the next, and the company -- no matter in which one currently works -- is property of them that are currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income from capital and revenues originating from revenues and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who belong to the companies who are not working there, and employees who work there, but the company does not hear. no diving more between capital and work, no large gaps between investment and spars, and ultimately did not take the superior twin summit.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economy, please make sure that our national currencies had a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which will be issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of 20 largest emerging markets], in interest of all human beings.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the total world trade will be traded in this currency -- call them "the cosmos," in units of "cosmos" '-- and each government pay the sum representing the trade deficit or trading income of the country in a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund is investing in "green" technologies, particularly in parts of the world, in which investment funds are rar.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had proposed to the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that it was not the technical means to implement it at that time.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today, we have them, especially in the background of a recovered policy and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I informed you, is at the same time more liberal in which she prefered privileged individuals and Marxist because she is buried the separation of capital and work in the trashings of history, and keynesian, global keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all, it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will watch over such a world in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a matrix "- similar Dystopie?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we do it better than it.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks. thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You quake yourself in your biography as liberal Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx 'analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I have just said, Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... do we do that do not produce the technological development as a massive decline in overall economic demand, as Larry summers as "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">Through the transfer of this crisis of a part of the earth to the next as we currently live, it will not only destabilize our democracy but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Just as Hayek, that's why I am a liberal Marxist, and as Keynes, and therefore I'm also completely effective.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are too.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if one is not effective, you think not enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a species philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein, which said it. BG: in your presentation, you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the Redner you did very clear what you keep from the perspective of the West to China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Do you want to repeat this here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a big degree of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracy we have the appearance of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my talk, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of the economy is, -- a totally democrayless zone is.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a certain regard, if I may say that such a provocative, China is similar to the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remember -- We tend to combine liberalism with democracy -- this is an error, historically significant.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, as John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was especially skeptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What can now be seen in China, resembles the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, particularly the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China is now to refuse to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smells great after hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I'm sure that many listeners were curious about your experiences as the finance minister of Greece in the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I thought that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back to the first six months later?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from personal visibility, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">Namely, to say goodbye to the benefit of the self-term, and continuing that a massive expansion line was passed through the Eurozone, and continues to massively the development of the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek suburban -- by the way, the first suggestion was to reveal this denial --</seg>
<seg id="1008">It's right to do it. unfortunately, the powers in the Eurozone, in the European group continued to deny that.</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If one tries to maintain a economic system, which is not overlife through political will, and authorities, it will perhaps be able to put out a while, but if the change occurs, he passes away abruptly and destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: which change do you look ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there's no doubt that the eurozone does not have a future if we do not change their structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: do you have any bug in your time as a finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- Ernsthaft...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a minister of finance, or any Minister, who, after 6 months in office, especially in an so-stressed situation, claimed, he did not have any mistakes, then this is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The greatest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the program end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was a honest interest on the pages of the money, to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But this was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They wanted to bring only our government, only because they didn't want to deal with the nationalization that ran through the Eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't want to enter that she had been a catastrophic programme for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">It is worse than during the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">"" "none of the Troika of the money, who brought us up this policy, stoned:" "" "this was a colossal mistake." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive touch of the talks, you will seem to be equal to pro-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolute.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My criticisms of the European Union and the euro zone compared to anyone who lives and loves Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1030">My greatest fear is that the eurozone did not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">Because if it does not survive the released Fliehforces will be Dämonisch and destroy the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This will not have been catastrophic for Europe alone, but for the entire world economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">When we introduce ourselves to a post-modern 1930, after which it appears to be, there will be also be able to be the future of Europeans like the non-Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you're wrong in this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you that you were at TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thanks.</seg>
<seg id="1038">By Roy Price, most of them have never heard, although it is likely to be responsible for 22-moderate minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy with three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is executive employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company of Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, streamlined, has an Igelfrisur and describes it on Twitter as "movies, TV, technology, Tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for the shows and content to create the Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a very hard fought industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy cannot choose any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows that are very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows that are on the right on this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation report of over 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the evaluation goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows will receive this assessment.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is valued at nine and above, this winner is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then we have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">That is shows like "Breaking Bath," "Game of Thrones," The Wire "-- all the shows that make addictive, where, after you shthed a season to ask your brain:" where is there more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left side, here at the end, shows shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- that should tell you what at that end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price is not to come on the left side of the turn, because I think you already need special Intelligence to support "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes no idea about the medium performance, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they are simply inspire.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must ensure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it is the first time that Amazon is doing something, therefore Roy Price does not risk.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes a lot of ideas for TV shows and chooses through an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of any of these shows and is online to view it for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And when Amazon gives out free things, do you feel right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators look at this episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they don't know that they will be observed at the check of these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team to record all.</seg>
<seg id="1066">They capture when you start the show when you paused what parts are overthrown or again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">You collect millions of data to choose which the show should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">Indeed, they collect the data, process these and resulting in the answer, and this is: "Amazon should make a SitCom for four republican US senators."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House" but it seems that many people can remember this show because it wasn't so good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's just an average show -- in the sense of the word -- since the average of this turn 7.4 is and Alpha House cled at 7.5 -- so something about the average, but not just what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">At about the same time at another firm, another manager has placed a top-show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming of Netflix. exactly like Roy is always in search of finding this a super show, but it is also uses data but it does something different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Rather than staging a contest, he and his team found the existing data on the Netflix audience, so the reviews that give her to the shows of which shows them etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then use these data to find out these small details about the spectators: which shows them what producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had gathered all the parts, they went into a car and decided to do not take a SitCom over four transformers, but a drama series about a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards". Netflix made a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"" "" "" "House of Cards" "" "receives a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted." ""</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course, is the question: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">It has two very competent, data versified companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">It combines these many data and it works super for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">Why is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow states that that should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data for a decision that you should meet, then you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">One has 200 years of statistics like Back-Up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You are optimized through very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least what you can expect is good TV, or?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis is not working as it doesn't work, because we live in a time that we want more and more to statistics in order to meet serious decisions, far beyond TV.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Do you know here the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that nobody ever comes in contact with this software. come in contact, you are in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If any one is in the USA in prison and ask for release, it probably is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dismissal is made or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like at Amazon and Netflix. but rather than decide whether a show is good or bad, it is decided whether a person is good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Medium TV, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that these data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are generated. this is not aware that a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data of diversified companies are also wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that it was predicts due to data analysis outbreaks, the worst kind, predicting -- through data analysis of the Google search.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news. the success was culminated in a publication in the journal Nature. "</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked fine, year round, until it suddenly did not work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply didn't work, this was a sensation, including the withdrawal of the publication in the journal Nature. "</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data will be versified companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these bugs, the decisions of life in the decisions of life is an -- at the workplace, in the legal status of medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather ensure that data can be helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">Also I know many difficulties with data. I work in the computerized genetics -- a area where some very clever people can use unimaginable many data to make serious decisions like the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a medication. over the years I recognized some patterns on the difference between successful decisions using data and not successful decisions. this design should be widespread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">Do you need to solve a complex problem each, do mainly two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">As the whole, place this problem in its individual parts, so that you can analyze the components of single parts; as a second place, set the components again to deal with a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important facts: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how mailing, can help press a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we have it all: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something that is good in which the brain is good, it is parts and pieces, even if the information is uncomplete, so if the information is uncomplete, especially if it is the brain's brain.</seg>
<seg id="1118">That is why I was, Netflix was so successful because they have used data and understanding, where they also belong to the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">You use data to understand their audience, for what else you would not have been able to put it. however, the decision to put all these parts, and make it a show like "House of Cards" that doesn't stand in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that they entered a big personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, however, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first as she finished about TV ideas, then called "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a secure decision because they always could say: "they say the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions, but I believe that things go wrong if data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how mastered they are, data are just one tool, and in order to forget that this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before the data delivered, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"" "magic 8 Ball" "". "it is amazing. for decisions using a ja- or no matter, you just need to shake the ball to get a reply." "" "most likely" "" "-- exactly here at this moment." ""</seg>
<seg id="1131">I become a technique later with a technique.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far I met some decisions in my life, with what I would have to listen to the ball.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you naturally know if you have the data available, you would like to replace this by something much more exhausting, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic body.</seg>
<seg id="1135">Thus perhaps the ball clergent and clever and clever. finally, it is about to make decisions when we want to reach an extraordinary at the end of the right curve.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I think this as a very encouraging news that it is still paying out to make decisions in spite of the great amount of data, an expert in what you do, and risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because at the end there are no data, but the risks, with which you land up at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very nice.</seg>
