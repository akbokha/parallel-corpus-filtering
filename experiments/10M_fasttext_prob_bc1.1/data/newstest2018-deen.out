Munich , 1856 : four maps to change your view of the city
a w@@ ander attor@@ ney , where young people are to encounter .
a grave chapel , where it is dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ ers generate the in@@ hosp@@ itable reason of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories about days .
it doesn &apos;t matter if maps are not current .
this knows everyone who had to exc@@ itement because the car Nav@@ i takes place a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
the historical maps of the digital Bayern @-@ At@@ l@@ ases , an offer of the ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als Bavaria in the State Government , are all others as currently - yet very reve@@ aling .
especially if you compare it with current online cards .
this will be clear how cities and municipalities in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Merk@@ ur has changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a Fli@@ ck@@ et@@ ry carpet , which one recogni@@ zes as such .
for cities and municipalities with more detailed maps , so @-@ called prehistoric covers , were incorporated .
this originated according to the Bavarian survey@@ ing Administration between 1810 and 1864 and jump the first survey@@ ors .
your Client : Napoleon .
the French army leaders in Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon inv@@ aded an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic survey of Bavaria in order - of course for military purposes .
finally , when the French troops arrived at the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville of February 9th , 1801 there were the current neigh@@ bors who created the idea of a comprehensive Bavaria map .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV Joseph drove the project further , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and thus the Bay@@ erische Staatsoper &apos;s Bavarian Bureau . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ur@@ position blatt for Munich dates from 1856 and is to be found as all others on the Bavarian State Library on the website .
compare Spring / Today is the example of the state capital at the most op@@ pressed .
the city has grown in all directions and has grown together .
one example is under@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856 .
ship@@ owner was meant for 21 years after the creation of the map , i.e. 1877 , the Munich &apos;s district .
today is Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling in the middle of the city .
the houses were concentr@@ ating on today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ strasse , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ er in 1878 , a leader of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the western park is , you can see nothing as fields - at first glance : when it appears , a smaller card with dozens of lines and numbers : handwritten entries from the so @-@ called &quot; Ur@@ intake , &quot; which was derived from the base tax .
small plots there are no farmers there today - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the &quot; Land in the Sun . &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
the Theres@@ ien@@ wi@@ ese , since 1810 Sc@@ ene of the October , was actually a meadow and not a concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map provides an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the jung@@ le leaf one reads in the area of today &apos;s au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen district , not only the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the inn &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or from the An@@ ak &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the fan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mistaken . &quot; &quot; &quot;
yes , here on the road road un@@ locked people with w@@ ain@@ ties .
there was in 1858 / 59 the Munich circuit @-@ Ireland &quot; On the Au@@ er fan . &quot;
from 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den conducted the institution - the psychiat@@ rist who is brought to King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was most advanced for his time , and ended for instance the chains of the so @-@ called . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he has taught the staff to apply violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has worked for an exhibition with the An@@ st@@ alt .
for 280 patients was first place , later it was extended to 500 seats .
sometime , this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the Kreis@@ ri@@ ren@@ anstalt in hair 1905 .

in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; have been erected in an architectural approach to the origin of the Irish construction of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , who had been destroyed during the Second World War .
the Marien@@ platz was recorded in 1856 as &quot; main square &quot; , the shopping street called &quot; Kauf@@ inger alley . &quot;
a decisive change was the Second World War also in the heart of Munich .
the bom@@ bers of the Al@@ lies broke out in December 1944 in the city centre .
a big stayed until today - at Marien@@ hof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a salute chapel from the Middle Ages stood at the Marien@@ hof , where these days the preparatory work and on 5 April 2017 will take place the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn line .

Civil Code published Travel Guide for Missouri
the National Federation for Promot@@ ing Color has issued a warning for coloured people who are traveling to discrimin@@ ate politics and rac@@ ist attacks in the state of Missouri .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory Board of Missouri , which is to enter into force by August 28 , 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ American trav@@ ellers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ aner , as a number of frag@@ ile inci@@ dents occur in the whole state and listed here , &quot; says it in the opinion of the group .
a recently passed law of Missouri , which makes people difficult to gain discrimination , as well as the prosecution authorities of the state , the un@@ disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ate in minority groups , the group that ad@@ mit trav@@ ellers , said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; they have violations of civil rights that happen to people .
they will be put together because of their skin colour , they are killed or killed , &quot; said the President of the Missouri NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the Kansas City Star .
&quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard . &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the USA .
the group quoted inci@@ dents such as rac@@ ist ver@@ ging against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .
S@@ anders died in frag@@ ile circumstances beginning of the year after he had no more petrol during the journey through the state , accused of being accused of being accused of a crime .
the Council also shows a recent report by the Office of the General At@@ tor@@ ney General of Missouri in which it is shown that black car drivers will be 75 percent more common in the state .
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware of and their families , friends and staff what could happen in Missouri , &quot; said Chapel .
&quot; people must be willing to bring it possible to bring their money or the relatives that they travel through the state . &quot;
Missouri stayed in the year 2015 in Hass@@ elt , according to the latest figures from the FB@@ I , which is the state in relation to the number of such injuries to the 16th place of the country .
the trav@@ eller is also a reply to a new Missouri law that would make it difficult to compl@@ ain about a company for residential or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ al Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had published traveling companions for Texas and Arizona , who ple@@ dged to under@@ take local prosecution authorities to rep@@ lic@@ ate people for immig@@ ration , which will contribute to the view of AC@@ L@@ U to further re@@ pro@@ filing .
travelers are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , but in the last time stak@@ eholder groups have used the measure as a reaction to certain laws and trends within the USA .
electric fence Project is Elem@@ ent@@ ar
the Fr@@ ench@@ man Wei@@ dez@@ au@@ n project is a success project and will be continued in the next year .
the CDU federal Parliament Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac took a picture on the spot .
at the grave yard of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family , representatives of the Pan@@ erb@@ acher met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann first opened in@@ sights into its operation , in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows , and also many young k@@ itt@@ ens and houses in five apartments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black Forest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the alternative market@@ able for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is only regional trains to the table of the holiday guests .
as he is also BL@@ HV @-@ Chairman of Fisch@@ erb@@ ach , he also called the electric fence as &quot; Elem@@ ent@@ ar important . &quot;
I cannot generate steep surfaces on this type .
the green area care for much work , a lot must be treated with the brush@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have here with the terms and to fight with the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed by Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he adopted the el@@ ter@@ nal operation and accepted this without chemical plant protection and fertilizers , even if he lead no bio@@ mode .
for mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; the Commune has recognized the importance of the electric fence and is glad through the Leader &quot; Leader . &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare the farmers would have to be supported .
you hope that the view of the surfaces could be stopped for a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have , are people who work in agriculture and make thoughts on how they continue to continue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed the Mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the farmers are often involved in criticism of the promotion .
in 2013 , a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 .
the open space amounts to 40 hectares , which may not be atten@@ ed for at least 2023 .
of the total cost of 71 500 euros , half of the leader was promoted by leader , a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fisch@@ erb@@ ach .
thus , the farmers stayed 12 610 euros , which they had to invest in 16,@@ 2 kilometres .
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and rural women do not go . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Peter White &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stand firm : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here are the best food produced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Regional Court of Baden @-@ Württemberg ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Wu@@ ert@@ tem@@ berg enables the state funding of women &apos;s f@@ ences .
the goal is to open the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald .
the presence of one of the L@@ PR has been used .
furthermore , the in@@ oc@@ clu@@ ding area should not be tra@@ ce@@ able ( st@@ aff@@ ection above 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the conception .
a total of eight participants with 24 par@@ c@@ els , which would like to build a 16 @-@ kilometre fence .
the open space represents 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump is now taking the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est character of a regime change is when they start to attack statues .
the Americans estimate these likewise as every other - therefore the sor@@ row@@ ful fall of Saddam Hussein &apos;s death on the Fir@@ dos place in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , knew certainly what he did when he had a symbolic ax@@ e in a heat dispute using Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N on the proposals of the president to dra@@ stic decline of legal immig@@ ration to the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller did not handle the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of bo@@ aters and liberty im@@ it@@ ators have had gel@@ yn@@ chron@@ ous when he had done it .
but he took their significance , and in particular the importance that it was attributed to the famous po@@ em by Emma Lazarus , 17 years after the completion of the monument , his base was added .
when Miller car@@ co@@ sta wrote : &quot; I don &apos;t want to go on a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world .
the po@@ em , which you relate to which was added later , and is not part of the original statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is obj@@ ec@@ tively correct but as he formulated it himself , it is not really around history .
it is about the cont@@ empl@@ ative words of Lazarus , the only one in which a state does not only invites any old immig@@ rants , but the p@@ oo@@ rest of the poor : &quot; your we@@ bs , your poor , and your op@@ pressed masses , which is to bre@@ athe freely , and the drop of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time in which the &quot; des@@ per@@ sion &quot; was better to see on our screens .
Miller did not eng@@ age in literary criticism - he clearly did that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural conflict : it is indeed a conflict around the meaning of America .
Lazarus - and their friends who used to place their words after their death on the basis - did very good that they had completed a highly political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American rep@@ ublic@@ ans by introducing them in an un@@ used classic picture depic@@ ting the female em@@ bo@@ diment of freedom .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her po@@ em the female figure is no more abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself another name : mother of the Ex@@ il@@ ant .
the compound with the picture is a brilliant fem@@ inist Cou@@ p and a devastating attack on the American Nati@@ vity .
and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , the people wanted to change from the right wing for a long time .
the great cry of Rush Lim@@ b@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist to the coming of Tr@@ ump , argu@@ ed 2010 that the Statue of Liberty wants to introduce the American flame into the world : &quot; Lady Liberty continues .
it should wear the ch@@ ack@@ el of the freedom of the United States in the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch does not have the way to shine in the United States . &quot;
pretty unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh here on something .
the importance of the statue is quite and even a matter of the point of perception .
the big imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus was in it to see how they were troubled , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible travel on the de@@ cks of ships .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is in the true sense to see the world from perspective of people who seek refuge and improve their lives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
their statue says to them the words of hope and of the welcome which they must hear .
and this is of course not the perspective , the Miller and tr@@ ump ever want to recognize .
their tor@@ ch does not shine the way , but the hat@@ red that is the only source of power .
world Championship 2017 : Neil Black is Scottish Members of the United Kingdom
Eil@@ id@@ h Do@@ yle is remin@@ is@@ cent of a time when only two sh@@ all@@ ots belonged to the United Kingdom team .
the performance director of athlet@@ ics of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ strong cont@@ ingent of Scotland in the world championship race will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes selected for London in 2017 which starts on Friday .
black believes that &quot; Scotland has become something special &quot; in Scotland , &quot; and the athlet@@ ics of the United Kingdom must learn from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it , and we try to understand , and we will continue to figure out until we &apos;ll find it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athl@@ ets think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Athlet@@ ics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ alli@@ zed medals , among them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - which will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah at the 5.000 m distance while Eil@@ id@@ h Do@@ yle was elected by the team to team @-@ capit@@ als .
&quot; Eil@@ ab@@ h is rather modest .
their capit@@ als talk was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a series of athletes , whether they were Scottish , or wherever they live or exercise , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motiv@@ ated .
the passion and the genuine feeling that Eil@@ id@@ h was completely destroyed , were great . &quot;
the Commonwealth of Silver med@@ alli@@ sts who will compete for the fifth World Championships at the 400 m Hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team .
in Scotland , the best total number of athletes at the World Championships was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the Middle distances of Mu@@ ir runs on this road and placed in five British and two European records in the past year .
it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , which runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman to win the victory at the British team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games .
Do@@ yle is remin@@ is@@ cent of their first world championships , when the only other Scot@@ sman was in Team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
the cre@@ st capit@@ als says that she is &quot; enorm@@ ously proud &quot; to the fact that many of their coun@@ try@@ men did not only belong to the team , but in some cases also with the medals and at the Fin@@ als .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so special is what team member states that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was anyway a great honour , but to know that my team @-@ mates have voted for me and have chosen me , making it something very special for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the vill@@ i who belong to the team .
it only shows how far we came .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes , who want to climb on Po@@ ts .
what are my speech given as a surrender ?
yes , I think it went well .
I only noted that in this situation we are very happy because we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to put on this home @-@ support and to benefit that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
I get a second chance to go out and compete , and it &apos;s just a great atmosphere there outside . &quot;
block from critics on Facebook : do not work for a public office if you do not wear the heat of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad news .
the Americans George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers beat him because of the in@@ policy up to its political principles .
he imp@@ ec@@ te in the cr@@ iti@@ que , safe .
but he did not put his reviews on silence .
for the year 1783 , Washington said : &quot; the free speech can be taken away - and , stup@@ id and silent , we will be led as sheep for the battles . &quot;
this brings me to Maryland to Larry H@@ og@@ an who has to work on it , more like Washington .
H@@ og@@ ans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ al Union has accused him at the beginning of this week .
the staff of the Govern@@ ors dismissed the law@@ suit as fri@@ vol , and the online commentary was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , &quot; and ? . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; said many people .
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it is a guy like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is astonishing .
he has the second highest consent of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is no re@@ ac@@ tionary H@@ itz@@ head .
he has shown a solid hand at the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to principles .
he was also very sent to use Facebook as a primary means to connect to his elec@@ tors and to de@@ but@@ t his hair on his side after chemotherapy .
therefore , the blocking of persons that come to the site of the Govern@@ ors - which is a public forum , which is officially called and of employees who are paid by public tax @-@ Dollars - un@@ necessarily and eventually dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , H@@ og@@ an spokes@@ person Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse defended the actions of the governor and argu@@ ed that the blocking of comments may not be more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the image of un@@ controlled or split or h@@ asser@@ ted people that are online .
the Post said with some of the real people who were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
and these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders , a teacher , a business@@ man and a priest , no part .
they all said that their comments were respec@@ t@@ ful and not prof@@ ited .
the pastor cited the Bible in his post office and appe@@ aled to H@@ og@@ an Catholic faith .
legal attor@@ ney at Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not h@@ asser@@ ted , but she asked for Hass@@ elt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry that I was disappointed that there was no reaction on Hass@@ elt and other current news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote in the commentary area of the news programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not give this idea even if a number of people participate in the same subject , then they will be regarded as a so @-@ called collec@@ ti@@ ques and not as a large group of people concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what the employees of the Govern@@ ors as &quot; concentr@@ ating spam attack , &quot; another would probably call &quot; inter@@ c@@ ession &quot; .
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by using a critic or deleted a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in previous time when you have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical conduc@@ ts and burn or demonstr@@ ating or demonstr@@ ating demonstr@@ ators and to silence .
but exactly that happens digitally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public officials , which critic@@ ised that he has imp@@ lies Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is lam@@ inated by Twitter users , who were blocked from his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question was last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County conce@@ aled the First A@@ ext@@ ment , according to U.S. District Judge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is , in Alexandria when she joined a Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Govern@@ or Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit to AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be so heavy .
at time of time , the time of an affordable port had a similar effect as the internet .
the number of newspapers , between 1776 and 1800 , and anonymous letter , beat on his leadership .
and even at that time Washington had an anonymous force .
the people who used pseud@@ ony@@ ms as &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius and &quot; Por@@ ti@@ us &quot; wrote all the letters to newspapers , which made Washington &apos;s decisions .
Pet@@ itions , which critic@@ ises his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , the trade and shipping with the United Kingdom , prevail against the historical documents , which were collected by the George Washington project by the Online Pap@@ ers of the George Washington Project .
but he didn &apos;t have them to silence .
freedom of freedom , differences and courses are the foundation of our nation .
the real guide means that we accept .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty - hop@@ ing for domestic comfort at the Renaissance Club
the former Europeans N 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope in the next three days in local comfort , since the Renaissance club is held at East Loth@@ ian the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who led to the Arch@@ er@@ field Links to the end of the year , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , joined the new venue as the tournament founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi .
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he reaches its fame in this event , &quot; said Raphael .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the players will see this course from his best side , it is in a great condition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jerry has made a great job when he established this place .
he is an e@@ ager@@ ly disc@@ ard of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great display for this course . &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defend a championship for the first time , although he won in his 32 @-@ year career both at the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour .
&quot; that feels really particularly , &quot; said the player said in South@@ port .
&quot; I did not defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open in the year when I had won them from the program .
back to that part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of the last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon , last year to win .
it was a really special time and one that we always estimate . &quot;
Gary OR@@ R , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50th birthday in this year , returns to the home market .
this event will be the first Scottish show since Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s always a bit more when you play at home &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said OR@@ R , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you feel also this extra pressure .
I really enjoyed it again , and I played a solid golf course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad , as far as it came . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the trio on the field are the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the Senior Major Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ one .
OR@@ R and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belong to the six sho@@ ots on the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond .

less lung cancer by passive smoke
over the past two decades , less people have died of lung cancer in the past two decades .
the scientists from the Hamburg University of Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come to this result .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 167 lung cancer cases are attributed to passive smoke , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison he moved to this topic of 1994 .
at that time there were still 400 lung cancer cases because of passive smoking a year in Germany .
the new investigation is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
house connections refer to be very complex
the construction work in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; are reas@@ on@@ ably higher in the time , &quot; says the director of the architect Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of house connections , the situation is complex than suspected , as in the underground much , what does not understand in the plans .
the traffic , which works always the construction work , represents a big problem for the part of the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; the Ig@@ nor@@ ance of motor@@ ists before red lights and shut@@ ters is already enormous , &quot; reports Hein@@ ze .
the road is locked and only the bus buses are eligible for passing .
Angelo Car@@ uso , Marvin Kost@@ or@@ z and Tim Kost@@ or@@ z from the company St@@ ump@@ p has been working with the bridge for weeks since weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were quite beautiful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but fortunately we were looked after by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; tells Marvin Kost@@ or@@ z .

of course late can be too late . most village men are unemployed , and many drink heavy , and there are the soldiers .

it is a rare insight into the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 after a controversi@@ al referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,0@@ 26 El@@ ders should vote against the occupying troops .
an existing movement that had reached independence against the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jakarta which maintains the control over the region and exclu@@ de foreign journalists or legal gu@@ ards .
in 2003 the province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , with the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea as the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as far as it is desert . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the province Capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then another morning 5 @-@ hour drive with car rental .
there are no public transport .
the city with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses , surrounded by bam@@ bo@@ o f@@ ences , and from corrugated walls that have been converted from rust in various yellow tones .
only very few Indones@@ ians have taken their journey here , refused to journalists and practically no fore@@ igner .

there were other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and indicates its vi@@ bran@@ t , hand @-@ woven tur@@ ban , her dar@@ ker shirt and her bright rock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had only our leaves to our body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pap@@ ua is the worst province , where 28 % of people live under poverty line and some of the worst child mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a plateau of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 , Fre@@ ep@@ ort has reduced the value of 3.1 billion US dollars in gold and copper .
furthermore , Pap@@ ua has over wooden resources valued at $ 78 billion .
however , these riches are a source of the mis@@ ery for the Pap@@ ua that will ensure that Indonesia &apos;s largest military ensures a top @-@ reaching presence .
a study from 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort &apos;s local military , and units sold nearly $ 20 million between 1998 and 2004 , among them up to 150,000 US dollars to a single officer .
as a result of larger autonomy , these golden alle@@ ans thre@@ aten and are cont@@ emp@@ t@@ less treated .
according to activists , more than 500,000 Pap@@ ua has been killed and thousands were ra@@ ped by the Indonesian military , tor@@ tured and imprisoned since 1969 .
mass murder in Pap@@ u@@ as St@@ ut@@ land in the 1970 @-@ 70 years were sentenced to genocide in accordance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission .
in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peace@@ fully demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a report of the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese Brisbane from 2016 , in which reports about atro@@ cities committed in the previous year are , such as un@@ legal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electro@@ stim@@ ulation are particularly popular according to another report - and the brutal precip@@ itation of peaceful demonstrations .
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims , as every week inci@@ dents , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researchers for Human Rights Watch .
the bolts have strengthened , as Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring a influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demo@@ graphic development has changed , since Muslim business migrants are changed of the most populated islands Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra , and Sul@@ aw@@ esi .
Jav@@ an@@ ian War@@ ung @-@ Kant@@ ines sell fried chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ uts .
local people fight it here .
&quot; migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables on the traditional market as the local Pap@@ ua was cheaper , &quot; A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ Local , who moved to the province capital of J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; it costs the native Pap@@ ua - the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - their market . &quot;
the Indonesian President J@@ oko Wi@@ do@@ do , known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , spoke the ine@@ qualities and the legal viol@@ ations in Pap@@ ua during his election campaign in 2014 .
the former Zimmermann secured 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the Presi@@ dential Palace in Jakarta .
but in Pap@@ ua has changed little , and today the nati@@ ves feel betrayed .
&quot; our hearts are broken because we have voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , with the expect@@ ation that he will meet our hopes that the righteousness will be restored , &quot; says You .
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a low point for two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is .
on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas Car@@ ols in front of a bon@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke out on a motorcycle by the darkness .
the fri@@ gh@@ tened children said to them that they should switch their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers took a violation of her tone and came back with four soldiers , so the pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk drunk , pursued the group with their po@@ ison , said victims and witnesses .
then a soldier led into the group of children .
one child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ o , was defeated so seriously that he fell into coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby governmental commission was set on fire and the things es@@ cal@@ ved on the next day .
about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered themselves together in a football field before the local police station and the Military Commander for Justice to request justice .
they had to cr@@ ushed Jag@@ db@@ ye and carried out the Wa@@ ita Dance - circle running and a bird @-@ singing - by Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ Stamm .
some demonstr@@ ators began to catch the stones of police and military po@@ urs .
when the atmosphere was heated , the soldiers have sent a command of an internal radio : &quot; if the masses do more than three times , they shoot it dead , is called it in an official document of TI@@ ME , which was not approved the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the leader of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ four of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the dro@@ pping risk and called for peace and ur@@ ged the amount to return home .
no one was listening to the mood .
&quot; when I turned back , I was suddenly shot in my left hand , &quot; said he said TI@@ ME on the veranda of his colorful wooden house .
Kay@@ ame still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but he says that the sphere came out of the rows that were gathered here .
&quot; it was crow@@ ded , many shots were fired . &quot;
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , the witness of the shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and sought his body to make sure that he was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es , who , as many Indones@@ ians only carries a name , the TI@@ ME in dark mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him . &quot;
the Che@@ ese Spec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua Police , Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende , said Rep@@ orters that his officers wanted to save their station only &quot; back , because they would be attacked .
&quot; we must defend us when people dro@@ us to kill us , &quot; the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua Police , Commissioner P@@ ud@@ jo Su@@ list@@ i@@ yo , in 2015 .
&quot; it is life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more injured .
the messages about the red@@ dish came only on the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jakarta .
three weeks Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura in the sympath@@ y of sympath@@ ies to the families of victims and s@@ ware to tackle the historical abuse of Pap@@ ua .
&quot; I want that this case will be solved immediately so that there will no longer happen in the future , &quot; he said .
safety minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 that he may appeal to an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the side of the human rights violations .
but the talk started almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries occurred before a long time .
some were in the 90 @-@ s and early 2000 @-@ year @-@ old .
the point is that we are obliged to tackle these cl@@ ashes , but there are processes that you have to pass through , &quot; he said .
then Wir@@ anto did a retreat when he spoke to Jakarta on June 5 in Jakarta with TI@@ ME , and said he did not establish a complaint in Pap@@ ua .
instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said .
Wir@@ anto , accused of accused of crimes against humanity committed by the UN for crimes against humanity committed in East Tim@@ or blu@@ e@@ em independence of 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua has already been buried , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai Vor@@ um .
families of Pan@@ i@@ ai victims took such alleg@@ ations with fierce un@@ believers .
&quot; I have been inter@@ viewed in the last three years but there were no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es .
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear of fear .
&quot; I have fear , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been afraid to be arrested by the military , I &apos;m afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was defeated by the military , after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I had buried the dead , the military sought to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the shooting sessions did not hear .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
during a con@@ front@@ ation between the vill@@ agers and the managers of a ban , refused to bring a conscious man into the hospital , one person and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 year old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was dr@@ unken , when he f@@ lowed into a nearby river , died on the road to hospital .
the inhabitants of the inhabitants are protest@@ ant in front of the company &apos;s site .
the police said that the vill@@ agers threw stones on officers who responded by warning notes .
but some loc@@ als say that the mobile Brigade ( Indonesian par@@ amil@@ itary police ) began to shoot at the crowd and killing one .
&quot; we were so in pan@@ ic , we have fear that there will be reven@@ ge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u B@@ adi@@ i , who lives in the vicinity of the hospital , and witness as the last one was delivered here , so the TI@@ ME .
&quot; I have hidden two days in my house . &quot;
in addition , the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament called to withdraw the forces involved in account and to withdraw the mobile Brigade of the police from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a tur@@ bul@@ ence for the Indonesian government .
lack of sen@@ su@@ al development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua , by provo@@ king spor@@ adic attacks and kidn@@ apping of Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM guides come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Y@@ og@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ oya .
in response to the last years , thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai and arbitr@@ arily transferred in custody under the pre@@ text of the &quot; securing of the national so@@ vereig@@ n@@ ty . &quot;
some sc@@ uba diving again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; among the people in Pap@@ ua is Pan@@ i@@ ai &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice that is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for native home .
bread is just beyond range .
people build everything here , what they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potato shells .
they keep most of the harvest@@ ing harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of not@@ a tast@@ es only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 cents ) .
in the course of time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the native Pap@@ ua and the new mig@@ rants , which have arrived in larger number since the opening of new flight operations to the Nab@@ ire airport .
the few jobs , which are in the region , usually goes to the better trained and we@@ al@@ thy migran@@ t workers .
Pap@@ ua has rarely used the capital or necessary skills to competitive their own company competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in to stay in the village ... because there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ i , the Chairman of the Council of Pan@@ i@@ ai .
isolation holds the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
Moreover , limitations of coverage remain un@@ stretched upward .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Bas@@ ille Long@@ ch@@ amp were deported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although the rare permission was given to films .
according to Ph@@ el@@ im K@@ ine , the Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is constitu@@ encies , the restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and evolution , were not implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new d@@ angers for foreign journalists , trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ quiet vast provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua to report : visa ref@@ us@@ al and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said he in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of press means that the international pressure remains limited to the Indonesian government largely on the immediate neighbours pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six Pacific states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ ine islands and the Salom@@ one islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate &quot; various and widespread Viol@@ ations &quot; in Pap@@ ua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting gallery .
the same countries have historically seen the O@@ PM .
the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha Nas@@ ir rejected the alleg@@ ations of the group and told journalists in Jakarta : &quot; in Indonesia still there is a democratic system , and there are free media that it is difficult to make evidence of human rights ab@@ uses . &quot;
people want to know that more foreign governments should be aware of this .
as an official delegation from the Netherlands , attended the leadership of the Human Rights ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4 , they broke out their silence , and pushed him &quot; We want liberty &quot; in accordance with a source which also participated in the session but anonymous .
in 2003 , Indonesia paid another presidential election , but the Pap@@ ua will say that they probably will probably be able to vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i .
Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good inten@@ tions , but he is also involved of people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sch@@ äu@@ ble , &quot; says Gob@@ i , the Chairman of the Executive Council .
he wants to know that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , except that it lives under the constant thre@@ ats of a burning co@@ ag@@ ic military , is located in arm@@ ory education and health services .
Gob@@ i says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai People , such as other Pap@@ ua , have to consider her voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; debt , &quot; which he has to pay back .
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they want only righteousness . &quot;
in spite of thre@@ ats and en@@ rol@@ ment families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sh@@ uss@@ ers introduced a final symbolic A@@ id of the Trot@@ sky@@ ism : the tr@@ che of a farmer was buried in an area right opposite the police and the military station .
they know that perhaps there will never be justice to them , but at least they will not forget the persons responsible for their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with his head .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire Take the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; Wol@@ ves krat@@ zer from Dubai for the second time
a fire place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers of the world in Dubai , hundreds of inhabitants , of the 337 meters high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire that turns into the high house in just two years , which is called acci@@ dentally by the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we are standing by the fire alarm and the cry of people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50th floor to the bottom , &quot; told a resident who claimed his name as George , Reuters .
Dub@@ ais civil authorities say that units of fire fighting against 4.00 PM local time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) the fire extingu@@ ished and the buildings .
the government said they work on the provision of accommodation for those affected .
the incident may have questions about the safety of materials used in the field of high @-@ rise buildings around the world .
a study carried out by the management of the tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the largest part of damage from the covering , outside covering for decoration or insulation .
in Great Britain the police , they believe that the system of sl@@ abs for insulation and clothing at the London Gren@@ om tower in June may have contributed to the spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : next Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has fallen by its great Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the Annual General Meeting .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the Davis Cup @-@ single will not only be able to play Davis Cup @-@ single , but not supported by the required two @-@ third majority .
although often very long , but also very estimated five @-@ sentence classic will remain in the traditional competition .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of the affili@@ ates voted for reform , the objective of the IT@@ F @-@ President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty , was therefore only missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members don &apos;t have the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these ik@@ onic and historical competitions , &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty .
you will continue to work on how to improve the application .
not only for the vote , after many claims , before the proposal has come , the final on a neutral place finish .
new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively smaller Details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be able to host the host in the first round in the first round .
in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements are facilit@@ ated in the training sessions , etc. and players will have to be completed in front of the Davis Cup less official media events .
more than 1 out of 5 US passengers bring forbidden objects into the plane , finds a survey
a survey conducted among passengers carried out that more than 20 percent deliber@@ ations or un@@ aware objects at the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 per cent , which bare the airplane , while they were acci@@ dentally carried out combined knives or other objects with blades .
less than 1 per cent claimed that they had only discovered that they had gone ast@@ ray with fire@@ arms , amm@@ o or explo@@ si@@ ves .
the survey carried out more than 1,000 people - which was carried out by a Jet @-@ Char@@ ter@@ service , the Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , it also noted that younger trav@@ ellers could ab@@ dic@@ ate the rules .
of those question@@ ed that they have been trying to fly with something to fly with something that were banned by T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 per cent Mill@@ enni@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent , were members of Generation X .
the most common objects which have been inten@@ tional to T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent said to have known objects with blades by security control while 2.2 percent of female respon@@ dents and 3.7 percent of the male respon@@ dents also confirmed that they had been deliber@@ ately banned drugs into the aircraft .
the company said that travelers had asked trav@@ ellers in the whole country to find out how many ver@@ acci@@ dentally Schm@@ ug@@ g@@ ware caused by the airport security and had done many things .
it is not a surprise that people who are enjoying on the est sm@@ ug@@ g@@ ware - wis@@ ely or ignor@@ ant - through security , those who were most frequently flying .
however , the company indicates that the T@@ SA guidelines are slightly complicated and conf@@ using .
the people are often uns@@ af@@ e to take liquids , or how much of it is .
so there is no surprise that the largest quantity of all objects used by T@@ SA .
for a long time , people thought that T@@ SA could view books as dirt product .
liquids are permitted in domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k is no matter : tens of thousands of Tesla customers
electric thous@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k is available with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tesla &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
he has so far under@@ gone , that part of the customer has withdrawn its binding reservation again .
apart from the always triumph@@ ant figures to increase sales and even more strongly , Tesla chef El@@ on Mus@@ k showed another one , less gl@@ itter@@ ing number : the cancellations made during the new mass market model 3 .
Mus@@ k had frequently asked more than 500,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car in the past few months , whose delivery begins .
Mus@@ k is now being carried out : from the altogether 5@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders of 63@@ ,000 have been withdrawn again .
critics always noted that it is only a non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of cancellation , Tesla cost the € 1000 ( in the US 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; booking fee &quot; completely back .
currently , 45@@ 5,000 of these non @-@ binding reservations are involved in a telephone conference with anal@@ ysts .
however , the Tesla boss could not believe that the cancellation of so far could not be about twelve percent of all orders .
his argument is that the challenge with the ambitious growth targets are not affected by demand , but on the production site .
Tesla 8@@ 4,000 vehicles delivered last year .
in 2018 it is supposed to complete all models - 500,000 will be one million .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , there are only 1800 reservations per day .
those who today ordered a &quot; Model 3 &quot; must be reck@@ oned in the second half of 2018 with the extra@@ dition - if Tesla manages to use his n@@ ag@@ el@@ new , never in practice tested building roads without major interrup@@ tions with maximum utilization .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
but it comes to larger del@@ ays , then the refuse to become a problem for Tesla .
because then , the company cannot hin@@ der the customer &apos;s satisfied customers in pairs .
EPA CEO P@@ ru@@ itt is moving back due to the reduction of the rules of the Obama Er@@ a to reduce emissions
one day after he had been lam@@ inated by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , head of the Environmental Protection Agency , had its former decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions of smo@@ g caused by air pollut@@ ants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change when his agency proved to meet the requirements of government agencies against re@@ ac@@ ity than previous administration .
he mentioned not the complaint lodged against his prior place in a Federal Court of Appeal .
this is a deadline which ran on October 1 for states to comply with the 2015 level ozone standard .
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would assume compliance with a year to study the plan to study the plan to study plan and avoid economic growth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in local decisions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was in front of his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump , At@@ tor@@ ney of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a long time a reliable opponent on environmental protection regulations .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ sted repe@@ ats to block regulatory statements , rep@@ lic@@ ate or delayed , that the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels have been rep@@ aid .
the sudden change from Wednesday is the youngest legal retreat for the P@@ ru@@ sion of regulatory approvals agenda .
last month , a Federal Court of Appeals decided that the EPA @-@ administrator has exceeded its authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , oil and gas companies to monitor the monitoring and reducing of methane le@@ cks .
on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt proposed that his transfer of ozone in ozone standard is simply the read@@ iness of EPA for co @-@ operation with the states through the complex process of current compliance with the current standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under previous administration , the EPA often did not maintain the dead@@ lines for performing activists and other charges , and in an agreement the appointment for implementation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who def@@ endant the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in a regulation by jurisdiction , and we take dead@@ lines .
we also accept the law and authority that gives us seriously . &quot;
however , the opinion of the EPA asser@@ ted that P@@ ru@@ gs will eventually use his &quot; powers to delay and all other legal services available to ensure that the regulations &quot; are based on a solid policy and best available information . &quot;
the Republi@@ can Congress runs on a more comprehensive re@@ version of the ozone rules .
a last month approval is scheduled to implement the rules of 2015 by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet made a vote in the Senate .
in the New York General At@@ tor@@ ney Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of the States , who had pro@@ claim the EPA in this week , said the Group intends to just@@ ify the legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of EPA - according to our complaints - is an important profit for health and security of these 6,7 million new Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans that are affected directly from Smo@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York joined this case California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ sy@@ l@@ van@@ ien , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
ground @-@ Oz@@ on arises if pollut@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemicals and other sources are react to sunlight .
the standing smo@@ g can cause serious breathing problems to serious respir@@ atory problems and contribute to thousands of premature death deaths each year .
representatives of the public health being and the environ@@ ment@@ alists celebrated over P@@ ru@@ ong@@ ated course of course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is wor@@ r@@ ying how much pressure it takes to bre@@ athe this sen@@ sible step by the person responsible for the protection of the air that we bre@@ athe in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d vom Center for Bi@@ ological Diversity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight against the ide@@ ological cross of the Tr@@ ump government to fight against environmental cont@@ amin@@ ants and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

according to the wording of the document after the Tum@@ lingen mountain apart from the one parish church , the parish church , or patron saint , belonged to the church , or the patron saint .
so there stayed people there .

the Pat@@ ron@@ ats@@ right was created from the early medieval O@@ il@@ enk@@ ir@@ chen@@ law .
one Lord , who built a church , and remained with a priest , continued to keep his church , and he could also inherit these animals .
this was linked to a priest , or to the bishop a new priest .
three altars were in the church and two bells in the tower .
the bigger one of the two zer@@ st at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell was first mentioned in 16@@ 92 , but was later to be released during World War II in 1942 .
in the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 1648 ) the plates were wrapped up and the bells were stolen .
the roof was un@@ dense .
in 1796 French troops arrived near the church .
they removed the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used it as a burning wood .
the remains of the church threatened to overthrow 1809 .
until 1869 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius C@@ emetery served as the last resting place for the dead from hearing .
in 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demolished .
just the tower was left .
in the New Year of 1834 , a storm split the steep@@ le tower and the half collap@@ sed .
to prevent an evil , the tower was broken off .

Verein wants to test permission from wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not see a legal prer@@ equ@@ is@@ ite for the construction and has therefore turned to the Coun@@ cill@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CDU ) is asked to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is illegal .
the association argu@@ ed that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette gar can have been approved without wind turbines , as at the time in Vier@@ sen , a wind force at the border of Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal has existed .
within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , at the same time , the concentration zone provides a exclusion of wind power for the rest of the urban area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these zones are supposed to prevent a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saving &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although a few days ago , the town had decided a second wind force zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette - which had not been approved by the Düsseldorf District government , because of a lack of form@@ ality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the lack of planning a prer@@ equ@@ is@@ ite prer@@ equ@@ is@@ ite the approval of approval , according to illegal and therefore , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ kens , Chairman of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the current state of things : the Municipal Council approved again the wind@@ concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette ; a approval of the District government still stands out .
Er@@ asmus : &quot; this is the creation of a approval for the construction of wind turbines planned by copyright . &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance to the request .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letter has been entered in the circle of Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained a speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circuit takes you to the occasion of testing the matter again .
but they are not expected to do that the procedure is stopped .
with a view of the ongoing trial at the Administ@@ rative Court , the circle on Thursday would not imp@@ lies with regards to the arg@@ um@@ entation of the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ home &quot; .
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , is planning on an area at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette to build four meters high wind turbines .
already last year , the company , which is involved in the town of Vier@@ sen , took part in lease contracts with the owner of approximately 65 hectares of land .
the power requirement of around 11 400 households can be covered with the construction of the four wind turbines , which is equivalent to one fifth of the electricity needs of all four thousand households .
NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
in the past summer there were fourth light to purchase three wind turbines at the wind farm Lin@@ ni@@ ch at Aachen and a stake in a wind energy plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district Hein@@ sberg .

also attractive offers on Saturday and the tax on parking fees on that day are part of the concept .

Tr@@ ump put under pressure from telephone calls to Mexico under pressure because of payment of the bound@@ ary wall
tran@@ scription of telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders from Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on January 27 , Tr@@ ump called for a phone call with the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto , to announce publicly that he would not pay for a planned limit wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the U.S. President affir@@ med him because he had publicly denied the wall in public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t say the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump launched its presidential campaign with the promise to establish a wall on the southern border of the USA , and s@@ ware , Mexico for the project .
tran@@ scription of his first recru@@ itment with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ table were also released and un@@ veil an en@@ cl@@ amped exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump said , Mr. Tr@@ ump said to take over that a trade for the United States , who convey@@ ed to Australia , was &quot; sm@@ iling &quot; and &quot; stup@@ id &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was convey@@ ed by the government Obama would look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after it had proposed a ban on the transformation of refugees to the United States .
Mr. Tr@@ ump finished the call after he had said to Mr. Turn@@ soon , &quot; that is the most common call for the whole day . &quot;
Moo@@ res Ford massacre : activ@@ ist rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice again
a 1948 @-@ year @-@ old Ford Mercury passed through a group of viewers in rural Monroe , Georgia , and moved to the Ford Bridge of Moore .
before the car had four black passengers and a white driver that could reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with ri@@ ots to block his way .
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a man middle age in a needle @-@ strike - took a long train on his cig@@ ar , looking through the wind@@ shield .
inside the in@@ mates in fear .
&quot; we want this n -@@ --- r Roger ! &quot; br@@ ushed the man .
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
he cri@@ es torn in silence , when a young man painted a young man from the passenger seat .
fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on July 22 , was only a reproduction .
but if a snare is thrown around the neck of &quot; Roger &quot; , nearly all of them in the audience are very genuine sig@@ h .
since 2005 , civil rights came back to Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge , in the two black pairs - Roger and Doro@@ thy Mal@@ com , as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey from K@@ u Kl@@ ux Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one has ever been indicted for murder .
&quot; it is really un@@ constitutional that in all these years we have not been arrested in all these years - although we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks that helps with the organization of re@@ alities .
&quot; it is a dirt on a history , but it is a burden of our souls . &quot;
Bro@@ oks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former Congress of Georgia and a life by civil rights .
it serves as a dramatic call for acting as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual memory of the Monroe community that an in@@ justice was never corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want prosec@@ utions , we want the termination , we want to conc@@ iliation , but first we must receive righteousness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can not get to healing and reconciliation until we receive righteousness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a beg@@ ining medi@@ ator leads a beg@@ ging of the suffering from the victims of Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ chens on July 27 , 1946 .
according to FB@@ I files that were received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process .
but nobody was ever indicted .
although the susp@@ ects remain on the free foot for decades , civil rights say that the double motivation for Lyn@@ ch @-@ actions in the whole city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision made by the Supreme Court rendered its vote for the first time in Georgia to aband@@ on their voice in the summer .
about the same time as the election , according to the FB@@ I of the black Far@@ mp@@ ter Roger Mal@@ com , a white ground @-@ owner , Bar@@ kind H@@ ester , descended on a woman , supp@@ os@@ edly for a woman .
Bro@@ oks said the rum@@ our in the city was that H@@ ester who sli@@ pped with mal@@ com@@ s wife Doro@@ thy slept and that the baby , which she bore , was not of her husband .
on July 25 , 1946 Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent real estate owner , 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the FB@@ I .
he was accompanied by Doro@@ thy and her cou@@ sins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey in prison .
but when she went away from the prison , the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge collap@@ sed , Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b reached the car .
&quot; as it states , it was Har@@ rison who prepared the Mor@@ de and arranged it , &quot; conclu@@ des this from a FB@@ I report . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspi@@ racy between the government and local prosecution which was not only involved in the mor@@ den , evidence and identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bro@@ oks do it form@@ ulate it even more fun .
&quot; it was a vot@@ al massacre , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to register and vote when you vote , then you will happen here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for almost one decade Cass@@ and@@ ra Gre@@ ens re@@ directed the annual reproduction of Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their representation is descrip@@ tive , del@@ im@@ ing , and is justified in a kind of deep R@@ ass@@ ism , many believed that he doesn &apos;t exist in America anymore .
it is hard to watch , and yet more difficult , but Gre@@ ene said that the point is .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not want to speak about the Lyn@@ ch , because we were con@@ fron@@ ted with his reliability in us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I cannot build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or want to hear what I have done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and the first day pushed almost 30 actors - a dozen White and the rest Black - in a room and listening to a well @-@ installed survey of the piece started .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a co @-@ director here .
he played the role of the Chief C@@ lan@@ der &apos;s role for years , but he said , the role will never be easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I didn &apos;t like that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it is very important to get this story alive because we would not want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room , the actor D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sh@@ aw and Nick Ras@@ cona , the Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett , play their lines .
the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester cri@@ es and pushed him , w@@ ager that he sli@@ pped with his wife Doro@@ thy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , n --- he , win@@ dy of my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shaving wi@@ ches the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in a der@@ ision .
Gre@@ ens laugh@@ s at the wat@@ cht@@ est .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; said S@@ cona .
it is al@@ im@@ pover@@ ished and conf@@ used .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; Gre@@ ene said , &quot; still alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that white people back then &apos; n &apos; n &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but , &quot; wit@@ ness@@ ing one of the other black actors .
&quot; you just need to meet the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
and exactly the energy is moving in the room , a feeling of camera body replaces the dis@@ comfort .
everyone is busy doing this right , not only because of the game but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene starts again .
this time , when shaving says the N word , he says it sharp , and with im@@ print .
absolutely no man laugh .
this repet@@ ition ends and fast .
there are cri@@ es , shots , and then silence .
a woman , clothed with a mourning @-@ dress , stands above the course of the actors and leads Billi@@ e Holidays Trau@@ ern@@ de Lo@@ bre@@ de &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot;
their voice breaks out at every second word .
about one hundred meters behind it is a group of about four dozen people swe@@ at and tears from the eyes .
the audience is almost evenly between black and white .
one pair is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many are coming only down the road .
they all experiences almost eight hours of Geor@@ gi@@ as , when Bro@@ oks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of the mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to that point , the Mor@@ de have stayed a ne@@ c@@ ash@@ ote , but now if you were on the same country where Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feels complete .
when the last notes of the song , Gre@@ ens loads the quantity to come closer and inspec@@ ting the dead bodies .
children ho@@ cks on their heads , register the f@@ ake blood , and the silent body and whis@@ per one another .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mur@@ m@@ ur is a small boy , as if he would like to remember it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes the Gre@@ ene of the crowd - and suddenly there is over .
the actor cast off the Lyn@@ x eil and wi@@ pe her tears .
Brad@@ sh@@ aw um@@ ar@@ mt Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit who played the C@@ lan@@ member .
Nick Ras@@ cona um@@ ar@@ mt two of his players and breaks them together in their arms , the emotional load of the performance finally breaks through it .
&quot; it is okay , &quot; whis@@ per@@ ed one of the women .
&quot; we know that this is not in your heart .
you did that for a reason . &quot;
later the audience uses the actors for dinner together .
at a table , a white pair of Atlanta was excited about the setting of a black pair that they &apos;ve just learned .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ ski fought against this , words to inv@@ ent words which did feel the performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to hear these terrible words and deeds ... of people that look like yourself and do that , because they look like it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what really is doing with me , believe me that the Lyn@@ x is still going on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today this is called a police @-@ shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks courtyard keeps on his table in the same room , he reminds us of the civil rights .
he said he had begun to start the performance in the next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the presentation is inspir@@ ing in a certain way , because it describes the terror of what we have to bear , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s so if we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whoever does not study his own story , who does not know his own story , is condemned to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; god@@ tw@@ il@@ ight &quot; reconc@@ iled the Wag@@ n@@ eri@@ ans in Bayreuth
also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental works , director Frank Cast@@ orf reli@@ es on a bun@@ e @-@ fri@@ vol@@ e st@@ aging in front of a gigantic , six @-@ story scenes .
the la@@ b@@ ühne ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) presents a tra@@ geous street corner , Wall Street and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pl@@ aste and El@@ aste &quot; logo from DDR times or New York Stock Exchange .
before , an open Mercedes @-@ vintage car , in which the Rhine k@@ ills as a rock@@ erg@@ ir@@ l , or alternatively a Is@@ etta .
the oil waters remember Cast@@ or@@ fs leit@@ mot@@ iv - money , power and G@@ ier - which is moving through its &quot; ring . &quot;
the three Rhine k@@ ills - sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ eel , Wi@@ eb@@ ke L@@ ehm@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra Steiner - harmon@@ ize as in the Rhein@@ gold . &quot;
then they lead to Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , cr@@ ushed into the trunk into the trunk into the trunk , and give the Kra@@ wall@@ o @-@ Cli@@ que .
Stephen M@@ illing is singing the del@@ ight@@ ful Hagen , which surro@@ unds the A@@ ura of a heavy punching bag .
brutal scene , when he proposes to Siegfried .
later it still has to believe Gun@@ ther ( Markus Oak ) .
the audience than@@ ked the ensemble with powerful appl@@ ause .
F@@ ost@@ er , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke , and conductor Jan@@ owski , who hum@@ bled himself a hum@@ ble and hands to the Merkel @-@ smo@@ ker .
big appl@@ ause there is for the festival orchestra that shows the first time on stage - in view of the great heat back in Leg@@ erer leisure wear .
the appearance of Frank Cast@@ orf and his regional team had been expected with tension .
in 2013 , he still had to leave a member of the Pfei@@ f@@ Concerto in 2013 , there were five years later , in which the cov@@ eted &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; ru@@ fe left .
Katharina Wagner is likely to have a look forward .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we noticed that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a certain way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had said shortly before the performance of d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience did not only have a form of peace with Cast@@ ile , but it was also a understanding of his vision .
I draw a positive conclusion .
max amount works as volunteers .
they work in their volunte@@ er year in several locations .
where to everywhere ?
amount : usually in stone house at the furniture fair , once a week I help here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I &apos;ve already worked in the open day of the school .
how are your experiences with this ?
amount : it is a beautiful , wide spectrum I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years old , a late @-@ late volunte@@ er .
how does that come ?
quantity : I tried S@@ LC .
and then , a civil engineering , let &apos;s say , successfully interrupted .
I have known for me that it is for me and I want to make something different with people .
and then I asked me what are you doing .
make a social year since there is an insight , since it is possible to see how it is spot , at the focal point maybe even , really is .
and was it like that ?
amount : I have collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in social work in the winter semester .
I will study dual , probably in the Youth Office Her@@ ne , a social worker training and study at Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences .
is it not unusual to have several different application areas during the volunte@@ er Service ?
amount : yes , it is very variable .
it always happens to be where you will be the FS@@ J .
it can make it possible from the age of age to youth - in all possible facets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was also partially in the night , so in the afternoon support .
for me , that was exactly the right , what has irrit@@ ated me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really runs out .
differently than in civil engineering ?
quantity : sure that you are not going to expect st@@ ati@@ ken .
you always have other people about the head , each with a completely different story behind him .
whether a refugee is brought to a youth who has been picked out of the family - you must always go down individually .
very interesting .
and they had no touch anxi@@ ous ?
quantity : I &apos;m not the guy .
it is a area that gives a lot .
lots of love , great kindness .
there is also negative moments , but so that &apos;s life .

the bombing of violence is the last violent crimes committed to Afghanistan that month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul .
in an opinion from Nato , the explosion was done on Thursday night when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afghan army was attacked by a &quot; of people with impro@@ vised explo@@ si@@ ves . &quot;
the statement states that all the last in a stable condition are located and in the US military hospital in Bag@@ ram will be treated .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a concern for NATO troops at the nearby Bag@@ ram .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties in Afghanistan during the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide bus station killed at least 30 people in a ch@@ op of Kabul .

on May 31 , a massive bombar@@ d@@ ment in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest mil@@ it@@ ants attack in the country , the Taliban kick@@ ed off from power since 2001 .
violence under@@ scores the prec@@ ari@@ ous security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering the number of U.S. troops to support the military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that the suicide attacks in Kabul in the last weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , their policy and in particular in the reputation of President Ash@@ raf Gh@@ ani .
EPA Ret@@ ur@@ ry to delay the Smo@@ g Rule to Kl@@ agen
the US @-@ American environmental protection authority has made a decision to delayed by the government of Obama to delayed the states that smo@@ g @-@ caused emissions to be challenged . this was a day after 15 States accused the agency because of the stri@@ de .
the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to drive the so @-@ called &quot; Oz@@ on@@ regulations 2015 , &quot; and said they show the obligation of the agency that work with states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in the dialogue with and that we react to our government partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA CEO Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of EPA , the ozone regulations , which are to be measured in a part of the country &apos;s pollut@@ ant emissions in order to submit an stric@@ ter quality standards - to delayed one year until October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , together with the District of Colombia , was filed on Tuesday , and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump tried to impos@@ e a wide range of environmental awareness that the former President Barack Obama has imposed on a wider agenda that should boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump &apos;s economic growth .
however , the efforts have triggered the impact of the Democrats and Nature reserves , which concerns about impact of larger emissions to public health .
the EPA website says that the in@@ hal@@ ation of air , the ozone contains &quot; the lung function and enh@@ ancing the respir@@ atory sympt@@ om , &quot; as for example as@@ thma .
joint venture to shared space
in the end , the decision was clear : in two counter @-@ vote , the Municipal Council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ d decides to set up a joint venture in the future of the future .
before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the lack of property is signed , Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden reports .
although it is still last until the church community has been established itself until now there is no planning for planning for a private investor .
there is a discussion concerning a shared space .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat has been offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would have a living space of approximately 55 square meters - and a ad@@ joining terrace with 70 square meters floor space for a special price .
the administration and majority of the Community &apos;s collective , such a common room is not considered to be meeting point for the residents of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ ous living area , but open to the congregation .
as an example , the word from &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; made the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision will be decided by providing funding for the current budget last autumn by conveying possibilities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the construction is in the renovation area .
the installation of a community space would be reported as reported T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent eligible .
the qu@@ en@@ schlag sees to sign@@ alize the investor that is le@@ aning between the legs in this regard , the conclusion that both ar@@ tic@@ le@@ - - what the hook @-@ height reduces and the construction of an economic power - which would be possible .
un@@ necessarily , not only Wil@@ fried S@@ oh@@ mer , be this supplement .
if it helps : unanimously he passes the board .
it is not so easy for the joint room .
Daniela &quot; &quot; Daniela &quot; refers to the many own buildings , with which you do not go right now , it is now at the common room from the window , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do hard to make me hard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ v@@ onne Sta@@ iger speaks absolutely for the community space , but absolutely against a municipal participation .
it looks behind that a maximinum payout of resist@@ ive or even Foreign Invest@@ ors .
this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the area , you may not give a sub@@ sid@@ y , but get a real , in the case of a doubt , the counter @-@ speech is .
Sta@@ ig@@ ers request , de@@ pl@@ ating the decision , finds three fears .
so it remains in two counter@@ parts at the original program , the Stefan H@@ aller thus summar@@ ises : &quot; if we put the decision to summar@@ ise a huge step in our infrastructure . &quot;

that was not good . &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in a power increase in the first official mandatory match of the season .
&quot; football is also tac@@ tics , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have large confidence that my team shows these qualities .

star Am@@ ber covered in the star of Stern
in the Harz mountains the nationwide first &quot; star@@ red ad &quot; will arise .
this is planning the Club Observatory Saint Andre@@ as@@ berg .
it has been a planet route in Göttingen - since 2003 .
one &quot; star@@ ring path &quot; come to meet the needs of many Har@@ z@@ visited ers , it was called .
he Connec@@ ting Nature , Science , Movement and Sports performance .
members want to set up along the planned route boards and inform about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
in the first phase until 2018 , the association &quot; well reached installations to five to six locations &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z .
in@@ qu@@ in@@ quired St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ e@@ ge@@ i@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the tablets are to be supplemented by Internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the site selection , a good mobile network reception is played . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Acc@@ essi@@ bility is a crit@@ erion .
later the star@@ path train should be extended by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star@@ path you will learn a lot of knowing about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , they learned why stars had different colors or why a star was stronger than another , although it is much more far away .
then , in which constellation can be found himself a selected star and when he is best to see .
the association has been operating at the Berg@@ amo Saint Andre@@ as@@ berg since 2014 , the highest situated in Northern Germany .
according to the German National Park , the resin is based on the Federal Office of Nature Conservation and the six dar@@ k@@ est regions in Germany .
often from the Mil@@ ky Way galax@@ y and even the Andro@@ med@@ a galax@@ y with naked eye are clearly visible .
in the Uni @-@ Stadt has existed since 2003 on the initiative of the framework of Plan@@ et@@ arium Göttingen , something similar to the planned star section - the planet .
beginning with the Hotel in Goethe &apos;s alle@@ e that forms the interior of our solar system , the planet runs up to Hain@@ berg and the ob@@ servatory and a &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( congregation of Gl@@ eichen ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the ri@@ mp@@ s with the single planets - including the d@@ warf sh@@ u@@ to at the end point - are positioned exactly at the distance and a scale of one to two billion .
the earth sh@@ run@@ k up to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter , while the sun is exactly 75 metres away , the sun is 70 centi@@ metres tall .
the total distance of the planet is about four kilometers .
during the light from Sun to Pl@@ u@@ to about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to go with Pl@@ u@@ to .
pedestri@@ ans are therefore faster than the light in the world .
the march to the next fixation would take another half year .
Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o meet for the first time , discuss a possible show down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o and Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia , who stand in a coll@@ ision to get the most exciting pit match in the near future at 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN @-@ offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ proposed World Box@@ ing Council Ligh@@ tweight Champion to gre@@ et the hall@@ way to gre@@ et Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o , the World Box@@ ing organization Super @-@ Feder@@ weight champion .
after Gar@@ ci@@ as victory through one @-@ part decision on the former Four @-@ divisions world champion Adri@@ en Br@@ oner on Saturday to Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the Top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ List .
Gar@@ cia stretched forth his right hand , and said , &quot; How is it to you ?
I wish you a good luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o defended his belt against Miguel , aga on Saturday evening at 19 o &apos;clock on ES@@ PN .
when the pair was pos@@ ing for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Klim@@ as noted that a possible show down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect size &quot; order . &quot;
&quot; I am a former spring @-@ weight , &quot; remin@@ ded Gar@@ cia .
&quot; I got up for Br@@ oner &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I am not so big .
I am small for 140 .
I want to change light weight .
and he must move in light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
this will require the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o voted .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot;
the climate asked if it should be to pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy , the Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o , with a 135 pound debut in that year , to arrange the battle against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their lightweight @-@ weight campaign in the forum on September 23rd .
&quot; this struggle could take place in Pay @-@ per @-@ View Mode , because all fans have asked after him , &quot; said Gar@@ cia and pressed later to fight for the network that offers the best financial package .
we are the best .
no other names can produce this type of attention .
when always they are ready ... &quot;
Gar@@ cia said , he sh@@ y Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday battle .
but Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o stayed with the gener@@ ously praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he think of the tri@@ athlon champion out of River@@ side , I &apos;m sorry for Mik@@ ey ... you wanted to make me the Ko @-@ Out . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said , the focus is to show impact strength , then boxing .
they said they could feel the Mom@@ entum , which he built up for his own struggle .
&quot; this is the struggle that must be carried out .
no other struggle makes so much attention and enthusiasm .
I am more than happy to work , &quot; said Gar@@ cia .
Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o said : &quot; I have waited for the top com@@ bat@@ ants , and this is Mik@@ ey .
it will be a great struggle . &quot;
four last according to ty@@ re board
an accident on the A7 were injured and injured four people in the afternoon .
after the first information , the driver of a Opel Z@@ af@@ ira lost against 4.@@ 30 , shortly before the connecting point in the market , probably according to a ty@@ re plat@@ ter , control over his vehicle .
the car sh@@ ook to the right into the f@@ ake , where he over@@ threw himself and then lying on the roof in the grave .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were badly damaged during the accident .
during the first supply of the last through the emergency service the A7 was closed in direction north for about an hour , subsequently the traffic on the left lane could be settled at the accident .
Fort@@ unas Hoffmann : &quot; turning chain works better &quot;
Andr@@ e Hoffmann hopes for the 2 : 2 season open@@ er against Br@@ uns@@ wick , that optimi@@ zes the optim@@ isation of the def@@ ences in Au@@ e .
with the first season of the season , Andr@@ e Hoffmann was happy with the result , as not the two oppos@@ ites were at the 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; these were two oppos@@ ites too much , and we have to fit in Au@@ e even better , &quot; says the defense of Fortuna Düsseldorf .
in the Erz@@ gebirge the Dre@@ w chain is supposed to be further optimized .
and a gate after a exemp@@ tion , the f@@ ences do not want to capture even more .
&quot; for the future , there will be so no longer next to Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line . &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his crew is better right in preparation with the turning chain , than with the quadru@@ ple .
&quot; still don &apos;t I know how we operate in Au@@ e , &quot; says his Trainer Fried@@ helm Radio el , but Hoffmann is certainly in his cause , &quot; because we just entered the rotating chain on the semi@@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko G@@ ie@@ ß@@ mann players who can build up well . &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the condition is , but that we are even better harmon@@ ize and we don &apos;t aff@@ ord to do so many ab@@ uses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course Hoffmann also goes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you cannot speak for a failure , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the performance could be quite okay , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we will be able to concentrate on Sunday with four points and we will certainly be able to show us from an ordinary season open@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of these , his trainer wanted nothing to know .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start into the season is only after six to eight game days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fried@@ helm Radio , who doesn &apos;t want to talk about an advantage against au@@ e , only because the game of the Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be canc@@ eled due to an im@@ pregn@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now they can begin the season virtually with a home play , &quot; said Radio and Hoffmann , that the player from Au@@ e might possibly be something of fresh , since they could have no heavier and complete game like Fortuna against an asc@@ ension favorite in the bones .
&quot; but they don &apos;t know about 100 percent , where they are currently standing , &quot; says the inner defender of the Fortuna .
the guests come from the Rhineland as a lighter favorite on Sunday in the encounter at the last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we are able to go away , only because we have the right to come under the first six , is Bl@@ ö@@ mad@@ ness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is at only a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games quite positive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is no crew in the 2nd Bundesliga , which you have to hit from pre@@ set , &quot; explains the continuation of the Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such a statement would be ar@@ ro@@ gant and superior . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so Funk@@ el wants to experience his players on Sunday at no fall .
new results of the Swedish asylum @-@ evaluation tests published
the latest results of testing for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which were subjected to a new method for the medical evaluation of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested people are older than 18 years , but not everyone may believe on the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authority for For@@ en@@ ian Medicine ( Ri@@ fi@@ bre@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) has started the implementation of tests last year .
they should be more precise during the asylum process for the assessment of the age , after the Swedish migration Authority ( Mig@@ r@@ ations ) was critic@@ ized for failure in the assessment of the correct age of some refugees .
until today , Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ verk@@ et has sent 6,@@ 880 to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 481 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were evaluated as 18 or older , while in further 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency stated that the person was &quot; probably 18 years or older . &quot;
in 432 cases , the conclusion was that the person is &quot; possibly under 18 years old . &quot;
tests are only carried out in cases where the age of the person is challenged .
according to Johan G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are resistant to recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no significant difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are quite constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high percentage of cases in which the person was judged as more than 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ ers has weighed over his age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in May , the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that it was 4@@ 42 cases , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; propose that the person was 18 years old or older . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the paper sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bl@@ a@@ det published the results published in the 5@@ 81 , she found that in 243 of these cases the person said that it would be 18 years old in 243 of these cases .
the method of medical age condem@@ nation , in the rays of wisdom teeth , and M@@ RT shots of knee @-@ joints , which are analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , was also critic@@ ised in some areas .
a sk@@ ep@@ ti@@ cian is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of Kar@@ ol@@ inska Institut , whose work comprises the assessment of biological maturity of people , to see if they were earlier or later than usual through the pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t believe that the type of measurement should be used .
to assess the biological age in this way , is very un@@ certain .
if we cannot say it , we should not do so if we could do it , &quot; he said to the newspaper Metro .
however , G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency def@@ ending the accuracy of tests : &quot; in general you can say that the risk of using a child is un@@ correct .
the largest risk is in this case when the person is less than 18 , in this case this is roughly 10 percent . &quot;
full in Plan
the work on the three bridges of Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg come well .
on Wednesday , seven tons of heavy concrete participated in the bridge at the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good in time , it runs great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , Building Manager at the Department of Road Traffic and Transport in the government office at Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April the work started at the same time in all three sub@@ jection bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building is fore@@ seen for October and is sure that the schedule is adher@@ ed to .
the first bridge , by Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads through the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a v@@ aul@@ ted bridge made of concrete , which is lined with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4,@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
like the other bridges , it is now come to the years now .
to ensure stability and traffic reliability , the three buildings are thoroughly re@@ developed .
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built in red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were erected in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 meters long .
the bridge at the entrance entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach now has received a 1,@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons heavy so @-@ called Br@@ ück@@ enk@@ ie .
this is an edge version , which is used as operating mode .
on Friday , the southern part of the bridge is to be fitted with a width of 2,@@ 20 metres wide .
then the pedestrian way goes out .
the particular thing is that it is part of the finished parts , a patent in the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge arms .
particular your finger@@ print experience has the ver@@ aging of lines due to the structure in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a glass fibre cable where many companies are joined .
the residents were informed of the project by hand bal@@ lot .
at first fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished .
the bridges between the building farm and the collecting feed in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg is governed by traffic through a traffic light .
construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ b@@ acher &apos;s entrance is the street in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den . &quot;
the costs for the three bri@@ dging operations amount to 700 000 euros .
the whole is financed through the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : protest in protest at Germany potato salad
it is not so frequently used to draw parties on a strand but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , comes together , what else is difficult to make a hat .
the parties ( CDU , SPD , Grün@@ e , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Lin@@ ke ) belong to a broad alliance , which indicates that day peace@@ fully flag , because the Mand@@ D is in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle R@@ ond@@ ell as loud as the poster of a large election campaign .
and known names at the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who forms the leader together with Alexander Gau@@ land , the leading duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the Deputy President Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are already hours before the event , don &apos;t want to listen to the Af@@ D errors , but demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot;
originally the town pic@@ nic was planned under the motto &quot; All on a table &quot; on the well place , but now it takes place on the parking below the R@@ ond@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colorful picture that offers it .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair@@ woman of the For@@ ums One World and one of the principal organizers , really pleased : &quot; great , how many people are joined here . &quot;
there are music and plenty of food , including a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German potato salad which could easily eat the Af@@ D without any problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police sent many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence above all also at the railway station , which is only a few metres away from the venues .
how did the Mand@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes from the Af@@ D volcan@@ ei@@ fel reported that he has ende@@ av@@ oured to get such an event and get the surcharge .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf first performed in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us church there is not enough parking available .
well , the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ pes is looking forward that &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is the good right of people , main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also does it : on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz a band for entertainment , in the Stad@@ thalle several speakers , among them the Rhineland @-@ car@@ rot Af@@ D leader Uwe boy .
in the room there are about 200 list@@ eners , who are waiting to wait for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Deputy Chairman Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch &apos;s Spe@@ ech@@ es .
the police forces remained unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening .
a little more than one hour takes the Af@@ D event , guests on the subur@@ b have a longer breath , but also there is a short time after 21 clock .
the police can decorate - none special inci@@ dents .
tromb@@ one strikes trumpet
a ren@@ unci@@ ation with the Wolf@@ acher tromb@@ onist Freder@@ ic Bell@@ i is there in the row of Has@@ l@@ acher monastery concerts tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 o &apos;clock in the monastery church .
together with the Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he is a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or even &quot; Bal@@ kan@@ fol@@ klore &quot; meets classical German education with roots in the wind music .
both sol@@ o@@ ists are winners and awar@@ dees of numerous international cont@@ ests and have held solo positions in European leading branches .
for instance , Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic Bell@@ i is Sol@@ op@@ os@@ aun@@ ching the SWR Symphony Orchestra .
both combines the lust , not only the limits on their instruments , but also merge the limits of different gen@@ res .
Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new look , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music &quot; together with Bulgarian fol@@ klore , and in a piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the Jazz@@ ech@@ op@@ re@@ ist@@ itor Nils W@@ ash , ming@@ led with classic , jazz , and free playing for an amazing work of art .
this core of the program was first performed in Spring with huge success in Freiburg .
Nils W@@ ash &apos;s renowned composer Nils W@@ ake wrote it for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ l@@ acher monastery church with their special acou@@ st@@ ics is deliber@@ ately drawn into the concert with their special acou@@ st@@ ics .

but I would like to try everything , &quot; Kri@@ sten Stewart is very open on their bis@@ exual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I cook in gr@@ illed cheese I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next to next ? &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the probably most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood star was the &quot; tw@@ il@@ ight &quot; colleague Robert Patt@@ inson , which ultimately went out bitter .
despite all this , the brun@@ ette of the brun@@ ette facing the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was in love with seriously , whom I did .
or do you think , I have played it ? &quot;
after their separation there was Kri@@ sten to ab@@ is@@ exual : &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed to believe .
so it has never conf@@ used me or ham@@ pers .
I never liked it never to be taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; b@@ ang show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in the school @-@ time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in the school @-@ time , when they rather dar@@ ed like a Bu@@ b : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this really was very hurt .
when I was eleven told me the children , I would look like a bu@@ b .
I really attacked and attacked and damaged .
well , I look back and remember : &apos; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the public they do not glad@@ ly love their love : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people expect you in a certain manner and den@@ ounces me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some can mark me more than und@@ ank@@ ets , but I don &apos;t like to just@@ ify me before the whole public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
governor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
the democratic Govern@@ or of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday night at a demonstration with President Tr@@ ump , that he will change the party .
whether you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; governor Justice .
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and much more thinking ... today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you when I am a democratic party . &quot;
the rally broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as a trainer I would say that it is at the time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised before a HU@@ GE announcement in the West Virginia Rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice approved not the democratic candidate of Hill@@ ary Clinton .
Justice , who is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
Forbes is certain that he possesses carbon@@ em@@ ines in five states , and inher@@ ited a carbon business by his father .
it is worth 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee issued a statement on Thursday evening , in which it said : &quot; the party change of Govern@@ or Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party that would rather go over it to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 members and the control of the f@@ ew@@ est laws in history is the announcement of Govern@@ or Justice only the last re@@ jection of a party , which is not able to find a positive , subject message , &quot; said the R@@ NC @-@ Chairman R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in a statement by C@@ BS News .
CO@@ E lo@@ oted &quot; Russian Ent@@ school for D@@ oping Sk@@ and@@ al
the global leader of athlet@@ ics , Sebastian Co@@ e , lob@@ es on Thursday what he described as obvious exc@@ use from Russia to a d@@ oping c@@ and@@ al , but he repeated , it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed in sports .
Russia &apos;s athlet@@ ics leader D@@ mit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ ak@@ ht@@ in said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the Athlet@@ ics World Championships that the ban of his country was correct , and that he was determined to combat the d@@ oping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes , who were cut off at competitive gold and silver medals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted for maintaining the ban , which was imposed in November 2015 , after a report of the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency ( WA@@ DA ) has been hin@@ dered to state @-@ sponsored D@@ oping in Russia .
&quot; I thought it was a very open reply , a very hon@@ est presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF president Co@@ e to Rep@@ orters .
&quot; the entire Council and the whole congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has experienced that it has experienced some hot times and will make it possible to ensure that the Federation shall be redesigned . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; CO@@ E said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleased that Russia accept the criteria for its introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very designed day , and I think that progress has been achieved , but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force , that this is not the moment to eng@@ age Russia , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; we must do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation .
the gui@@ ding principle was always wanted to separate the clean athl@@ ete from the corrup@@ ted system , &quot; added
ninet@@ een Russian athletes are competing in the World Athlet@@ ics World Championships starting Friday in London , following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors .
the director of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia had to fulfil some of the criteria for a return setting .
drug tests are still without in@@ adequate and banned coach , he said re@@ porter in London after a talk at the IA@@ AF Council .

doub@@ ts at the UN mission in Mali showed no doubt : the use is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he is also of high importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country where we separated by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Prince Hen@@ rik wants a grave beside his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried next to his wife .
I shared the Royal House on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish king &apos;s wife is buried in the cathedral of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ø@@ r@@ n N@@ ø@@ r@@ ga@@ ard made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for both of them .
the Queen to agree with the decision of her husband , and commanded it to be written in the notification .
where Prince Hen@@ rik would be buried , be still un@@ clear .
but he did not have the intention to be buried in his French country .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a command that he was not happy with his title .
following the throne of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would be king to be king .
he retired in 2016 and also sets the title &quot; prin@@ the@@ ahl . &quot;
since Hen@@ rik did not get the title and function he wanted to see his wife not as equal to his wife - even not after death , L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by , the leader of the Danish royal house .
where the final resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will be finally un@@ clear .
but he did not have the intention to be buried in his French hom@@ eland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he worked in the last 50 years .
the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French noble gender , had learned to know Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London .
at the Th@@ ames he worked in the French Embassy .
during his future wife the sympath@@ izers of the people always had to pl@@ ess , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his almost 50 @-@ year reg@@ ression .
in a auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did .
my Danish was fluctu@@ ating , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk wra@@ ps instead of Stri@@ ck@@ so@@ cks , Citroën instead of Volvo , tennis .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises that I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia tobacco smoke and those who have had a reputation to be the brand of critical intellec@@ tu@@ als , I could not hope to view .
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed .
that was like two mist@@ akes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Weil wants to re @-@ election
CDU and F@@ DP in front of the highest majority in Lower Saxony
defe@@ ating Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) , according to the loss of the red @-@ green government multilingual , will re@@ sign the country &apos;s re@@ country , but he does not want to re@@ tre@@ ad it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because he had taken a parliament on Friday for the dis@@ solution of the parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the surprising view of an Green M@@ EPs from their land fra@@ ction in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a severe crisis .
five months before the official date of the Parliament election , the red @-@ green Coalition in Hanover lost its close @-@ voices majority in parliament to the opposition from CDU and F@@ DP .
the current Green @-@ member El@@ ke T@@ li@@ fe@@ jack@@ ets founded their step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ üm@@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CDU , &quot; she explained on Friday in Hannover .
CDU fra@@ ctional head Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ings@@ ler wants to recommend it to his Group to record them .
thus CDU and F@@ DP had 69 seats at Lower Saxony , SPD and Green 68 seats .
until now , the relationship was revers@@ ed .
the new Parliament will be elected to the 14th of January next year .
Th@@ reads said the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether to rain on this situation without a majority .
Stephan Weil still holds indisp@@ ens@@ able for indisp@@ ens@@ able that the State Parliament decides to resol@@ ve its self @-@ resolution quickly .
the CDU faction is expected to decide on Tuesday through her .
the Constitution also sees the possibility of creating the trust of the prime minister &apos;s ministry and cho@@ oses a successor .
&quot; our Constitution offers several options .
these possibilities have to be thoroughly tested legal , &quot; said Th@@ esis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in quiet@@ ness all the questions are en@@ forced , if legally reasonable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Th@@ ings@@ ler called T@@ west@@ ens step &quot; but something Kur@@ i@@ os . &quot;
the politics of politics stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
she described himself as a trailer of black @-@ green .
the Green required the ab@@ lo@@ ot de@@ pu@@ ties to the return of their country &apos;s convention .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &apos;re assum@@ ing that they received her country @-@ convention , which she has received over the green country list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the regional presi@@ ding met@@ a Janssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Group leader of the Green An@@ ja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we regre@@ t the choice of El@@ ke T@@ li@@ fe@@ jack@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they deliber@@ ately decided to lead not the language in the fra@@ ction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in front of the background , there was no content differences , we cannot perform this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns German Green Party El@@ ke T@@ empl@@ ars for the CDU as a betra@@ y@@ al .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Beh@@ avi@@ or of the former Green M@@ EPs in Lower Saxony is not only tre@@ ason to the elec@@ torate , but also betra@@ y@@ al of Red @-@ Green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Social Democrats &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote on Friday on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he support the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) to re @-@ select the Parliament &apos;s day .
the Australian bank costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ and@@ al that the CDU in Lower Saxony will play this dirty action play and tried to hit the political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
precip@@ it@@ ational CDU fra@@ ction leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ings@@ ler wants to accept his members , El@@ ke T@@ fe@@ jack@@ ets in the CDU .

the CDU was at that time the SPD strongest power , SPD and green , but had a large majority vote of one vote in the Parliament .
Agriculture Minister in the Interview - How do we protect us before tox@@ ins , Mr Schmidt ?
Germany discussed about verb@@ al eggs .
how could the sc@@ and@@ al happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is an interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and response .
Mr. Schmidt , How can the consumer protect me from po@@ is@@ oned eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumer goods and consumers to check the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp pressure .
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the states represent the latest information on the affected eggs .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if after all , what we know , a health haz@@ ard is practically excluded .
now Al@@ di has taken the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the State Minister is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
the food surveillance is the task of the federal states .
nevertheless , my house has immediately shut up immediately and is located in the close exchange of Germany &apos;s strict exchange with the authorities of the countries .
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
the trade has the same as the manufacturers to ensure that the selling products are convenient and health @-@ harmful .
if the resi@@ den@@ ess level of 0.000@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are not convenient .
un@@ loaded eggs can be sold and eaten .
this time does not include the local companies .
are production farms and consumers in the same boat ?
according to the ze@@ able knowledge , the production plant meets no immediate debt .
instead , they must calculate serious damage from service firms with economic damages due to mut@@ in@@ ally illegal practices .
as always there is too little controllers in harvest .
is missing only at the staff or also at the weak jurisdiction ?
there were just the official controls that revealed the process .
however , for truth , however , food and criminal energy can never be impossible to 100 percent .
this is why a consistent en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment of such events and hand@@ ing over to the State attor@@ neys in the cases where offen@@ ders may be important .
I have already made several times that I expect a complete en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment by the responsible authorities .
is the regular alarm control really necessary in food dishes ?
consumer women and consumers have the right to get exclusively safe and convenient foods .
if a non @-@ permitted insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ de in the food industry is used , consumer goods and consumers are un@@ distur@@ bed .
due to the deleted funds , manufacturers , dealers and consumers have come to a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
basically , it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ ds Fi@@ pron@@ il at the attitude of life @-@ medi@@ ating animals is not acceptable and must be terminated immediately .
it must consistently run on all levels and working with high pressure .
I expect from all relevant authorities that the atomic fact is rec@@ alled and appro@@ ach@@ able .
how the financial rules of football on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules that aim to prevent un@@ related issues of the European football matches , N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain will not inter@@ f@@ ere .
any consequences are still come to Paris Saint @-@ Germain from UEFA UEFA , because the leading organization has been monitored by the European game has the power to offer teams of access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
the Financial Fair @-@ Play rules which were launched in 2011 by the UEFA &apos;s life means that PS@@ G has to follow sometimes that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar was financed without big losses .
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million $ ) to get out of its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary which will amount to $ 10 million per year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
PS@@ G can loose the money with security , so N@@ ey@@ mar writes and bring him into a galax@@ y of other stars , in view of the financing of the team by the rich Herr@@ scher@@ sleben family of Qatar .
one may apply a lot of money for the purchase of players , but have to control the more legitim@@ ate sources , which allow them to allow the break @-@ even point in their way to the football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini according to his election to the UEFA president in 2007 .
the former French player believed that Ver@@ one who had lost enormous debt in their quest for success , effectively fr@@ au@@ dul@@ ent and ris@@ ky to ru@@ in@@ ct when banks or owner returned their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P moved from the concentration to the debts of the clubs on the monitoring of their losses .
the change meant that the business model that Roman Ab@@ ram@@ ovi@@ ch originally used in Chelsea - a club with potential bought and then strongly invested in order to build the team and build a global brand - to a har@@ der matter .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P conversion period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can reach a rate of EUR 30 million .
and although Plat@@ ini has fallen from the presi@@ dency in Un@@ gn@@ ade in 2015 , his UEFA successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to make an effort of over@@ sized issues .
&quot; surely , FF@@ P is not dead , and we will intensi@@ fy the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEFA for FF@@ P , compared to The Associated Press in the past week .
although the PS@@ G has paid the Buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a package price , it can distribute the amount to invo@@ icing over the duration of his contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year lease , so that the total revenue was to be paid for the next five years in the amount of EUR 4@@ 4.4 million .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has taken PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is located in the possession of Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which was later lowered to 20 million euros , and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players otherwise normal 25 players .
the UEFA is looking for clubs who could try to over@@ sight their financial view by providing their revenues by companies that are connected to the owners of a clubs .
during a cat@@ aract company the PS@@ G could not exceed the standard market rates , the UEFA wouldn &apos;t be considered legal entity .
exactly this happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of the sponsor@@ ship of the PSA @-@ Qatar @-@ Authority was b@@ lown off .
it was reported that a part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could occur in Qatar on payments of the 2022 World Health Committee .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 challenged that N@@ ey@@ mar World Amb@@ ass@@ adors will be simply to find out a der@@ rich maneu@@ ver for the UEFA European regulatory authorities .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G means that the UEFA will be even atten@@ tive to observe the rules .
the UEFA had no preparatory convers@@ ations with PS@@ G via N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they talked to the condition of an@@ on@@ ym@@ ity with the Associated Press , since they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 has generated sales of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
the accounts for the last fiscal year must still be published .
PS@@ G expects that N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival a blessing for Spon@@ sor@@ ing @-@ Deals , mer@@ chan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot is expected .
the association assumes that sales after the signature will rise by at least 30 per cent .
the Spanish League was clearly ir@@ it@@ ated , one of the best football player to see , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ moon &apos;s way that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial d@@ oping &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the President of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to the last owner of PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Arsenal @-@ Manager Ar@@ sene W@@ enger , whose association is owned by American Sports @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the pre @-@ hold of La League against a State which was financed an association .
&quot; it is the consequence of the owner and this has changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; said W@@ enger on Thursday .
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible .
it is very difficult to respect the Financial Fair@@ play because you can have different ways or have different interests if a country has an so big player to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new sch@@ og@@ gil@@ ding
in the past few years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y Bord @-@ Chocolate has made of fine chocolate for the Swiss .
now the new cooperation is in front of a possible end : the airline has been writing the job .
Swiss spokes@@ person Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ p confirmed on request of the news agency S@@ DA a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; Northern Switzerland &quot; from Friday .
according to the current planning , the airline will conclu@@ de a new contract during the first half of 2018 .
the products would have examined every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y we are very satisfied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some 17 million small red c@@ ashed sl@@ abs of up to 14 grams per year travelled the passengers in front of the landing to the passengers .
over the cost , the Swiss does not want to make any information .
industry accounts estimate the order volume according to &quot; Northwest Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary generates an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs .
but more important is all@@ em@@ al of the advertising effect : it is a pre@@ stige order for a smith shop .
as many applicants there is with the new call , the Swiss does not want to betra@@ y the Swiss .
in question , however , only Swiss manufacturers come .
according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make a renewal of the contract for the spring of 2018 .
for the S@@ DA , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer could not be reached for an opinion .
chocolate bars distributed in Swiss since 2006 on board of its flights .
before the Swiss concluded a contract with Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut plant in cooperation with H@@ ug the chocolate tablets .
the possibility to place the logo , introduced two and a half years ago with the start of collaboration with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline operates with various Swiss chocolate producers .
on long @-@ distance wings the customers of the first class are spo@@ iled by the Con@@ fis@@ ry Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in Business Class Sh@@ og@@ gi of Lin@@ dt and in Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
Swiss Sch@@ og@@ gi of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y also distributed on the short trip , both in Business and Economy Class .

impact on drugs Mafia in the country
the police succeeded in a blow against the Italian Mafia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , in the Black Forest Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Constance , Esslingen and Stuttgart numerous objects searched , as the Public Prosecutor of Konstan@@ z ha@@ sted on Friday .
at the age of 15 , 15 years old and 77 years old were arrested and issued warran@@ ts in arrest warran@@ ts .
in addition , the officials issued large amounts of mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana and co@@ ca@@ ine , qu@@ orum and several hundred thousand euros .
in the same ra@@ ids in Italy two people were arrested .
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects .
the two will therefore have to be delivered to Germany .
in the promotion , Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved .
a total of more than 300 polic@@ emen were employed .
the Mafia , organised by members of the Mafia , was accused of violent crimes , su@@ peri@@ ority murder as well as smo@@ b and ex@@ tor@@ tion .
since summer 2016 , the Public Prosecutor of Konstan@@ z was established against the organised drug tra@@ ff@@ icking in the South German region .
between the so@@ lic@@ es in Konstan@@ z and Palermo , a real exchange and investig@@ ator of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore the big application on Wednesday morning was accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
in particular , the vis@@ or of the investigations were primarily Italian nationals with respect to the Italian Mafia .
a incident on May 27 in hat@@ s , where several shots were fired at the early mor@@ nings early in the morning , is likely to go to the bank account .
pro@@ claim large g@@ aps in the fore@@ igner @-@ register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data of citizens that were not visible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : a report according to the fore@@ igner regi@@ sters are significant short@@ com@@ ings in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the lead to partly engraved failure on asylum procedures .
the Federal Government Commissioner for the refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has given attention to a media report that has been atten@@ tive to large g@@ aps in the country &apos;s foreign register .
defic@@ ien@@ cies in the there registered data could lead for asylum procedures and shi@@ fts . &quot; in an analysis carried out in an analysis created by the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
according to the regi@@ sters , ten million people with foreign nationality are recorded , among them 5.7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data is therefore managed by about 600 foreign authorities in Germany .
because the data has not been maintained enough , the data quality has not been good in parts so far .
in individual cases , data from 1921 were found , &quot; of people who have long been not longer in life , or of citizens , the German citizen has become and in the regi@@ sters actually no longer should appear . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; def@@ ective data can slow@@ down significantly slow@@ ing down , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it to the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the statistics of foreign citizens , this EU citizens were captured , who would not have to travel out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but such false assign@@ ments led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a frag@@ ile debate on the dealing with travel light , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus says in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the Federal Government apparently began to return refugee families with children under 16 @-@ year children , when they travelled from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this came out of an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( B@@ AM@@ F ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue Panel back@@ back@@ ing newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the paper it means that B@@ AM@@ F lead such procedures &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and infants - after Italy since 1st June 2017 through . &quot;
since the end of 2014 , practically no longer was possible , the newspaper in reference to the difficult situation .
after the Dublin agreement , it is responsible for refugees in the EU state to get it first .
if a migran@@ t travels to another EU country , this state can send him back to the immig@@ ration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; write the ministry : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile the capacity of ap@@ ac@@ ity for families with minor children has increased substantially in Italy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy I submitted for the recording and accommodation of family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( E@@ GM@@ R ) hold these supplements .
other EU countries would also send refugees to the public as part of the Dublin Agreement .
the domestic policy of the Lin@@ ks@@ fra@@ ction in the Bundestag , Ul@@ la Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children affected because of the defic@@ ien@@ cies of the Italian asylum system of human Rights and a threat of childhood . &quot;
second best result achieved

the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25 %
the Bank of England is likely to announce that interest rates remain unchanged , after the weak economic growth and the f@@ atten@@ ing of inflation would have sub@@ du@@ ed about an increase .
the Bank of England warned that economic growth &quot; deals will remain , when she maintained interest rates on family income in the middle of a growing pressure .
the Bank &apos;s policy decision @-@ makers ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.25 % , with less members gain a rise in this month , as the weak economic growth has the support for increasing an increase .
in its quarterly annual inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth progn@@ osis for 2017 to 1.7 % , and in 2018 it would rise to 1.6 % and in the fall of 2018 , inflation in autumn is likely to rise to almost 3 % .
but they sign@@ alized that in the next few years , interest rate would be necessary to stream@@ lined the inflation of Bre@@ x@@ it and she said that credit costs may reach more than expected on the financial markets .
the members also agreed to withdraw a part of the mamm@@ oth business package , which was published before a year after the Bre@@ x@@ ite .
it will require time for the financing plan to provide money for banks starting in February , although it is expected that they are expected to provide 15 billion pounds more in the frame of this system - at 115 billion pounds Sterling .
after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC , the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak , as the pressure on the real income of households continues to be charged . &quot;
in addition to the interest rates , it repeated that &quot; a certain stra@@ ction of monetary policy , &quot; for cooling the inflation and a &quot; slightly larger &quot; extent , the markets expect to expect .
the markets currently forecast the first rise in the third quarter of the next year and one another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank has stressed that increases &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradually &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s growth forecast for this and next year are expected to be 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared to the forecast in May .
it has retained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell to these messages opposite the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1,@@ 11 Euro .
the decision on any change comes after the most recent dis@@ appo@@ inting growth figures increase the rising expectations on a interest rate and increased the GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to increase in the third quarter at 0.3 % , although it is slightly recover after the Bank at the end of the year .
the most recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households that will be affected by increasing inflation and mar@@ gin@@ ally cas@@ ings , since the dis@@ appearance is still worse before it gets better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that the monetary policy could not be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dis@@ rup@@ tions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next few years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she added that wages for the end of their three year forecast &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will recover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is attributable to the weak pounds , equivalent to a part of the lower consumer expenditure .
the decision is one year following the lowering of interest rates to 0.25 % in August following the sho@@ cking EU vote that caused the sin@@ king &apos;s sin@@ king .
the Bank estimates that it will take place for four years until this is the prices and the economy completely .
prior to the final decision of the Bank at interest rates , the reputation was increased after an interest rate , because inflation was increased to hard @-@ pressed households , with three political decision @-@ makers in July a rise to 0.5 % .
the inflation decreased in the last month from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % , although the Bank said that this was expected and let them go back in the next few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said that it aims at the ratio to their target of 2 % &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be able to wake up the weak pounds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ br@@ is , director at Co@@ rec@@ o Mort@@ ara Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent decline of the s@@ wap rate , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive , as the len@@ ders would seek to search for shops and end the year in a positive way .
the market is particularly well suited for those who close the existing deal and close the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with toll @-@ free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) to prescri@@ be 10,000 people of controversi@@ al HIV drug .
in September after a fight against the financing of the drug in N@@ HS , patients will receive access to a &quot; transformation &quot; HIV pre@@ ven@@ tional treatment .
N@@ HS England announced that one before sexual intercourse had recorded relief positi@@ vely ( Pr@@ EP ) , which can reduce the risk of infection for high risk patients by around 86 percent , is now supplied by the health service over a first three @-@ year study of estimated 10.000 people .
he declared himself to finance the trial , after the Appeals Court confirmed the judgment of the Supreme Court in the past year , after that the N@@ HS had to pay the powers that the local authorities should finance him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Thursday announced chess news from N@@ HS England boss Simon Stev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; during the National AIDS Trust ( NAT ) that called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decisive moment &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Brigh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be one of the first to allow the notification of people , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced in England in April 2018 .
Pre@@ ex@@ positi@@ onal hydr@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) is a result of HIV preparations taken before having sex in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP significantly reduced the HIV transmission in the rate of infection .
Pr@@ EP before sexual intercourse means that only enough drugs in the body are present in order to prevent HIV infection .
such medicines can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse .
among those who come to the question are gay or bis@@ exual , trans@@ sexual and persons with HIV positive partners , which were not successful successfully .
in clinics , suitable participants are identified to agree to the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who controls a partner whose HIV @-@ status is not known for anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment .
people who are living in England and registered with a hom@@ est@@ ry , can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program will receive a £ 10 million and N@@ HS United Kingdom signed a contract for the delivery of the medic@@ ations in this week after an international competitive price .
the study will evaluate the entire potential of Pr@@ ison by using clinical data , as it is targeted and implemented in a large scale .
Stev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention is supposed to complement and over@@ take care and over@@ take care of HIV increasingly successful efforts .
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of continuing progress with regard to one of the biggest health challenges of humanity . &quot;
Deb@@ orah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National AIDS Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV .
Pr@@ EP , if specifically tail@@ ored to needs and end@@ anger@@ ed people , the possibility to change the English HIV pan@@ demic .
in September , people with high HIV risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument which is really individually controlled , and is not subject to a negoti@@ ation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many lives .
we welcome our announcement . &quot;
Ian Green , Chairman of the Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority must now lie that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left .
now , since the Pr@@ EP @-@ Test@@ medicine has been built , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot;
Sharon Hod@@ g@@ son , Sh@@ adows @-@ Health Minister , said : &quot; the beginning of the Pr@@ EP process is welcome to months , delay and oblig@@ atory implementation by the government .
the evidence shows how trans@@ forming these drug as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can termin@@ ate the transfer of this life @-@ change infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to the understanding of the advantages of Pr@@ EP .
now it is important that this study is as fast as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV ( so that they will contribute to it that we will come closer to the dis@@ sem@@ ination of HIV in society .
living life : mezzanine and clever designers tricks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court home to a generous home
Jo@@ anne L@@ eig@@ h , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , resi@@ zed in 2014 from a large house in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court Apartment .
it is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed their bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before I was living in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger space , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I searched for something that was comparable to my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have made myself in love and made an offer on that day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first tour the 1,000 square foot has been completely overhau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room property with a fl@@ aw@@ ed layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - wanted to add the pan box and a mezzanine to optimally use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted to have high ceilings , great windows , plenty of light .
that was my request , &quot; says she .
for this purpose she assigned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Notting Hill , which was 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to life for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms over@@ place , so the architectural challenge was able to create a mezzanine in which one could stand .
er@@ fan had to be creative thinking to solve the for@@ warding .
&quot; the steel plant is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so arranged that they had stack@@ ed together on each other without that we had to g@@ aps . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it didn &apos;t just go to build a simple platform , but the steel set it for the position above or below the right height . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement made it possible to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional Drama .
for the mezzanine you can see a classic copper light windows of the g@@ rou@@ vi@@ us over the gl@@ am@@ ous living area .
mir@@ ro@@ red gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style to the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
on both ends , a short corridor is mir@@ ro@@ red to leave it longer .
in the kitchen , the mirror feels like a window in another room .
at the entrance we offer room for all the best corner and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a smooth prey , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .
folding kitchens are not new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little engineering art went in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the fan of the steel reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF @-@ door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s very important so that if you push the door high , it is very easy to lead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne was able to gain extra 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the base area - or as your property is estimated , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ary form a real estate bro@@ ker will enter and perform a calculation based on the ground size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they made it to enlarge the floor space and use high @-@ quality materials that make the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things you touch and therefore help to create a emotional li@@ aison in a home &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t love yourself into the electric sockets in walls .
these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be converted by a good design and increased square meters of slightly default in something quite amazing .
in fact , such as Jo@@ anne , you might decide to leave this not .
we fight for a 500 million US dollars in real estate imperi@@ alist
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a con@@ front@@ ation because of one of the greatest real estate imper@@ ies Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as , worth over $ 500 million .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and Develop@@ ers Colin De Lut@@ is lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . this has brought him to the Supreme Court to clari@@ fy how to become ownership and their business assets .
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp con@@ front@@ ation about the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers had 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars , accumulated since the 1973 family bought a business in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
the West@@ co Je@@ ans family founded and grew up with a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
this property has been invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lut@@ is now includes offices in the city center , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the suburbs .
after an agreement with her de@@ ceased father , Colin - was described by Paul as &quot; chief operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lut@@ is family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul approximately one @-@ third .
a place of jurisdiction says that Colin has owned property valued at CHF 316 million and Paul valued at $ 176 million .
the distribution of real estate and cash has been shown for Paul as a sample point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the requested by Colin made by Colin made him the left which I kept for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in a first aff@@ id@@ av@@ it in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed medi@@ ations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .
the brothers also strug@@ gling with the control of the existing business - including Colin , as Paul claims to have made him excluded .
Colin argu@@ ed that this is not true , but has Paul to manage some poss@@ essions in competent .
in an early aff@@ id@@ av@@ it that was submitted by Colin , he says he hope to stri@@ ve the stri@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian heritage says that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost gets in the case , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports from companies including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , among them Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both sides of the law firm .
Mrs. De Lut@@ is and her late husband Luigi were Italian immig@@ rants , operated with milk bars and delic@@ acy shops in the late 1950 &apos;s and bought a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property , in Colin made the first Je@@ ans@@ und family in Colin .
Colin says that he began to have West@@ co as he was &quot; in my last years of high school , when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lut@@ is says that she died , and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hop@@ ed to add property to their sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi has often said to me that he never wanted to take the brothers before the court , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are not more part of the De Lut@@ is Group group . Colin claims that Mark were paid at the leaving of the company 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars .
both Luke and Mark are , so Paul &quot; said about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
Colin made himself very un@@ expect@@ edly , although he was a former AF@@ L Board member , and following a biography in 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire of the best friend of the television stars .
Fair@@ fax Media took us with Colin and Paul De Lut@@ is and their lawyers in contact with us .
only Colin answered by SMS to say &quot; I don &apos;t really say much , &quot; because the case before the courts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to compl@@ ain me and asked our family name by the courts &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tries to fulfil the demands of his brother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father could not be pleased that Paul and I would end in our current battle &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is still waiting for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our matter will be solved in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Colin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s new Chief of Staff is planning to restri@@ ct media de@@ men@@ tia to the President .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps John F. Kelly can do it really .
if yes , he will be the first .
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO claims that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to restri@@ ct the information flow to President tr@@ ump - including the reports of the news media - in hope , chief of a more uniform course .
here is a piece of Rep@@ orter Jos@@ h Daw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , in his first working day with senior employees , he introduced a main problem in President Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps White House which he rep@@ airing : bad information that come into the hands of the President .
Kelly said the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in correspondence - because the President would meet better decisions , if he would receive good information . &quot;
wa@@ ist diagnostic power makes sense but others tries to count tr@@ ump by controlling its media facilities .
President Tr@@ um@@ ps has been back for decades - and now , where he is at the White House , his TV advertising is still strong .
&quot; if candidate tr@@ ump was off@@ ended due to un@@ fair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of places that were convinced , &quot; said the former elec@@ toral consultant Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February against PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO .
Polit@@ ic@@ os Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key to keep Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter custom under control , according to six former coun@@ sel@@ ing officers to ensure that his personal media consumption involves a constant praise . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter is ever &quot; under control , &quot; is ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous .
perhaps this campaigns realize something , what we don &apos;t know that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twe@@ ets could not contain more combust@@ ible numbers without their inter@@ ventions .
we will never know something about the twe@@ ets that will not broadcast tr@@ ump .
if his employees create him some times , trouble from him , then their effort was worth it .
but no one has to prevent it consistently calls for tr@@ ump contro@@ vers@@ es .
a part of the problem exists that people together in a white house , that places out of competing parties , will always try to present their own agenda , which may encourage their views from the world .
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO - Est@@ abl@@ ished with this history - reported on the pre@@ ference for strategic reasons to investigate strategic reasons .
this was an example that was described by re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tr@@ ump officials predi@@ ct that Tr@@ ump can react to negative press classes , especially those with damage le@@ aks , and that he may find out how they come out .
exactly this happened at the end of February , when someone claims to be a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet Pro@@ v@@ ok@@ at@@ eur Charles C. Johnson who accused the source of Deputy Prime Minister K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a cluster to be &quot; at the White House .
although Johnson was ex@@ iled permanently on Twitter due to lack of evidence , or that he sold no concrete evidence in the past , or that he has given false alleg@@ ations in the past .
Tr@@ ump reading the article and began to ask collabor@@ ating on Wal@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; gold @-@ maker added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did this work ?
Kelly tried three months later to do the same .
perhaps he will prove itself as an effective Manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and its advis@@ ors still stri@@ ve to influence .
these distinctive factors make the cell@@ ars &apos;s mission very difficult .
master@@ y crimin@@ als get mail from Europ@@ ol
since the address is unknown , the aid of the population will be praying and hop@@ ed .
the police sent over Europe in this summer ( virtual ) postcards to the escape of dangerous crimin@@ als .
since the addresses of the requested heavy cr@@ ush@@ ers are not known to be known , references from the population will be hop@@ ing and pray .
Europ@@ ol reported on Friday from the promotion which follows the &quot; EU Most W@@ an@@ ted &quot; Advent calendar from winter .
the experiences had shown that many vol@@ at@@ ile on holiday operations hide it from Europ@@ ol .
there are 21 postcards collected from 21 EU countries for requested crimin@@ als .
since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ er has been available , and more than 2.5 million times has been viewed .
36 of the online games have been arrested so far , at least eleven of them due to the publication on the website .
travelers negoti@@ ate over a tr@@ ench and return to the &apos; million@@ aire @-@ series &apos;
some of the we@@ al@@ thi@@ est house owner of West Mid@@ lands have been tra@@ ded again with a number of spontan@@ eous trav@@ ellers , which have tra@@ ded one from the commune of drawn tom@@ bs in order to claim a field before their houses .
the trav@@ ellers have par@@ ked their 20 caravans on a field outside a we@@ al@@ thy road of Soli@@ m , called the &quot; Milli@@ on@@ är@@ s series . &quot;
they have been brought to horses , babies and a Army of transports , after they were exp@@ elled only in May without having been shot down by the Council of excav@@ ated tr@@ ench to prevent their accidents .
the tak@@ eover group found a gap in the defence systems and pressed their vehicles by a passage that remained un@@ ob@@ stru@@ cted in order to find a path .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the inhabitants of Soli@@ m have pushed the Council of Soli@@ m , who said it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; easy to deal with the problem &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an anonymous residents said : &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were sent from Bentley He@@ ath where they were thrown into the passages .
the Council must be forced to implement in deed when dealing with the problem was us@@ eless .
the trav@@ ellers were moved there in May , and now returned to date .
more arrived yesterday evening , probably today more . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham know how to make long sub@@ instructions to protect their park . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I live at Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to pay my municipal tax if the Council cannot stop that . &quot;
a people who wanted not to be called , said : &quot; it is ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , we have just seen the last round of this trip , just to be spo@@ iled by another round .
the numbers have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the park area . &quot;
a spokes@@ person on the Council of Soli@@ m said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the land beyond the stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to continue it as quickly as possible .
in order to support our Be@@ aver collection , it is very important that as possible many people in order to report an anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police , when they call 101 .
this helps to create a picture of the situation where we must examine the Court when we present our case . &quot;
from Birken@@ hof becomes Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Birken@@ hof , Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is opened .
the house at the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be reopened on 1st March next year .
they are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the Hotel Birken@@ hof over the former Ambiente Company mbH , April 13 , 2014 , some 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and proceeds through the tourist tax .
in the autumn of 2014 , in view of the dramatic increasing numbers of refugees who came into the district , the hotel building is offered as a collective accommodation , which minist@@ ered to the controversi@@ al discussion .
the city prevented the placing of asylum seek@@ ers through the preparation of a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not disp@@ uted at the time at that time .
however , in front of the historic town of lor@@ ries Julian Oss@@ wald did def@@ ending the hotel site and spoke about seriously interested parties in the house .
he should keep right .
the Group Lu@@ isen@@ yi with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ians had acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three @-@ star plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ians and one in Bad Man@@ al@@ b .
you are called Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the former Hotel Birken@@ hof has already been standing up for a long period of building blocks before the entrance , and when you enter the house , it is clear how extensive renov@@ ations will be carried out .
the floors were torn out , ceilings to the part , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
until March there is still much to do .
&quot; it is actually a lovely hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything is supposed to be renewed in the Black Forest .
the rooms are equipped with large sho@@ wering showers , the input range will be redesigned and the new window will be installed .
everything would be very close to &quot; Beautiful far &quot; how Thomas Sch@@ erer is ex@@ presses .
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewelry . &quot;
the swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room are part of the equipment .
it would not be located at the high level of hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on a higher city level , emphas@@ ises Sch@@ erer .
the forest hotel Lu@@ ise , with its approximately 60 rooms , explains its width .
individual tourists , groups or business@@ men should feel at home at the hotel .
talks with O@@ B Julian Oss@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael K@@ rau@@ se have already led , so sh@@ erer .
the performances of the city are covered with those of the Hotel Group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
after the amount of investment is asked , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to consoli@@ date .
less than a million euros , he calcul@@ ates .
the external plants will also be brought to front , which is already visible .
in a courtyard , a large terrace , which is publicly accessible from the restaurant , which is publicly accessible .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia Aff@@ air : U.S. Special Representative uses Grand Jury
in Russia &apos;s aff@@ air to US President Donald Tr@@ ump , a so @-@ called Grand Jury was appointed by US President Donald Tr@@ ump .
in the past few weeks , the committee started working on appeal , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; on appeal .
the paper evalu@@ ates the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has widened its investigations and intensi@@ fied .
CN@@ N reported , there is already the first pre@@ inv@@ itations of the committee in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps el@@ dest son and a Russian attor@@ ney .
us secret services accused the Kre@@ m@@ lin in order to have targeted specifically in the presidential campaign in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller is examined whether they spoke between Tr@@ um@@ ps elec@@ toral team and Moscow .
in the focus of the investigations , there are several men standing in election campaign as a consultant of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
according to reports , Mu@@ eller also took more and more tr@@ um@@ ps private and business environment among the micro@@ scope .
the Washington Post , &quot; wrote some weeks ago that the special st@@ em@@ ler Tr@@ ump personally placed in the centre and taught the alleg@@ ation whether the President may hin@@ der justice in the course of the aff@@ air .
the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to verify that this pro@@ ofs may prove and decide whether the indictment should be imposed .
in addition , Grand jur@@ ys are also called an@@ cl@@ ed .
mostly they will be switched on when it is bigger and controversi@@ al cases .
the procedure will always be closed behind closed doors .
in addition , the board can also be switched on by the Public Prosecutor to re@@ charge persons under oath .
according to the CN@@ N channels , pre @-@ inv@@ itations were exhibited , which turned to meet the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian attor@@ ney .
people who were involved in the meeting were invited to a statement , named it in the report .
you should also prepare documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. there were also Tr@@ um@@ ps consultants and son @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner as well as his destruction leader Paul Man@@ a@@ fort with the conversation .
right @-@ wing remarks on Thursday evening in the U.S. television that the entry show that Mu@@ eller is not in@@ timi@@ dated in his work , and that it should be necessary , acting quickly .
however , it must not be hot , that the Grand Jury is switched on at the end to decide on the collection of an accus@@ ation .
nevertheless , the composition of the committee was the start of a new phase in the research and a new reason for the concern for President Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of the new revelation , the President on Thursday evening took an address in West Virginia to present Russia &apos;s aff@@ air as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; Russia &apos;s history is a complete invention , &quot; said Tr@@ ump .
the theme of the Democrats give the Democrats a way to feel good , &quot; because they have nothing else to talk about which they can talk . &quot;
his special advis@@ er T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in a position he knows nothing from the composition of a Grand Jury .
but this work also usually work in case , he stressed .
the White House advoc@@ ates all measures to accelerated the work of the special thing on &quot; f@@ aire &quot; mode .
the former FB@@ I chief Apostle James Com@@ ey said that it was not determined against the President .
I have no reason to accept that something has changed in this statement .
but Mu@@ eller was only used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey fired .
because of these re@@ ties , we have become dro@@ s@@ led to Tr@@ ump , he who want to hin@@ der justice .
com@@ ey said in June before a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump gave him a setting of investigations against the then national security consultant Michael Fl@@ ynn .
the president stands under great pressure because of the investigation .
after representation of U.S. media , the White House was gathered against the Special Representative and his employees .
that dissolved spec@@ ulations about whether Tr@@ ump mu@@ eller are dischar@@ ged .
unlike in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate @-@ Aff@@ air , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate @-@ Aff@@ aires who later returned to Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller may be hired as a position in which he could be fired at the in@@ firm@@ ament of the President of the Ministry of Justice .
several trans@@ formers of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic Sen@@ ators introduced a decision on Thursday , after which the Special Representative could not be released more so easy .
Antar@@ c@@ tica : gigantic Eis@@ berg drives in Antar@@ c@@ tica
in the western Arctic is a gigantic Iron berg from the barely seven @-@ fold @-@ size Berlin@@ s from Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is dissolved .
the Alfred Weg@@ ener Alfred Weg@@ ener Institute for Polar and Maritime Research held on Wednesday .
the stretch over a trillion tonnes of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometres of Kol@@ oss shortly after the North and will probably take two , three years until it was melted .
it has a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometers of one of the largest iron people who have registered in the last three decades .
a danger for people doesn &apos;t go out from him .
in what extent of climate change played a role in the demol@@ ition of the ice , is un@@ clear according to research data .
however , since approximately 30 years there is a series of unusual coll@@ ings in the region , the U.S. Research Centre for snow and ice ( NS@@ IDC ) writes in a fact .
according to many researchers , that can be joined together with global warming .
the broken Kol@@ oss had so far been a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is .
Sh@@ el@@ fe@@ is floating on the sea and is fed by big gl@@ ac@@ iers .
it is always growing on the sea and breaks off regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is located south of South America almost at the top of the ant@@ ar@@ ctic Peninsula .
north of this scra@@ per was the balance of w@@ ax@@ ing and breaks up some years ago .
a complete ch@@ el@@ is to fall there , writes A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
it dis@@ agree that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is in danger , because the front edge have never been withdrawn so far as currently .
Moreover , the iron plate can be cut below , and can be broken up in case of a key station .
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is and Eis@@ berg is elevated above sea level , as they swim on the water and pushed the ice as much water as it desc@@ ends after the melt .
however , the loss of the che@@ er leads to the gl@@ ac@@ iers directly to the sea and to flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase the sea level , but only in a low degree , the British research project writes to observation of Antar@@ c@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI data , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is the fourth biggest arch@@ e@@ fe@@ is of Antar@@ c@@ tica with almost 50 000 square kilometres .
at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 metres thick , on the front edge of the open sea about 200 meters .
there it regularly breaks off .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even though it is a natural bow , and no direct link to climate change is aware , the ice plate comes into a end@@ anger@@ ed position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that is the most important retreat since the beginning of records , &quot; he confirmed also .
among scientists are controversi@@ al whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is now grow back or long , and possibly together , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
even if this researcher do not lead the demol@@ ition of this gigantic iron gs not to change climate change , they are very many ice h@@ unters of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula in recent decades .
this long clock@@ face of Antar@@ c@@ tica extends towards South America .
according to data from the research program British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the increase in temperature was contributed to the decline .
Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have been war@@ med up by around three degrees in the past 50 years , in which the temperature at the fastest sti@@ ff .
CDU wants ke@@ epers at the staff
because it is more difficult to occupy any more difficult places , for the CDU , out of the employer to get more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break the Kre@@ ist@@ ag has an@@ gled 41 new jobs in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and civil servants have been working for the county office in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 trainees have their first working day behind him .
the teachers at the circle are obviously very desired .
some 620 applications were expected to be expected in this year .
nevertheless , the circuit is still missing personnel to handle the increased requirements and tasks .
at the moment , there are currently 50 vac@@ an@@ cies in the district of M@@ ett@@ mann .
we are looking for doctors and engineers and forces of general administration .
the CDU would like to take place in the Kre@@ ist@@ ag together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG on the initiative and to compete in the administration of the au@@ ster@@ ity in administration .
after the wish of parties , the management should work a concept for personal@@ ized and personal development . &quot;
the aim is to cover not only short @-@ term conditions of skilled workers , but future oriented applicants .
the overall concept should be orient@@ ated inside and exter@@ n@@ ally , concrete measures for trans@@ verse beginners and include an apprentic@@ eship offensive , demand CDU , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that list@@ ens to a good approach already after a good approach .
because the circle did it do with personal problems you did not know it earlier so .
other towns are good public officials and employees offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the address is from a real &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of public employer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this purpose , a high number of employees , the disease , or retirement age from the service is ex@@ crete .
thus , the highest time for action should not be still un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Pe@@ oples , president of the CDU , will continue its party with its party .
he had long been in the Kre@@ ist@@ ag for a f@@ ist thick surprise when he presented the staff in question , and the rest of the parties had flour@@ ished .
nations would like to be reviewed all possibilities that make a withdrawal from the municipal workers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we come here not briefly to a satis@@ fying solution , the county management should be growing with the unions - perhaps even in cooperation with the cir@@ cl@@ ing towns - one house rate , &quot; so people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to pay the CDU , employees and officials would be better to pay when the public service is planned for public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently mandatory , enh@@ ancements , or more money , if one changes into a higher level , orient@@ ated at vocational years .
but the tasks of the circle has grown increasingly during the past few years .
only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stit@@ utes protection law .
not least by the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ Director Martin Richter has a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy tigh@@ tened the tone to NGO &apos;s migran@@ t li@@ fel@@ lows
Italy , NGOs who use li@@ fel@@ boats for migrants in the Mediterranean Sea , warned that they are not allowed to continue their operations in new rules of operations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs cover no new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can work on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Interior Minister Marco Min@@ n@@ iti said in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ nit@@ is warning came a day after the Italian authorities had seized a ship of the German aid organisation &apos; Youth R@@ ettet &apos; , because their team had worked effectively with human tra@@ ders in a way that facilit@@ ated the illegal immig@@ ration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation since a year , refused to express the Italian national administrator Amb@@ ro@@ gio Cart@@ osi@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , the salvation of human life is our top priority . so we &apos;re sorry that we can not operate in the search and rescue zone in the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in an opinion about social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can show all the alleg@@ ations that are currently being raised , after which we collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had supervised the boat from &apos; Youth R@@ ettet &apos; , who has been monitoring the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a since October .
it is thought that his crew aboard infl@@ atable @-@ migrants will be delivered to them directly by human hands , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can take off , so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting was supposed to take place only 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast , according to the Ak@@ te des Prosecutor , which was published by Italian media .
the crew is suspected to en@@ rol themselves about the authority of the Italian coast , the li@@ fe@@ jacket in the zone of humanitarian grounds , and not from any other mot@@ ives .
under the code of conduct , boats must have aboard the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , an Italian police officers who over@@ sees their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have been involved , so far have been declared to hold the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules should be un@@ necessarily , but acceptable , since they no &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; significant changes or disability &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ate Organisation for Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
Min@@ n@@ iti said in the meantime , that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy began to decline in the last weeks that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and the cooperation with local citizens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he gave plans for further talks with Libyan citizens about economic development initiatives and with C@@ ad , Niger and Mali about measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe .
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
nine W@@ eil@@ er@@ mer B@@ iker , the &quot; Berliner House &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ enheim in the northern Palat@@ inate in order to enjoy four days of Tri@@ als and sights .
three fixed guides stood at your disposal .
the accommodation at Wach@@ en@@ heimer Tal proved to be a good starting point for tours .
Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ o von Wach@@ enheim was a welcome extra .
the first tour took place at hot summer temperatures along the vines to Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
there followed view points , partly on towers , from which one could look far beyond the Pf@@ äl@@ zer forest and the pre@@ stige levels .
in between there was a longer asc@@ ents again for the long triumph@@ s .
on the second day it went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim for the Sal@@ ine and the Volks@@ fest Wur@@ st@@ market .

after 173 kilometres and almost 4500 meters of altitude , the group had learned the Pf@@ äl@@ zer forest from its best side - sporty and cultural .
console instead of lawn - Bundesliga upgrade for E @-@ Sport
will the sport @-@ stars future sitting in front of computer games , instead of changing the wind and weather in the stadium ?
fact : E @-@ Sports has long since become a serious industry , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - great stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high ages .
these have also recognized the first federal states that increasingly eng@@ age in this area .
beginning of 2015 , the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later followed by the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded a E @-@ Sports Department and two professionals for the computer games FIFA 17 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to in@@ spire a new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the Managing Board of Jochen R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is safe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a few clubs on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next weekend , the soccer world association FIFA organizes the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; to compete in the Gam@@ er of various Clubs .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or PS@@ V Eindhoven qualified .
Robin D@@ utt sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen has now become a agency for virtual football players .
&quot; the real football , particularly with the 14 @-@ 30 @-@ year @-@ old , insi@@ sted that the young people are still going into the stadium , &quot; says the 52 year old .
and : the temp@@ ting tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian , to conquer .
with prominent E @-@ sport@@ s@@ men under contract , one could be present on these markets as only once a year to send the federal budget to Asia .
why is it exactly ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; when E @-@ Sport are computer games like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or transl@@ ate the soccer simulation to the competition on competition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
long , as in the normal sport , we have established themselves to compete against each other in the normal sport .
and with the Asi@@ ans 2022 E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program .
but is it all about a proper sport ?
for many , the performance is safe for the common requirements .
In@@ go F@@ Ro@@ ig also has dealt a long time with the question .
for the professor at the German Sports College in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport , because he is a competent and many biological and physical reactions show that you can also find increased heart rate , stress re@@ actions , hor@@ m@@ onal changes .
in addition , cogn@@ itive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast reaction capability .
professional gam@@ ers should not only exercise on the console but also exercise their bodies and pay attention to the diet .
&quot; the f@@ itte Player is a good player . &quot;
f@@ rob@@ bers also sees problems : &quot; d@@ oping is always more a theme . &quot;
controls are difficult through online games , and in the scene missing the structures of classical sports .
scientists raises the high integ@@ rative effect of the E @-@ Sports .
players are internationally active , this is like a big global family , there is no intercultural shirts .
a study of corporate consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Inter@@ Active Entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) has a rapid growth ahead of the E @-@ Sport .
in 2016 there were 50 million euros in Germany , mainly on advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments .
in three years , sales should be at 130 million .
against the nearly 2.4 billion euros of the football league , this is a little bit .
however , the E @-@ Sports is not far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice @-@ hockey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte Consult@@ ant .
International are already many countries already .
large markets are Asia and the USA where explosion @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez is participating in the US Team N@@ RG e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton K@@ ut@@ cher is investing in the e@@ Sport @-@ bet@@ ting party Uni@@ kr@@ n .
a lot in Europe also does .
in a Norwegian school , E @-@ Sports was introduced as a class@@ room , says F@@ Ro@@ unders .
in the Netherlands and France , the football @-@ first league clubs according to D@@ utt is obliged to establish a E @-@ Sports Department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European comparison Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ f@@ B officers of R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only in nost@@ al@@ gia , and the old times are clari@@ fied , no more than enough .
it is therefore to keep the tradition of the association , but the company was set up at the same time in the modern market .

Michelle Carter because of the lyrics , the Conrad Roy was sentenced to suicide .
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encour@@ ages her friend through texts and calls for suicide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their convic@@ tion behind g@@ ap@@ ns and five years were exposed to par@@ ole .
Carter was sentenced in June for the cas@@ ual murder of Conrad Roy who took life on 13 July 2014 .
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is un@@ comfortable .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter allowed to stay free until the vocation .
she had been con@@ fron@@ ted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but their legal representatives argu@@ ed that both she had suffered by a psych@@ ic illness .
in red tro@@ users and a cream coloured bl@@ ouse , Carter , with tears in the eyes , with folded hands , and down the eyes , was found guilty .
&quot; their actions have been killed Conrad Roy , &quot; the Prosecutor &apos;s lawyer said .
&quot; she finished his life to make her own better .
she has no responsibility , &quot; she said .
&quot; she has no Reu@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ters At@@ tor@@ ney said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; awesome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which they completely regre@@ t@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said he did not show that her &quot; age or maturity or even their spiritual disease have a significant effect on their actions . &quot;
an attor@@ ney read a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy who said that there is no one day in whom I did not feel the loss of my beloved son .
I want that he is proud of me and how I am proud to go with everything . I try , despite all my pain we will bear for ever , for his sisters , it is in it .
Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that they will be prosec@@ uted by the knowledge &quot; that she would never participate in the wedding of her brother or would be a a@@ unt for his children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not more to have this only person with which I was together since my birth every day , is a pain I will always keep for the rest of my life &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent since there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime that require another to commit suicide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in 2014 by a carbon mon@@ oxide oning in a vehicle .
the case referred to national attention , after mapping the text message , that she encouraged him to stop his life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hanging on , spring from a building , first of yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said in several news , which she had sent them in two weeks before his death , while he was with his family in vacation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the sight of his suicide she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must do it , Conrad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ thing that you must do to enter into the generator , and you will be freely and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter sought the death of Roy and ordered that it should benefit through any press from the case .
the case is shared by the legal opinion .
to the few who def@@ ending Carter , Am@@ anda Knox who was sentenced to Italy in 2007 because of murder of her British co @-@ residents in Italy before it was acquitted two years ago .
Ms. Knox , 30 years old , published a comment : &quot; Michelle Carter earns his compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua K@@ imm@@ i : learn from the new mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua was running as captain in the Audi Cup as captain , no co@@ incidence .
the FC Bayern featured a big season with the Con@@ clu@@ ded Cup winner for a great season - Extra motivation would not go there .
something was there different on his place in the cabin , which saw Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich immediately , even when the extra piece is very , very small .
but because far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp Lah@@ m and also no Manuel New was to be seen , he was able to put it on the arm .
&quot; the trainer didn &apos;t announced it , &quot; told the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ fed Cup &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; winner after his first employment as a Bavaria captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
good , it would have been better to run than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign of the coach could also be determined .
not the eight years of older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al was chosen from youth musicians , de@@ but@@ ants , and just chosen from the holiday , existing C @-@ El@@ f as a game leader but he has chosen .
sugar is distributed to those who want to be much , they want to hold at La@@ une .
so who has been chosen to get the inheritance of Lah@@ m , can only use a small extra motivation only well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ imm@@ ich confirmed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what you want to do as a player : responsibility &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old served as a mini @-@ Lah@@ m over the field .
right behind , that is now his position , the white Bin@@ d on the arm did its rest .
and at all , K@@ imm@@ ich took part in this initial information such as the one who can take the ru@@ der at the best in hand .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the tro@@ upe .
he had the view to all , while many others were busy with themselves .
in order to play Vid@@ al , that his missing fitness to play ( folded hardly ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches , on the devil get out on the achievements of the Asia Pacific voyage ( folded only partly ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as sweet@@ le therefore failed to fall up in their first appearance in the Bayern @-@ Tri@@ h@@ kot .
this was really good .
Sü@@ le ran beside K@@ imm@@ ich , Rud@@ y before the f@@ le , both ag@@ ated so@@ vereign .
the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli @-@ storm was often hard , in addition , Sü@@ ver tried himself up a few times a few times .
his colleague Rud@@ y gave up that the result was &quot; not so , as we have hop@@ ed for us . &quot;
but he showed a regular performance at the debut .
game loss , change : &quot; for this style , I was also brought . &quot;
as usual , this Bavaria world is still for the new length , one looked at the game to the game .
Rud@@ y for example was not one or two , but determines six or seven interviews .
K@@ imm@@ i passed after a few cr@@ ack@@ y statements in the back of his new players .
there he heard of Sü@@ le a interesting proposition : &quot; what &apos;s going on here I noticed now .
you simply have to win any game in Bavaria . &quot;
after all this he must not bring the new one more .

Audi is supposed to alter 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - auto manufacturer con@@ fron@@ ts itself with a counter @-@ reaction .
one day before the announcement of Audi said BMW that it would offer to update the software in more than 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
the BMW president said , the company is the opinion that &quot; there are intelligent options as driving restrictions , &quot; and thus moved to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based on diesel vehicles or restri@@ cting diesel vehicles .
Daimler announced that there were three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the sub@@ missions as a recall .
European autom@@ akers strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support the rules of carbon dioxide emissions .
but nitrogen oxi@@ des , which em@@ it diesel engines are considered car@@ cin@@ ogenic and may cause as@@ thma .
the cost of cars to install plants for neutr@@ alisation of diesel vehicles em@@ itted from diesel vehicles , too , also making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of igno@@ red the mighty car companies and signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the errors of so @-@ called amor@@ ti@@ zation devices that could regul@@ ate emissions when a car has been tested but under normal driving conditions .
several employees of Volkswagen were indicted in the United States , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of Ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics was arrested in Germany &apos;s engine development in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni Pam@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be placed in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi had referred to Volkswagen in German criminal investig@@ ations@@ in Volkswagen , following the authorities of Audi , to have a system installed in order to resol@@ ve the emissions requirements in Europe , and has been on request that focused on the United States .
the inclusion of Audi into the study could seriously bel@@ lows Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes over propor@@ tionally to the profit of Volkswagen .

&quot; the most happy day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said once .
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris succeeded in breakthrough at the end of the 60 &apos;s breakthrough : with the publication of his Cart@@ o@@ ons in Paris Match , and then in the &quot; star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .

Lav@@ en@@ del threatened in Provence from climate change

the lav@@ ender is remin@@ ded of d@@ rought for d@@ rought and caused by the ill@@ nesses of the in@@ crimin@@ ating insec@@ ts , leading scientists and farmers who try to find solutions , great head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agricultural research institute CR@@ I@@ EP@@ P@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; the lav@@ ender in Provence is effective , because the plant has been exposed to climate change impacts over the past few years , which had much less rain in the spring and much more .
this has impact on the lif@@ esp@@ an of lav@@ ender .
there is also a little Z@@ ik@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its d@@ warf @-@ mates , and with very dry weather there is very many of them . &quot;
and it &apos;s a lot on the game .

Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of very long vegetable intake with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , UN@@ TER@@ EN@@ TW@@ IC@@ K@@ EL@@ TE and either missing or weak@@ ened .
so we have less parts with essential oil . &quot;
solutions that are considered considered include a better water distribution and the slow@@ down of evap@@ oration from the ground , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective blend of clay and water and the development of varieties that are hard @-@ resistant .

the Ass@@ assin@@ ation of a journalist under@@ scores the growing threat in Mexico
the employees of Weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ce meet in Wedn@@ esdays to check out their plans for the coverage of the youngest chaos in the state of Sin@@ al@@ oa through the organized crime , corrupt civil servants and un@@ ce@@ able drug wars .
but in that day , in the shadow of her own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
it was told them that it is important to change their rout@@ ines .
two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what you feel safe : they are to take their children with the office , which were the aim of an attack with granite , or to leave them at home in 2009 .
safety experts have written three words to a table on the front of the room : opponent , neutr@@ als , allies .
please ask the re@@ porter , name for any column - no proof is necessary , perc@@ eptions and abdom@@ inal properties .
there are drug g@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected to stand on the base list of the government or the cart@@ els , a catalog of Cri@@ me , which make the chaos of Mexico .
there is no break from the violence , and during all the country the cor@@ p@@ ses are frequent , and more journalists took office : at least 25 , since then president En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto opened his office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 have been on attacks and thre@@ ats under Bundes@@ protection and until now there were at least seven dead in seven countries .
among the latter is their editors and their inspiration of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , the co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; the greatest mist@@ akes is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs .
his lack is found deep , although its presence is present - a large photo by Val@@ dez that shows his middle @-@ finger with the word &quot; Justice &apos; , depends on the facade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce building . two re@@ por@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear T @-@ shirts that show its sm@@ iling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop will take place less than two months after his death , and re@@ por@@ ters discuss their shared topics , trau@@ ma , her night@@ mar@@ es , ins@@ om@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although it was established in 2010 , a son@@ g@@ ator has been created in order to edit the cases of journalists , according to the Committee for the Protection of journalists , only two criminal proceedings .
as with the most thousands of Mor@@ den , who are linked each year with drug tra@@ ff@@ icking and organic crimes , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are only taken in court .
with Ri@@ odo@@ ce they still exist to treat the violence of Sin@@ al@@ oa , although they are unnecessary , and although the terrain is still missing .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting on the discussion of safety is little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it is very stup@@ id to spend my time in this workshop , &quot; says he .
&quot; as long as we do not know why we know all . &quot;
on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce at the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was forced by two men . he was forced into him from his car and was supp@@ ressed about 12 times , probably because of the name of the newspaper - the &quot; 12th river . &quot;
the Sag@@ itt@@ arius was gone away in his car and damaged it near .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown @-@ up children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the topic Val@@ dez there are virtually nothing worth silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ mans arrest in January and extra@@ dition in the United States in January , Sin@@ al@@ oa became one of the bloody batt@@ ling fields of the country , as the rival fac@@ tions are fighting here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ al@@ oa every day someone or several people will be shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of emb@@ ell@@ ished , two @-@ story mouse clicks for drug could be bigger than many houses for the Living .
forget about a minute that there is a state of &quot; tranquility &apos; , if only one card control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States .
nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the d@@ angers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , with the fault that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understanding have contributed to the murder .
first published in February the publication of an interview recorded with Dam@@ o L@@ op@@ ez , a leader of a rival ant@@ ell@@ fish fra@@ ctions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans &apos;s sons .
this publication may have off@@ ended the sons , suspected the members bought every copy of the edition as soon as they had been delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ke .
the second fault was in that Val@@ dez was not forced to force , after conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper , which had published the same story to leave the country at his own safety .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues said that he would always be there .
he was in 2003 as an experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este , when he completed five colleagues in the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars in hol@@ dings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ al@@ oa , &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without ce@@ asing the rob@@ otic problem &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the time , the newspaper served a reputation due to the cour@@ age@@ ous and hon@@ our@@ able coverage , and sales and advertising .
re@@ por@@ ters could publish it hard , hard tre@@ ad investigations without fear of the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , and the readers were fascin@@ ated by a publication that they could read stories that nobody else did .
eight years after the formation of Ri@@ odo@@ ce she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot prize &quot; for its coverage in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of journalists in the persecution of the Mexican drug history , where they also led them .
he gave himself up that he had been afraid .
&quot; I would like to live on &quot; he said about the time of the CP@@ J award .
drug trade in Sin@@ al@@ oa &quot; is a way of life , &quot; said he in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV last October .
&quot; they must take over the task of being working as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
I would not be asked : &quot; what have you done so many dead , why did you not say what went out ? &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team mis@@ ses Val@@ dez , the fun @-@ bird that could curse like a harbour workers , the friend , gener@@ ously with h@@ ugs and coun@@ sel@@ ing , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always bear his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit on the same table .
now they ask : was his love for the routine his destruction ?
his death also forced them to ask her own concerns about how to do their work on the best and to stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like to deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret start and landing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ adhesive and self @-@ maintenance .
trust its own inst@@ inc@@ ite .
when it is wrong , stay away from it .
the trouble is , the publisher of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real said &quot; od@@ our a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing with Javier has happened . &quot;
the old rules , such as he and others say , in Sin@@ al@@ oa did not apply anymore - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative dirt , weak institutions and corrupt government officials .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in the room where the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for security training , there were suddenly no mobile phones allowed . days earlier this sp@@ y@@ ware that is sold solely on governments to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
two polic@@ emen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce into a four @-@ storey building in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an area .
half in the sh@@ ear , some of the re@@ por@@ ters , whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who called the governor itself as not tru@@ st@@ worthy .
it is months ago , since the re@@ porter had gone into the mountain landscape where the drugs are fac@@ to under control .
for the edition of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has attached to three main stories .
it was the assassination of the brother of the former famous Box@@ ers Juli@@ o Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ al@@ oa .
they also had a pos@@ thum@@ ous to the state spending , focused on the home town of the Govern@@ ors .
and there was a group called in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the State Law@@ yer , a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about it , who was kidn@@ apped , or how it happened , so was careful when it was time to write that everyone in the city know , that the restaurant is a favourite locally accepted by drug authorities and authorities .
a re@@ por@@ ters learned from public records that the restaurant has been registered under the name of a policy that has belonged to the reg@@ res@@ ale Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( pr@@ i ) , which ruled all political levels almost the whole century .
several pr@@ i govern@@ ors were accused of corruption due to high @-@ time cases of corruption .
in Vill@@ ar@@ real asked Rep@@ orter , to write about previous inci@@ dents in this locality , among them one who escaped a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man .
only a few months ago , the readers had seen the column by Val@@ dez as the best informed source about the ab@@ duction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we did know what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El FLACO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of his slim body nature . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
the office of Val@@ dez was dedicated to the storage room for signs and st@@ ic@@ kers , dedicated to the Mor@@ de of journalists , because the staff have never become something of what they never expected : activists in the name of the press .
replica Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez sn@@ apped a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration for a further journalist for the office of the State Law@@ yer .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed , in the western state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an .
a burned body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is his .
in the whole country , journalists have been stronger , having organized the &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; organized in organized protests and buildings .
on that day the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez was gone into Washington and tries to collect international support for the justice in the case of Val@@ dez .
in a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ al@@ oa on the day after the assassination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities to express journalists and bring them to them because they have said the truth .
she has since then asked that she is divided by the government , because she wor@@ ried that her rage has viol@@ ated her obj@@ ec@@ tivity .
Val@@ dez had repeated that journalists in Mexico of organized crimes committed by the government officials and a united society . &quot;
in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that re@@ por@@ ters were not only killed by drug , but also on orders of politicians and security forces , who were organized with organized crimes under a blan@@ ket .
the media &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ulo 19 &quot; media group has assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials .
&quot; in Mexico you die , because they would like to hold the mouth , &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot;
obviously the mor@@ de have a deter@@ rent effect .
no one forgot the death of the Blo@@ g@@ inist Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found along with a note that was allegedly signed by the Z@@ etas @-@ Kart@@ ell : &quot; here am I because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and ear@@ phones apart from their separate head .
some stores have chosen to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border of Ch@@ ihu@@ ah@@ ua , after the assassination of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others do as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Bet@@ edo after the assassination of her director in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ are@@ z addressed publicly to the drug card with a head article on the front page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists fled from their home country , or even out of the country .
it is a painful decision .
it &apos;s hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and search for d@@ angers .
and sometimes they ch@@ ased out as the photographer of Ruben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who together with four women were murdered in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who continue to remain and continue their work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who wanted to be a poet , indicates that the drug tra@@ ff@@ icking him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to hell , and therefore I became Rep@@ orter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already ended , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce were sitting in front of the office and drank beer at once all their phones began .
a number of shooting paintings with band@@ ri@@ vals and security forces in the vicinity of the Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continues , as promised by a series of cart@@ el Em@@ bas@@ sies in the region .
you have published the news on the web site of Ri@@ odo@@ ce on mobile phone .
the front page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens places close to - a further shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the police officers , the watch , to see if they were in read@@ iness .
if they were afraid , they didn &apos;t show it .
under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper whose middle finger was visible for quite Sin@@ al@@ oa , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed its traces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you just remember thinking about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was murdered on the same day , on Javier , she asked for an intern@@ ship to send it to the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ouflage to soak his enemies
at first glance , it looks like a statue , even though a fri@@ gh@@ tening .
now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible rhin@@ oc@@ al@@ ns of a Canadian min@@ ers have been so good that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so good that they could even determine that his shoe skin was killed by r@@ ush@@ an Braun - and they said they would have had something from a &quot; in@@ quiet past . &quot;
the report in the magazine &quot; Current Biology &quot; called it as &quot; the rep@@ ented Din@@ osau@@ rs magazine ever found to be found and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs specimens of the world . &quot;
F@@ ossil is a newly discovered species of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier who lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his incredibly well preserved state has researchers that it would be a &quot; truly remarkable . &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the His@@ pan@@ te plant fres@@ cos is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Radio as he was born on 21 March 2011 in Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the North of Alberta , Canada .
he met something , which seemed out of the surrounding rock out of the square , and decided to look closer .
F@@ ossil , which was discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild animal within 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) .
after all this hard work , the final result is ready to be revealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you need only a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that it sli@@ pped , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the main aut@@ or Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum , where the creature is visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is written in the science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs individuals - the mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
researchers have found that this plant fres@@ cos , although it is covered with a arm@@ or and a wall tank resem@@ bles probably from meat vor@@ ced din@@ osau@@ rs .
the strong din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ouflage to hide themselves before smo@@ kers , and used a det@@ ach@@ ant technology that is used as counter@@ f@@ att@@ aching , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have been allowed to mix oneself better into its surroundings and to avoid enemies , say experts , which indicates that it was threatened by major din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family has made head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now named the wild animal , and it was called Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell , one of a team that has spent more than 7.000 hours to cover it carefully .
the amazing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the patterns and the form of sheds on his body .
they discovered the cont@@ empl@@ ation , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , meaning that the top of the creation was dar@@ ker than their under@@ side .
although the frag@@ mentation is common , the results are surprising as the size of Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta exceeds that of today living animals .
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ rs were ch@@ ased by plenty of pressure through flesh vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , that the evolution of the con@@ front@@ ation was fav@@ oured as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that use the frag@@ mentation - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or belt - are much smaller and viol@@ ate as prey , what sign@@ alized that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ ans was exposed to a real struggle for survival .
&quot; strong smo@@ ked behavior on a massive , strongly ge@@ ared din@@ osau@@ rs show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs smo@@ kers must have been the C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous period , &quot; said Brown .
chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ rs was red @-@ brown .
scientists continue to examine the animal on critics over his life , including its preserved gut , to find out what it eaten as its last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs died when he died , into a river , and was driven into the sea , where he sank into the sea back .
at that time Alberta was as warm as southern fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much further land@@ wards than they are today .
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with conden@@ sed skin , but also available in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the beast , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; the result is that the animal is today almost the same in the early C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous period .
you don &apos;t need to use a lot of fantasy to re@@ constru@@ ct it . if you &apos;re only a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that he is in sleep . &quot;
the chal@@ k time was a time when huge thermal di@@ odes , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ r , which stood on two legs , the earth was pier@@ ced .
although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , millions years after Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the Geor@@ gian din@@ osau@@ rs was ch@@ ased from some of his fur@@ y ancestors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ o@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 11,5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters .
the scientists whose latest findings in the trade journal Current Biology appear to believe that Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta died after death in the ocean and ratified a mud in mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn funk to the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , in the North of Alberta , Canada .
according to the museum , it is the extin@@ cted din@@ osau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to hip .
the creatures were approximately 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips designed by his shoul@@ ders .
the researchers believe that the pan@@ to@@ asted plants was sh@@ ined by the western Canada , until a floo@@ ded river was floo@@ ded into the open sea .
but the underwater fishing of the din@@ osau@@ rs preserved his arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the rem@@ n@@ ants of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin still still catch hol@@ y@@ red tank plates along the din@@ osau@@ ri@@ cher
like Michael Gre@@ sh@@ ko , for National Ge@@ ographic , is such a level of the maintenance so &apos; sel@@ dom like a win in the Lotto .
the more I see it , the more conf@@ using it .
rem@@ over remains of the skin still cover the hol@@ y@@ gen tank that carry the skull of the beast .
his re@@ lied front foot lies on its side , its five fingers crossed to the top .
I can count the sheds on his sole .
in the thunder@@ storm : Mass@@ enk@@ ar@@ amb@@ ol@@ age on A8 : many wounded
severe accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : almost 30 cars are wrapped in a mass ar@@ amb@@ ience .
there are numerous verses , kilomet@@ er@@ long St@@ ones - and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the Autobahn Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) , some 20 people were injured in the late afternoon of the afternoon .
according to the police , the police arrived at 17.00 pm between the connecting stations Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a gradient of nearly 30 vehicles , including trucks , in@@ consist@@ encies .
above the exact number of publ@@ ishers first there were no data .
it would like to be mild to moderate injuries , said one Poli@@ ze@@ z@@ cher .
a big int@@ end to rescue vehicles was at the accident .
the A8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich .
a total of ten kilometres long returned in the direction of Munich .
as a AZ @-@ re@@ porter , it also occurred on the counter @-@ way to massive disabilities - by numerous g@@ aff@@ er .
the fire brig@@ ade noted the number of vehicles that now have to be reck@@ oned with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 turns a second accident on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
in this way it was a coll@@ ision between a car transporter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : Group tested &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that has experienced every time : nothing breath@@ able in the train and sleeps .
or man &apos;s deep@@ ens in his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : buff@@ ered .
comes the Schaff@@ ner and wo@@ ke an unclean thing in the middle of the workflow .
ticket control .
but the times of breaks are over soon .
at present , the Deutsche Bahn currently test@@ ers the used bike control .
one is simply confirmed by phone , that it should be taken with its room and evalu@@ ating the ticket .
currently , there is a test run on two routes .
&quot; comes the offer , wide , we expect it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected to be available next year on many other remote transport routes in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; calls the railway cards without Schaff@@ ner .
to use it , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to have an online ticket - which already can &apos;t do the passengers .
it also has to be purchased via the app by train , the DB Navigator , which is why the most comfortable type of ticket reservation is .
and last you need a seat reservation .
because the &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot; works as : one climb@@ s in the train , calling its ticket under &quot; My Tickets &quot; .
then a button on the electronic evaluation will appear .
the train atten@@ dant can get its mobile devices a message that driver g@@ ast X is located in the train and the next seat is Y .
when the ticket manager comes to 3rd place , he knows that there is a passenger with already valuable online ticket .
so you can sleep on further , continue to keep silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has two advantages : one for the clients , one for the railway - which is to use the passengers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; those who wish to travel at the DB Navigator check in the DB Navigator check out if you are relaxed without ticket control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this enables the passengers to design their travel time in the train personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Management of DB correspondence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
second Plus : &quot; and our employees have more time than today to enter the individual customer needs . &quot;
who often goes off by train , knows that next to the late and missed trains to the biggest off@@ ences .
often , in any case you do not need any documents in any case that you need to use online tickets for the recovery of online tickets .
either the credit card or the identity card or otherwise a document must be specified .
the consequence are endless discussions between train atten@@ dant and ti@@ g@@ ast , which leads to worse mood during departure and del@@ ays during the check of your own tickets and Schaff@@ ner at the end of the time to take care of others .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and also only on the connections of the Inter@@ 915 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and Inter@@ ICE Stuttgart Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further access numbers on the same route are not enabled .
how a activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Britt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was sh@@ aken by up to their nu@@ cle@@ us .
only one day after they arrived in New York City , the St. Louis Past@@ oral was sitting on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b flat , which rented and sc@@ roll through Facebook on their phone .
they are proud of a post by som@@ eb@@ ody from the High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed an 18 year old child , and it is still on the street &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; named it there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
conf@@ using , since no one had posted the information on her feed , she joined Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was constantly prayed on their Tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white polic@@ emen in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , Mo . , was killed .
he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns le@@ bl@@ os@@ em body that was thrown on the street and stay there four hours .
&quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; thought Fer@@ rel@@ l . &quot;
but death was not new for them and their community nothing new .
it took her mobile phone to return to Twe@@ ets on humans on the Can@@ field Drive later in the evening .
there were photos of police band and people , who cried out and by a man who claimed to be the Brow@@ ns Father who brought a sign with the inscription : &quot; Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on police killed just my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she observed a live feed , where a polic@@ eman appeared in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bell@@ ding dog .
in another video , she said , and assured another police , and cried , saying , &quot; I will kill you ... animals are all killing . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remin@@ ded of their statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder , which we are acc@@ ust@@ omed to us and which we can call . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this moment I felt cont@@ emp@@ t .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home next day .
after landing at 23 o &apos;clock she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would drive on the next morning to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in the cinem@@ as from the 11 .
it is a history of survival and dis@@ si@@ p@@ ation , the strength and resistance of resistance , which consists of the perspective of human beings living in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers .
when Fer@@ rel@@ l , with her daughter , carried a flower dress , and a right crown , carried out on Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , the two had a conversation , that they had countless times before this morning , &quot; about the black experience and the black condition . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , as I taught you , when I have taught you when they have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they remembered that she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now going to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy , and that wasn &apos;t really good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not take it , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l later .
&quot; what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
it has to know and see it and be mounted in it .
it must be well developed , not only acti@@ vis@@ m and organization , but also the various layers of the black experience and the black constitution , and what we must do to free to rid ourselves .
even if I have Happ@@ iness to give her an experience , in whom they do not have experienced rac@@ ism in person , it is not different than the next black women child .
I have the feeling I would give her a bad service to keep them far away . &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , was at South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became a camps on the possible non @-@ indictment by Chief Apostle Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there are Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter with a local business lover , lunch made .
they prepared bags before and helped to pass on demonstr@@ ators .
slowly began to accept a new type of acti@@ vis@@ m for fer@@ rel@@ l shape .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my acti@@ vis@@ m has changed completely after August 9 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said and noted that she was a student at the University of Missouri @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student N@@ ow Association and focused on food justice and health benefits in black municipalities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it is all come . &quot;
weeks later , Fer@@ rel@@ l met on Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the film &apos;s co @-@ directors of the film .
fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cin@@ emat@@ ograph@@ er Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to record only &quot; what happened .
a question came from Fer@@ rel@@ l to the meaning : &quot; will you be documented or tries to find a story that you can use ? &quot;
this sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often by white - in a community that benef@@ ited from their pain and their resistance .
as fol@@ ay@@ an recently declared in an interview : &quot; we heard that people who were born in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on and grew up , they did not cent@@ red their voices , and we wanted to do it different . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area that is known for his acti@@ vis@@ m around To@@ o @-@ occup@@ ants .
his commitment brought Fer@@ rel@@ l the project closer , along with six other nati@@ ves followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary is not any one who speaks for us or talking with us . we speak , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me as these people are represented , because then I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to focus on fer@@ rel@@ ing experience - in order to show that it is in motion &quot; not about a Messiah @-@ guide , but for a community that come together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most obvious participant in the film .
in fol@@ ly , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; sur@@ pris@@ ingly personal aspects of Fer@@ rel@@ ls Life , as she loves and mar@@ ries her wife .
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l and laugh@@ ed as they saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the dec@@ ei@@ ving of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Fer@@ rel@@ ls &apos;s history is the role of the black gay women in the wider Black Li@@ ves movement .
two of the three fo@@ unders of the movement that have marked the film &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in 2012 , influenced by the &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; film in social media .
&quot; black , pregnant women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; and therefore we fight continuously at different fron@@ ts .
black , pregnant women must bear the main load of everything . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an agree that &quot; the movement really is kept by the black women and a lot of black women . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it insi@@ sted that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a fast type of action , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Fer@@ rel@@ l was chosen because of their identity in the heart of the film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who raised this energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no co@@ incidence , although she was on the front of the front , because of a life in these cruci@@ fix@@ ings , a woman , pregnant woman says so much on the game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel the energy through the screen . &quot;
in the meantime , the news @-@ cameras in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on have been long gone , but the ra@@ cial between the congregation and the police continue to continue .
fer@@ rel@@ l is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years because of the blocking of a highway near a demonstration .
she describes the social atmosphere of the area that she calls her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
nevertheless she cl@@ ashed herself on a song and she felt at this memory since three years ago in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on on the road .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love one another and support .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : TV @-@ readers discuss bit gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bit gallery moves the people , although it is not yet a long time being built .
but the idea of a shopping centre on the Sü@@ ver of the pedestrian zone are split since the first presentation in 2009 the population in fears and opponents .
the topic is hardly possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; People &apos;s and Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic is discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the one @-@ bit gallery say : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , coming from the other side : &quot; doesn &apos;t need man &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ aking ) or quite simply : &quot; s@@ lan@@ der ! &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) .
while the fears make sure that a gallery attracts more clients to the city , the other businesses will benefit , fear the opponents that the pedestrian zone p@@ aus@@ ed .
in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the premises where the farmhouse is located in which 13 direct dealers will offer its products .
the construction work will be concluded with the beginning of the construction work .
the Gallery M@@ acher want to integrate a Mark@@ thalle in the new building - namely a Bed@@ a place with the possibility to sitting outside .
Simone rooms : &quot; we &apos;ve been buying almost a weekly in the farms for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cake of the women are always happy .
we have also discovered the but@@ cher shop for us .
we would like to wish that during and above all , after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this promotion .
in other cities there is also .
the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct market her@@ mits in a market hall in the gallery , arrives at the height of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new project should not be low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva Kil@@ ic : &quot; what the shopping mall in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , home or supermarkets : I find the super@@ flu@@ ous .
there are already enough in our city .
you can see how many shops have been empty , some for months and years .
but since there is not even a regular weekly market , it is the more important that at least the market place will remain at least .
because after all , the goods offered there are fresh , most are offered directly from the producer and is inexpensive .
as you see , store shops in a shopping centre can be rented only by larger companies , because the rental rentals are often not portable for retailers .
too bad , special business , there are almost no more and what is left , will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf tra@@ ff@@ icking : &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall does not fit for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the farmer market place during the construction time ?
the old ED@@ EK@@ A would be the solution - even if the bit gallery is actually coming .
or makes it possible to distribute all businesses from Bit@@ burg to drive out all businesses from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; this will not work .
and a shopping center , which is empty , no one needs .
in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real pe@@ asant market instead of this gallery .
but for a pe@@ asant market place , it gives no place thanks to the mad@@ ness thanks - how I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess building projects in Bit@@ burg did no room more .
when the farm@@ houses are made , again a piece of culture will disappear . &quot;
an appropriate simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
in the middle of the room of Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are visible - white , black and brown , which are almost im@@ perc@@ ep@@ tible - that depend on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ les and Haar@@ lem , which were sent to you by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent out the ex@@ cer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former intelligence analy@@ tics put in a 35 @-@ year sentence , after performing diplomatic messages about the website of Wiki@@ Le@@ aks .
the new exhibition opened on 2 August , A Bec@@ oming Res@@ em@@ bl@@ ance ( An appropriate simil@@ arity ) .
it is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline took their expertise in technology , computer science and art , whose condem@@ nation was converted by Barack Obama , when he was only three days in his ministry .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by the algorith@@ mic analysis of the DNA that could look like with these gen@@ om@@ ic data , such as someone could not only look to the mol@@ ability of DNA data - the many ways , as they can be interpreted and the in@@ firm@@ ness Det@@ er@@ min@@ ism of these interpre@@ tations - but also to the identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born when Brad@@ ley Edward was born , but already since their pu@@ ber@@ ty over the identification as a woman , was condemned in 2013 because of 20 accus@@ ations against the law law , computer and theft .
by the prison , her painting was supp@@ ressed , so much that it only gave a single photo - a grain @-@ white , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in the man@@ ing is clearly sitting on a driver seat and a plat@@ in@@ bl@@ onde per@@ ig carries - with which it was associated .
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the great success of their 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; .
in this , the artist portraits of strange arti@@ facts like cigarette bl@@ ink and chew@@ ing gum , producing the DNA from the waste to produce a picture that could look like these people .
this was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing , while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press preview of the new exhibition .
and it could not be visited for that time and could not be photographed , therefore you took contact with Chelsea , and asked them if they wanted to do a DNA portrait .
the artist and her pris@@ oned M@@ use have been carried out by the Bri@@ eff@@ el who ruled several letters during the course of two years .
she even proclaimed a com@@ ic &quot; supp@@ orter Images , &quot; which he predic@@ ts a future in which the President Chel@@ y@@ ish Jud@@ gment would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama had actually just a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ings ended up after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas , was a welcome kind of lucky meeting .
there is also now in the opening of the exhibition something deep and Star@@ kes , since Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ t of governmental forces and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to resol@@ ve the rigid sphere , which he should fix further .
as a De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg after the wei@@ rd timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things would happen from a certain reason . &quot;
in one on the wall of the gallery , man@@ ing with their over@@ sized signature among them ( the &quot; i &quot; in their family name is provided with a heart ) an end of &quot; automatic de@@ formation , whose foundation sex , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - an thous@@ and@@ ths of Cs and Gs and As , in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg trusted by the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or Nu@@ st@@ ot@@ ide after the highly developed scientific Lex@@ icon of the artist ) , as amaz@@ ingly , at least in biological respec@@ ts , we all are .
&quot; what people are hop@@ efully say that our gen@@ ome is not therefore car@@ es , who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how sub@@ jective them are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works of 2007 , micro@@ ious Mem@@ ories , also is to be seen .
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , hence the 30 of these stories . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition is kept in an own room , is one side of the Com@@ ic @-@ Nov@@ elle mentioned above .
she shows Mann@@ ing , as she appears with a free @-@ hand @-@ trap in the United States from the United States as King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they ch@@ ill your words , then they have won . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; never put the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter which she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist who gre@@ et from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still can only see if I speak about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was predic@@ tive in the com@@ ic book - but when it should do it , then she will be greeted in the middle of the room of m@@ asks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simulation , which are joined by their own gen@@ om@@ ic simulation .
that was also targeted how everything was written in the exhibition until reaching the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ings St@@ ature ) , where their genetic h@@ ap@@ ric@@ um were written with a pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past I had her on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a human volume , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to feel like a mass movement that was formed with Chelsea , as the movement that were behind their liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will conclu@@ de the WA@@ DA road plan in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Russian Vice President Mut@@ ko
the Russian Vice @-@ re@@ mi@@ er Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it will not take long until the remaining criteria of the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a certain stage of ful@@ fill@@ ment of the criteria of the road@@ map R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA road plan was updated in this regard , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the road@@ map of WA@@ DA for compliance with the code , which describes the criteria for re@@ inst@@ igation of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the web site of the organization .
according to Mut@@ ko , he has nothing to be able to concern himself for Russia .
&quot; everything was announced , everything will be implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and the WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , one of the criteria mentioned in the list , however , states that Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping authorities have signed the reported results of the report presented by the WA@@ DA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren by Canadian attor@@ ney Richard McLaren .
Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we lead the investigation through because our anti @-@ d@@ oping system has got an error .
all measures have been implemented .
but there was no state programs , and we will not give something that doesn &apos;t exist . &quot;
Mut@@ k@@ os words voted with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , director of the independent Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping Commission , agreed .
in conversation with the Russian sales department R@@ sport at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v gave problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping organizations , but then said : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report about disp@@ uted positions and regulations .
no one has to accept these report un@@ conditional , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 in the course of the D@@ oping Sk@@ and@@ als by WA@@ DA from the implementation of D@@ oping control in Russia .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordin@@ ate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK anti @-@ d@@ oping ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
after a visit to the main part of the organization in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA @-@ General@@ director Olivier Nig@@ gli declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA is moving in the right direction &quot; to be used again .

the start @-@ ups that your company will help to become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure your luck at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys did not work .
responses were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - fr@@ au@@ dul@@ ent .
and even if you promised An@@ on@@ ym@@ ity , some workers do not trau@@ ma the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was simply no consistency and obj@@ ec@@ tivity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Society Madison Re@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also has people outside the outside .
a new breed of human Resources Start @-@ ups is on the wax to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licens@@ ing of software that has enabled the specific purpose of the measurement of the employee engagement , it allows companies to discuss , speci@@ alty groups and demo@@ graphic groups to deal , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow C @-@ Suite exec@@ u@@ tives to handle and contact them directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for the persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your business ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analy@@ tics tools used by companies to measure employees .
Er@@ ret@@ t said that she has a better view into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t .
in addition to the Sn@@ ap @-@ surveys and poll@@ s of certain teams , it offers a heat map of the company that shows most complaints , and which exec@@ u@@ tives have low condition results - that you can drill on , why .
companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture , so you do not have been involved in the next h@@ ber , which has been published in Sk@@ and@@ ale , since then one ex @-@ staff has published a blog post , who describes the environment of blasphem@@ ies , among those who have spoken , punished .
for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business possibility according to a glance .
the Global Governance , Regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion value by 2020 , according to the financial technical website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Denver , Colorado , start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent the bad behaviour and recognize , saw a growing interest and activity beginning of this year in the middle of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ er@@ dit .
converting has almost 600 clients , including air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tesla .
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
like G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ tible companies to send customized &quot; pulse &quot; surveys to collect confi@@ dential questions in real time and view the warmth card of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line , which can report the latest behavior .
and when the main business leader is included , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court of public opinion has captured the regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a company is found that his staff is po@@ or@@ ly treated or is un@@ eth@@ ical , it can experience precious consequences through consumers @-@ boy@@ cott , workers @-@ flu@@ ence and complaints , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25.000 employees and more than 500 locations , Conver@@ tible for over a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures , and have a simple way to reach their corporate headquarters .
previously , if a cler@@ k wanted to report a problem , he had to find one telephone number or email for the corporate headquarters , a formal appeal and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often an en@@ ligh@@ tening and un@@ comfortable experience , James Vit@@ rano , Ruby TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ Y@@ S General Coun@@ sel , who said , there was no good opportunity to track the complaints from employees .
well , since the company Conver@@ tible , you can have problems that were previously hidden by exec@@ u@@ tives that were hidden in offices in cities or states - like discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment , or un@@ ob@@ tru@@ er practitioners .
&quot; I can come closer to this holi@@ stic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience of employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who runs the risk management Group by Ruby Tuesday .
&quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment and legal dispute . &quot;
companies began to take eth@@ ics , values and employees in 2002 , after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed because of eth@@ ical violation by En@@ ron Sk@@ and@@ al , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social Media &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came to their right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that they knew not that they were not able to avoid their dirty clothes online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; prior to the use of technology to surveillance the eth@@ ics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ lin@@ t as well as Conver@@ cent offer your software as a service , and ass@@ essing the company with recur@@ ring fees for use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance that finds the approval by Venture Capital Invest@@ ors to have supported both start @-@ ups .
Conver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies like Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , where the total capital raised to $ 47 million .
Gl@@ itz@@ inger won $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer &apos;s Venture Partners and brought the whole financing to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising in view of the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex in research that shows that today &apos;s employees of jobs would expect more than before .
in competitive markets such as Sil@@ icon Valley are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects only .
staff want to have the feeling that you are accepted and estimated that you will give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if men are glad , in a company will feel that they will do , and they will feel more strongly committed to make this company , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Den@@ ee Experience in Link@@ ed@@ In who used both Conver@@ cent as well as G@@ lin@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
investors reach R@@ end@@ ite when their portfolio companies run well . company run well , if employees are involved and engaged .
if the Analytics tools are involved in third parties , commitment and the use of employees , it is no wonder that you can find support .
data on the employee engagement is important after experts of the workplace culture .
but the data are us@@ eless if the administrator of a company does not take action .
in fact , if a company asks employees after your feedback , it may have a expect@@ ation that change is on its way .
and if the change doesn &apos;t come fast enough , or not at all , this dis@@ appoint@@ ments and employees can be negoti@@ able .
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you have to be ready to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen themselves to have left to the collection of data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you are not going to follow the employees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have ye really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
are you going to take care of it ?
and who does not worry about why should I ? &quot;
Madison Re@@ ed , who is now monthly employee in@@ quiries led , was able to initi@@ ate measures on the same day if a problem is reported via G@@ lin@@ t , so saving .
and after collecting the feedback of fru@@ str@@ ated employees , it was able to organize and organize several teams within the company and to add a communications training to tackle the problems .
with Ruby Tuesday , the company will always find new in@@ sights over the employees , and it hopes that in a long view , this leads to a better binding of workers in an industry that is known for high revenues .
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; said Vit@@ rano .
&quot; and if you lose people , you lose also customers .
and if you lose customers , you will lose companies .
N@@ CAA remov@@ es the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for Bru@@ ins
it starts at 23 o &apos;clock , a lot of U@@ CL@@ A foot@@ ball@@ ast on one side of the team &apos;s new exercise fields in the campus .
some have pulled out their tri@@ cot and show back the back full of silence from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team this unt@@ ill is a lunch break .
players who are enrolled in the summer courses are returning after the three @-@ hour practice sessions , before they return on the next morning at 6 : 30 o &apos;clock to the Water@@ man Football Center .
&quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real pedal mill , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before the Monday was closed .
the N@@ CAA elim@@ in@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of the player and it has really extended its days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three training sessions of the U@@ CL@@ A will begin at 19 : 15 a.m. , in order to just@@ ify the already completed sched@@ ules of the player .
the compromise away from the two days is more than one day when the brood was post@@ pon@@ ed to the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time , during Mor@@ as six games times in West@@ wood practical exercises .
they should hold 18 exercises in the course of August . 20 before the formal game Prepar@@ ations for their pre@@ lu@@ de against Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he supports the rules change of N@@ CAA , even if they add another point to the player .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous loads three or four days on them , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they hur@@ d@@ led it , they pl@@ agu@@ ed , and they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think once we come to Saturday and we have more time , it is really great . &quot;
the U@@ CL@@ A will termin@@ ate its practice as soon as the camp is ended , what is exposed to the clear view of its fields from an adjacent parking and adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of elevated levels , which is already a protective grid behind a door@@ posts , no easy task will be .
Bru@@ ins players are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend but Mor@@ a dream that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far too much to think that people can rent there a room and then go to it a practice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video and one exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good business .
but we have security forces there and we have security forces to parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I &apos;m not doing so too big worry about it .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with folders from third parties and their findings under the original entry , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake News .
the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated automatic learning methods to send potential wrong reports and to send it to the fact that may be displayed in the original article in the original article .
Facebook was critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called f@@ ake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the U.S. presidential elections in 2016 .
the problem is also become a major political topic in Europe , with the French voters being floo@@ ded in May with false stories , and Germany supports a plan according to the social media networks , if it doesn &apos;t succeed to eliminate fli@@ pped post@@ ings as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement on German , that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany a test of the new facts review will be launched .
&quot; in addition to the knowledge that stories of fact exam@@ ining third parties , people want more context to meet the decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook messages in a blog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook will continue to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; test in conjunction with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; related article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and to other changes to its news feed , to reduce false news . &quot; &quot; &quot;
create a com@@ ic novel : a Castle in the history of England
in his younger past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was visible in a squ@@ e@@ eze @-@ music video and was an Schl@@ u@@ pf@@ l for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ 1980 and 1980 @-@ 1980 .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of tur@@ bul@@ ent history of his hom@@ ely seat in the Ab@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now for inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ ha@@ ari@@ ous Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a pre@@ ference for historical documents .
&quot; I find it so nice to look at the manuscript by someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; en@@ ligh@@ tens the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documented the families who have lived in Scot@@ ney . Isaac Lenk@@ ie@@ wi@@ cz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des that is based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British library - a project that he found unexpected .
&quot; I only respon@@ ds to the thum@@ b print on the side of a letter which was written by a double patient in the 1700 @-@ year @-@ old , who worked for the Jac@@ o@@ bin@@ s , &quot; he says .
&quot; this is his thum@@ b pressure !
and letters always smell like smoke , because then a fire was kindled because of light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has a effect as he himself would be even though .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is beaten with old pap@@ ules , that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council in England and lived for almost four months in a castle ( &quot; to be hon@@ est : I have a little over my welcome &quot; ) that everything seems to be true .
Rho@@ dos spent his days to explore the vi@@ kt@@ ian &quot; new &quot; castle , expl@@ oring the archives and to study the many treasures and cur@@ ios@@ ities of the castle , such as about the mon@@ ey@@ ed hy@@ enas in the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the tr@@ ench .
he walked through the grounds and ruins of the old castle , and spoke with coun@@ ties , gar@@ dening and sometimes also with the artists who worked in the illustrations of his book .
then , at night he drank &quot; Whis@@ key and started writing . &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown because the National Trust was only received the full access in 2006 when the last job was , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey died .
when Rho@@ des arrived one decade later , the employee began to take care of the archive as &quot; hundreds of years ago , in which Arist@@ oc@@ rates said &quot; Oh , it described it in the attic . &quot;
diary , letters from the period of the Engl@@ ish@@ man Em@@ pi@@ res , maps , who possessed : &quot; you could mean that country @-@ conflict would be bor@@ ing , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight the two families .
boys , let all go on his ais@@ le ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection will use the castle as a starting point to take a wider base into the English history , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , who leaves the newly built castle to join the pe@@ asant revol@@ ving of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of an u@@ pro@@ ar which appeared in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book with the title &apos; Kn@@ igh@@ tly Famil@@ ies of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , says Rho@@ des .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pe@@ asant revol@@ ves in this area and I thought , an uprising was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maybe the two are joined together ? &quot;
other stories are firmly ro@@ oted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , who tells the story of the Jesu@@ it patent for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The Sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers &apos; , depicted in which the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l is depicted in the 18th century , he filled his own Beer , having filled a sar@@ g with stones ( a discovery , which was only dug only years later ) .
the Dar@@ rel@@ ls are Rho@@ des &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gent@@ l@@ emen encour@@ ages to be able to make debts and spend money for things they could not aff@@ ord .

with the covering of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Marien@@ kap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf has started the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f on Friday its campaign for the introduction of a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) .

&quot; we think this ( of course ! ) do not really , write them on their released website yesterday .
&quot; but we use this measure to win your attention .
and to make clear that something is better than it seems .
basically , we are the permanent convic@@ tion that we know as bath Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizens to know the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city very well . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the action is more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one logo and a slogan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it is further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is true to form@@ ulate a stand@@ able promise , one that gives the city a distinctive feature . &quot;

military re@@ forms in Turkey - Erd@@ og@@ an &apos;s fear of the army
every year in the beginning of August , the Military Military Council ( Y@@ as ) has served in Ankara on retirement pension and transports in officer cor@@ ps .
so this week also .
at first glance a normal process .
but nothing is routine for the Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt .
the session took place no more in the building of the General Staff , as previously , but also in the office seat of the Prime Minister .
under the presi@@ dency of the heads of government , the five Vice @-@ President and the Minister for Defence , In@@ ner , Justice and Foreign Affairs is part of the government .
the civilians in Y@@ as were in the convic@@ tion .
the government re@@ trac@@ ts the re@@ ins in the military .
Chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , the Air Force and the Navy were removed .
since the failed coup , State Secretary Erd@@ og@@ an 169 has fired the 326 gener@@ als and ad@@ mir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - usually due to alleged connections to the move of the exile @-@ Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which sees the ge@@ og@@ an as wire past@@ ry .
for 486 people who have been involved immediately in the coup attempt , will be negoti@@ ated in Ankara since this week .
already on the day after the coup , Erd@@ og@@ an had named the overthrow of God as the present gift , as he give him the opportunity to clean the forces . &quot;
but did Erd@@ og@@ an the army really in the handle ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Un@@ dis@@ comfort in the Military headquarters &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the general Staff , they give concern itself to an increasing &quot; Islamic &quot; of the Army , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself among others in the repe@@ al of the head of the head , the newspaper wrote .
the Grand Master in the army and the power sector enters in any way .
in mid @-@ July , Erd@@ og@@ an ordered a further 73@@ 95 local polic@@ eman , including 230@@ 3 police officers and 546 soldiers .
in this case , Erd@@ og@@ an seemed to t@@ ist the military .
gener@@ als earlier than the actual lor@@ ds of the country .
three times , it was called upon their role as a gu@@ ardi@@ ans of the sec@@ ular state rules .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erd@@ og@@ an passed the power of the military step by step , not least under calling for the reform of the European Union .
former officers say , Erd@@ og@@ an cast targeted a Islam@@ isation of the forces .
in the magazine &quot; Voc@@ al Europe , &quot; a well @-@ called officer , who was seeking asylum after the coup attempt in fear of persecution from abroad , the Turkish army will be &quot; full extrem@@ ists and sal@@ af@@ ists &quot; in a few years .

Washington announces the rules for the Green Card
it will give a new US @-@ immig@@ ration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted from the media .
he looks forward to lower the legal immig@@ rants to 50,000 a year , stric@@ ter regulations for a temporary work permit and limitations for families @-@ oriented Visa .
the new rules are proposed by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill should be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , save $ and billion dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do this by exp@@ orting the way the way to the citizens from other countries green cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent the chains migration and replace the current system .
this new procedure is being addressed to the candidates who have the financial funds to support itself and show knowledge that will benefit in our economy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , cited by the American media .
ministry wants to be rehabil@@ it@@ ated by the Department of Renn@@ ers
and again , over the past few months , over the future of the racing cycl@@ sh@@ utt@@ les had been disp@@ uted - it is supposed to go quickly .
even before the end of the year the route is to be built on which the tourist railroad station is built .
in order to secure the future of the race course in the long term , according to information from the Ministry of Transport a year , construction work will begin on the route .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to order the distance of Ilmenau @-@ Renn@@ weg and to be rehabil@@ it@@ ated , the country knows everything for the tourism important association , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the State Secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs for the maintenance of the route was reduced to about 2.5 million euros .
of this sum , the land over@@ take the country 75 percent .
the contract , on which the shuttle is supposed to be ordered in the future of the country , will definitely be voted , explained S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the Southeast of Southern Rail@@ ways are already one of the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the ti@@ met@@ able to tra@@ ded the vehicles and quality standards , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
this would be recommended for the race shuttle service on December 2017 .
the race shuttle is one of all popular railway stations between the Ilmenau and Renn@@ stei@@ g train stations .
during the last months , in the course of a pilot operation , the distance of sufficient many people was used to order them again in the future .
the route is also very di@@ lap@@ id@@ ated in parts .
the climb of sex robots is real , and we should worry about your concerns
just as you thought it could not be crazy in 2017 , a new report about technological developments in the area of sex robots .
yes , indeed .
sex robot are currently a big thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , emer@@ itus professor of rob@@ ot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we have to begin doing their ascent .
customers can choose the eye colour of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and type of fingers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people are fun , but the company provide a lot of it , and we will be able to see them much more frequently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Shar@@ key at the release of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed by their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with aware of human reactions that can be achieved by artificial intelligence .
the user can adjust its robot also according to its belie@@ fs &quot; and choose everything from the eye color of the robot on the form of breast warning to type or color of his fing@@ ern@@ ails .
but it is still wor@@ r@@ ying , as many robots have the &quot; personal@@ ities &quot; that would look like a step@@ ping woman progressive .
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed to robots with a silicone skin .
the Real@@ Bot@@ ix robot makes it possible for example to adapt their robots to the properties that it will be appe@@ aling as for example .
and then there is still the True Compan@@ ion developed Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robot with pre @-@ programmed personal@@ ities like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which gives the impression of rel@@ ays and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with a &quot; advent@@ u@@ rous &quot; personality . &quot;
Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality who is adapted to your personality as good as possible , &quot; war@@ ms the website of True Compan@@ ion .
so you like what you like , and they don &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day they also have their keys - quite like real people !
it can be tired , be fixed on con@@ vers@@ ation or she can be &quot; in mood . &quot;
there are many be@@ ast@@ oun@@ ding aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least , because they really replace real human relationships - but the in@@ dem@@ nity of rape , if one goes a step on fri@@ gi@@ d ( called here : contra@@ di@@ ly ) Far@@ rah , troubled one most .
on his website true True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) could have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; it is called on the website .
however , these sex robots are not only a Fet@@ ish or just another sexual playing .
their birth and their increasing refin@@ ement show a slightly dar@@ ker and deep@@ ening in our culture , on a retreat from the ideal solution of the sexes go to sex with sub@@ jug@@ ation as an optional en@@ core .
most men , of course , do not hold any sex robot , and while the FR@@ R will notice its rising popularity , they still remain pre@@ limin@@ arly on the edge of the consumer culture .
but what goes out of the bound@@ ary zones may be very instru@@ ctive in terms of the spirit of the time , in which we live , very instru@@ ctive .
and many people are not wei@@ rd or bad until them the free market gives permission to them .
there is a certain over@@ l@@ apping , that these highly developed sex robots at a time occur in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide , in which there are a president in the White House which thus ge@@ ared , women attacked sexual assault .
the ab@@ hor@@ n@@ most aspect of the TV series &apos; The hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The report of the handmaid &apos; ) are not the graphic images that acts in@@ separable bodies and the cast eyes , but as realistic this vision .
the Republic of Gilead is a jump but at the moment this will not feel like a big jump .
the goal behind those sex robots , there is a physical simil@@ arity to real women as realistic as technically possible ( if also with por@@ no@@ star propor@@ tions ) .
their builders want to feel good , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , on the point , if it is about their &quot; personal@@ ities &quot; , the robot places no real women .
they cannot be split or simply go away from their companions .
they don &apos;t have a placement or background history , nothing , which indicates independence or anything , what the imagination could distur@@ b .
other words : they are f@@ eit slaves .
or to express it in the speech of 2017 : ma@@ ids
tr@@ um@@ ps great achievement ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney for the in@@ compreh@@ ension of healthy human dig@@ nity
it has become a b@@ yp@@ assing of the Tr@@ ump era , that the political circuits that have polar@@ ised the US voters , also split families in small format .
around the Christmas and harvest in the United States there were newspapers with advice about how to get to the hor@@ ror from Tr@@ ump selectable relatives .
we tigh@@ ten all supp@@ os@@ edly to help our filter bub@@ bles .
less not@@ ted , the power of Tr@@ um@@ ps has been together to accommodate families .
I chose this because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ directional slide show that lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family , who visited me this week in New York .
she remin@@ ded me that the unity could have a mighty effect against a joint enemy .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone who knows it , including the Republi@@ can family , who strug@@ gled for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite strange on the same side .
in order to be the dining table there is certainly a good thing , but it falls in a further context that this also produces significant risks .
the left hand was strengthened by tr@@ ump , but the un@@ oxi@@ fying effect of his Presidency has the power to move all to the right .
if we speak of &quot; normal@@ ization &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the gra@@ zing possibility that we will not stum@@ ble with our bi@@ b of one day .
there is , however , there is another long @-@ term scenario in which Tr@@ ump rep@@ ublic@@ ans of the right wing &quot; normal@@ izes , &quot; which suddenly appeared in comparison to his standards suddenly as in@@ compreh@@ en@@ ation of suspected .
now I find myself from an active nost@@ al@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s new version of the back@@ ward - the dog on the Aut@@ od@@ ach , which saw 14 % income tax ( but at least did we know how his tax return ) - both occur in the comparison to Tr@@ ump in fact a very mild criminal off@@ ences .
when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans must be spiritu@@ ally healthy to qualify as un@@ meas@@ ur@@ able improvement .
when my c@@ ousin in the city was , we brought our children to the Car@@ ou@@ sel at Central Park , the largest of the Car@@ ou@@ sel &apos;s park department , and the best three dollars that you can spend in the city if you do not need caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cr@@ um@@ y and the animals are turning round to look full of fear over their own shoul@@ ders - most fin@@ dest and climate @-@ speaking music gives this a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings are grown old , the Sky@@ lines become familiar to offer a lot of exc@@ itement , and the reality of the city will not be justified .
five and thirty years later , and I &apos;m still not over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss Cottage - the subjects @-@ Pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not counted - but a large roundabout in the north of London .
the Central Park @-@ Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a strange magical experience since here two @-@ year @-@ old , one 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ year @-@ old and all have a great time .
if I could have to evaluate the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one has asked later .
on the other hand , I was forced to rate my &quot; Experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could through my credit card .
in the coffee house on the corner of my street , it is the same , plus the option to balance with a 15 % tip of drinking - this to buy something about the shop table .
this does not only lead to a slow@@ down of what actually should be a neutral exchange , but also pract@@ ising pressure on the server to enter personality to a situation in which is no necessary .
the poor woman in the department store ap@@ ologi@@ zed , while I f@@ ade the experience to rich my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us transferred to the hospital with chest pain
Pist@@ ori@@ us has left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time .
last year , he was brought to the hospital for the treatment of Schn@@ itten , which he suffered from prison authorities after a fall in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was convicted of murder of prosec@@ uting the prosec@@ uting attor@@ neys for murder in murder .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning of Valentine &apos;s 2013 , giving them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ toria on her .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he beha@@ ved his gir@@ l@@ friend for a n@@ igh@@ tly in@@ penetration , hidden in the cabin .
the prosec@@ uting attor@@ neys have announced their intention to submit this time against the six @-@ year sentence by Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say that they would be op@@ aque .
the National Prosecutor authorities stated that it will be appe@@ aled to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the verdict could be heard this year .
Pist@@ ori@@ us is danger that his sentence is increased to 15 years when the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .

software update for diesel vehicles : what people want to know now
how exactly does the software update instead ?
do you have to participate in the action ?
overview of the main questions and answers .
BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group software updates have offered a total of around 5.3 million cars for the diesel summit .
they should improve emission @-@ behavior of automobiles in Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 dies@@ els or worse than are excluded .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin from ACE Auto Club Europe is ass@@ ess@@ ments :
is the new action compulsory ?
no , the handled software updates are voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the oblig@@ atory updates are valid only for vehicles that have Schumann software &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their dis@@ arm@@ ament is arranged by the Federal Office of the Swiss Federal Office ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced a fast conversion in the next few months , but not named exact date .
Daimler has informed everyone concerned .
if it is due to be a inspection , it will be done within the frame .
how long will the change come up in a total ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; S@@ met@@ anin believes .
the connections from the commitment of the manufacturer as well as from the political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for we have seen , will@@ ingly offered the car manufacturers at the subject of the environment until now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long shall the update last ?
the upgrade itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
temporary t@@ aller could be to get an appointment .
what do drivers want to drive the car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ACE leads to wait .
probably foreign manufacturers would follow , so S@@ met@@ anin .
is there a massive price fall of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE fears that .
but in the regions where passengers are dro@@ pping .
in rural areas , no impair@@ ments for older diesel .
the ACE are av@@ eng@@ ed , with a sale yet to wait .

the first prize ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to be polit@@ ically .
one of the winners will not come - from protest .
LL Cool J ( 49 ) gets one of the most sought @-@ after awards at the prestigious Kennedy Center .
as the cultural institution on Thursday announced that in this year , singer Gloria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ on@@ el Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ograph@@ in Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV @-@ producer Norman L@@ ear ( 95 ) .

traditionally US President Donald Tr@@ ump will stage a reception and together with his wife Mel@@ ania on the award ceremony .
the winner of L@@ ear announced that the winner of Sp@@ ear announced that it has already announced to participate in the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this presi@@ dency has decided to neg@@ lec@@ ting the Arts and Human Rights - they even imp@@ acted to them the means &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ at stressed that she will use st@@ ump to clear their visibility .

we do the city li@@ fel@@ ong
Roland W@@ acker , ha@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ der , enters into R@@ ente in the next year .
the place is already written - suitable applicants , however , are ra@@ r .
since 31 years W@@ acker has been a t@@ acker city master .
and the work gives him a great fun as he medi@@ ates in the Press Conference .
it reports varied but challenging tasks that wait for his success@@ ors .
at the same time I ad@@ mi@@ red , so far , no application will be fulfilled .
the city is looking for the next possible time a architects or engineer .
so , under the cont@@ emp@@ t of the regular period of notice , it is still enough time to el@@ aboration .
since Has@@ lach was responsible for the administrative community as a sub@@ sid@@ ad authority , the applicants must be related to the applicants .
because this function will keep the city on any case .
if they could not be filled out , they would have to leave the citizens for consultation until Offen@@ burg .
but civil proximity to the city and himself is important , W@@ acker that reports from a good company lim@@ a as well as good mood between the authority and citizens .
in more than 30 years in office , some important projects have collected on the W@@ acker on pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are doing the city of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is confident about the building office and his staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a areas and the drop @-@ parking lot approximately are exposed .
the Kin@@ den bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the st@@ adi@@ on@@ san@@ itation is still subject .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter alone will strike at around 1.5 million Euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we do it correctly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estimated W@@ acker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my success@@ ors .
the work here is fun . &quot;
design be present for a city master of large games room .
with ha@@ l@@ ach@@ s own building yard and gar@@ dener &apos;s , it can be flexi@@ bly re@@ acted on versat@@ ility .
&quot; you can move a lot , &quot; so W@@ acker , and the design of the Green Are@@ as are often mentioned by citizens and visitors .
since the old town is listed as a historical monument , it is important to have &quot; an eye to have what it fits , &quot; when new buildings are approved , emphas@@ ises the constitu@@ ent city master .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ master carries high responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end everything will work on my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with assistance and coordination he can count on long @-@ term staff : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( High construction ) has been in existence since ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( Low Water ) has been in existence for 15 years .
also that his successor stays long , W@@ acker : &quot; we are looking for someone who really identi@@ fies and stay with the job . &quot;
because continu@@ ity is not only important for a good operating lim@@ a , but also for the further design of the city .
he who wants to inherit Roland W@@ acker , should be a graduate engineer as a graduate engineer or Bachelor with expert architecture and have good expertise in the areas of construction and building planning .
building planning , construction and civil engineering , building planning , tom@@ b@@ assist , municipal court courtyard with construction yard and municipal gar@@ dening including under@@ mining authority , including monuments .
bike on lines are thrown : southern route blocked
according to the police , the previously unknown T@@ ender had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway station in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines .
these were so strongly damaged that the her@@ on freight must be stopped .
the investigations go out of two male perpet@@ rators and search for the night hours after them .
close to the Tat@@ ar , a ros@@ strainer and a bike driver had been observed from witnesses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ itz@@ ring , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB speaker Christoph Pos@@ ch said to A@@ PA . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ rators were brought to us in great risk and end@@ anger@@ ed traffic .
in addition to the damage to the Lo@@ k and the plant , as well as a delay @-@ minute and the costs for rail traffic could also be sent to the perpet@@ rators of the railway customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a total of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum of the sum , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
damages were fixed on Friday afternoon , rail traffic on the south @-@ rail route could be guided without disabilities .
just ten personal data stayed in the morning , two of them related to the correspondence .
freight trains did not get rid of them , however , did not delay .
according to Ö@@ BB speaker , Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be replaced approximately 200 meters of upper lines .
ins@@ ulators and poles were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help IB@@ D ( infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ wel disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound for your digest@@ ive system like a night@@ mare .
but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , the symptoms of patients with anti @-@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ wel diseases .
the incur@@ able state , which affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States , caused mag@@ nets and ble@@ eding , recur@@ ring or blu@@ ff di@@ arr@@ he@@ els , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
during the person concerned , flesh and dairy products come to avoid their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an of proteins that promote the essential amino acid that promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ines .
the conduc@@ tive researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , stated that immun@@ cells in the gut pat@@ rol , to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes , which are hidden in food , do not enter into the body .
cells that are able to make inflamm@@ ations become balanced by cells , protecting the tolerance and protect the body without sensitive fabric .
if the equilibrium is too far in the direction of inflamm@@ ation , it may result in a infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ wel disease .
in experiments we found that a type of tolerance by the immun@@ cell in mice is pre@@ destined to carry out a particular bacter@@ ium in their in@@ wards .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an - one of the bricks of proteins - to resol@@ ve the appearance of the cells .
Professor Colonna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacter@@ ium - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illus reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the intest@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ al , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance , manufactured .
the more tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an mice had living in their food , the more they had taken care of that immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a few tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an nutrition is toler@@ ant , less infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory intest@@ inal mil@@ ie@@ us , when the same system is effective in humans .
the Post @-@ doctoral researcher Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan therefore sought out a kind of immun@@ o cell that had found that a group of study mice had such cells , but a other group of the same tribe , which was accommodated separately , this didn &apos;t .
it is thought that the difference between the intest@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ ds of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which usually live in the gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal tract .
the D@@ är@@ me of the mice were found DNA sequ@@ enz@@ es and were found in six bacter@@ ias , which were present in mice with the immune cells , but without it lack@@ ed with mice .
mice have been en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed in a ster@@ ile environment , so that a intest@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ ome was missing and they did not developed this kind of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria affect the immune system , the researchers L. reu@@ ter@@ i used to grow in a liquid and then carried small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells , which were isolated from mice .
the immune cells developed to the toler@@ ancing cells .
when the active component of the liquid was cleaned , it proved itself as a side @-@ product of tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an metabolism which is known as In@@ do@@ l @-@ 3 @-@ lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers have doubled the amount of tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an in the fo@@ dder of mice , the number of such cells were hal@@ ved around 50 percent , but if tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an@@ values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that people have the same toler@@ ancing cells such as mice , and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i protect against our stomach @-@ intest@@ ines .
it is not known whether tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an @-@ side @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i would like to develop cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an were found in humans with infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ wel disease .
she said , &quot; The evolution of this cells is probably something that we want to promote , because these cells control tend to the inner surface of the intest@@ ines .
the potential can lead high tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an@@ values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i to an extension of this population . &quot;
Jose Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; gen@@ ius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
in Manchester United has signed a &quot; gen@@ ius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut against S@@ amp@@ dor@@ ia on Wednesday evening .
the 40 million pounds signature from Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday and impressed as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira .
however , M@@ atic was excluded from the Prepar@@ ation Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes to make Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho in fact that he had to improve before the beginning of the Premier League season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a gen@@ ius in the manner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he think football , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him to be ready to be later than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ is and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u in the Avi@@ va Stadium , as Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho started his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season .
the Independent appeared in this week that Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho loved three other new comm@@ it@@ ments , but it insi@@ sted that the club has already carried out a &quot; fantastic work &quot; to meet three of its four priority ger@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added three of them , thanks to the association , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they have been four out of four , but they have given great effort . &quot;
Boeing . painted &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has made the Silhouette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle in Washington State , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in Michigan , and moved to the form of a Dream@@ liner over the United States , which are several thousand kilometres .
the action lasted 18 hours and one minute .
on the radar screen the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole was a cardio test for new engines .
Boeing had already done such advertising before .
so the number &quot; 787 &quot; and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky .
new low @-@ depth for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem
however , as the wind twi@@ sted : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD chief , the Socialist Prime Ministers always looked after elections with a certain worry to Berlin .
naked no trou@@ bl@@ esho@@ oting from the party headquarters , merely no counter @-@ wind from the covenant , thus loud the most important wish of voters .
since Martin Schulz has led the party , the fundamental change has changed .
since then , the employees from the Willy @-@ Brandt house with an increasing aston@@ ishment , the events in the SPD reg@@ ained state capit@@ als .
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not be described with counter @-@ ups .
there were low charges .
and one after another .
according to the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the CDU sets a general signal against co@@ al@@ itions of SPD and Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once more : red @-@ green can &apos;t be reliable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CDU @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber , the Ed@@ iting Network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the surprising fra@@ ction of an Green M@@ EPs took the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a severe crisis .
five months before the Parliament election , his red @-@ green coalition lost their superior votes to the opposition from CDU and F@@ DP .
the Green @-@ Federal Managing Director Michael Kell@@ ner was asked to return her mand@@ at on the Green Party of El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets , her mandate .
the transition to the CDU means a clear del@@ etion of voters .
El@@ ke T@@ ern must immediately return her mandate , &quot; said the Federal Managing Director and Ele@@ ctions of the Green Party executive ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this cannot be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new Hi@@ ob@@ s@@ pi@@ er &apos;s message was reached by the party headquarters when on Friday morning , a SPD campaign called &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Weil , SPD prime minister of Lower Saxony , according to the crossing of the green M@@ k El@@ ke T@@ empl@@ ars to the CDU without his own government multilingual .
it is the preliminary cli@@ max of a series of large and small cr@@ ises in SPD @-@ state associations .
and nobody knows what next is coming .
the mis@@ ery started with the unexpected defeat during the Saarland election in March .
a blue eye , no more , the com@@ ra@@ des shot down .
according to the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
it was then - and it was all very bad .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the s@@ wap , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ite &apos;s political party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the com@@ ra@@ des had been lab@@ oured in the weeks afterwards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then , when they had just exhau@@ sted their new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit of Hamburg came .
and with him the next r@@ ash came .
Mayor O@@ laf Sch@@ olz , the last @-@ strong SPD @-@ Land@@ esch@@ ef , lost its Nim@@ bus in that weekend , because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ bon harmon@@ ie while his city burned .
and because he went wrong in crisis communication so pretty everything that can be done wrong .
since then Sch@@ olz f@@ ights against his political survival .
now also Stephan Weil .
because of the VW @-@ exhaust aff@@ air and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been in criticism for a longer period .
Mi@@ ese surveys were added .
nevertheless , or perhaps just that , because over the past few weeks , Weil tried to implement the acc@@ ents in the last few weeks .
the taxation of the former Mayor of Hanover , which has to be completed in Berlin , is not hidden in the environment of Martin Schulz .
they let him grant him , as they spoke to a stabil@@ ization of the party .
now the exact opposite may occur .
there are no gu@@ ilt in this party , because there is no gu@@ ilt in the party .
and Schulz is not at all .
then , the com@@ rade is therefore ende@@ av@@ oured to keep the ranks closed down in their ranks .
her anger is aimed at the gre@@ enery , and here especially on the tr@@ il@@ ight par@@ liam@@ ent@@ ier@@ in T@@ li@@ fe@@ jack@@ ets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and demo@@ cra@@ y@@ able , such as Mr@@ s T@@ ern her own career of career over the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , chief of the parties in the SPD Bundestag &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. T@@ li@@ fe@@ jack@@ ets has not been elected to parliament for her person as a director , but on the state list of Lower Saxony , Lower Saxony .
the logical consequence would be that she returns to her mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD German Bundestag , compl@@ ained a &quot; non @-@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; the voters aged four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Weil to the Prime Minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who direc@@ ts the SPD &apos;s presidential candidate to the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the personal career of a future CDU MPs give the election results , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he asked to clari@@ fy the back@@ grounds .
I want to know if there was more or more announ@@ cing the CDU Niedersachsen .
convey@@ ors for town III
who would like to spend his coming home in the years can be received from the country soon .
in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of Ste@@ g Urban Development on Wednesday in sensation .
at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ in@@ dler gave a look back on the events until now .
since 1991 it has been teaching in sensation .
at that time , in the san@@ itation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the State of Baden @-@ Württemberg had taken two thirds of the funding amount .
in the renovation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the sub@@ sid@@ y was at least 60 per cent .
for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the current renov@@ ations are a &quot; success object &quot; - it is finally important to promote the interior development , and not only new construction areas .
on April 4 , we received the information from the government presi@@ dency in Karlsruhe to get information that there will be a remedi@@ ation area III .
the funding amount is 8@@ 33 333 euros , of which 500 000 euros from the country , the rest from the community sens@@ ations .
how does a san@@ itation work now ?
you will continue to investigate so Sch@@ in@@ dler , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are .
but it also plays an important role in the planned area of interest at all .
where necessary , the local borders could then post@@ p@@ one another .
the jet@@ ty occurred on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; cellar presented the content of the federal states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in whose framework the rehabilitation would be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the core of the program are the revol@@ ving of inner cities , improve the living and employment conditions and preservation and infrastructure .
the measures will take place on objects , which is based on the plot .
the rehabilitation area would then be specified as a statute .
the approval period for funding has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
however , until September this year , however , only once the inventory had been carried out , as part of them that will receive a questionn@@ aire to fill out a questionn@@ aire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in November or December as a result of the pro@@ positi@@ onal shot will be made , so that in the coming year with the renov@@ ations can be started . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann subsequently declared that each Commune must perform tests .
it is therefore to evaluate the urban@@ isation of abuse and decide when to be rehabil@@ it@@ ated and in what extent .
there will be a re@@ organisation in the land register for the respective plot .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again to sensation , and make a picture of the situation , she promised .
Got@@ zel stressed , a major success factor for the project was the participation of the hol@@ dings .
therefore , there will be questionn@@ aires who are sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be completed by the end of the summer holidays .
the yellow Quest@@ ionn@@ aire is the &quot; Building and basic navigation &quot; in which it is among others for the structural state and the inten@@ tional view .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in grey questionn@@ aire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; household and housing sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; can be made according to size , distribution and residents of a living room . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; operating sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is only necessary to fill in the building business rooms . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , in mind , Got@@ zel showed that a filled questionn@@ aire should not be accepted at the same time .
Moreover , new construction work must not be eligible .
Sch@@ in@@ dler still emphas@@ ised that distribution of funding after the &quot; wind @-@ design zip &quot; work - who first comes , m@@ ah@@ lt first .
you can &apos;t reserve any conveyor belt for later . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the conclusion , photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Local II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make the sen@@ sing a rehabilitation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British inventor uses a micro@@ chip to come with a hand movement in house and car
a British inventor is the first in the country , who is equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his office and even start with a hand movement .
Steven North@@ am , 33 , had the tiny chip between thum@@ bs and index fingers and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simpli@@ fy their lives with technology through its company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he has worked with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , a consult@@ ative an@@ a@@ esth@@ esia at the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the im@@ plant procedure is carried out according to medical standard .
the technology resem@@ bles a cats and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. North@@ am also wants to change the Cast@@ les at houses and cars that they are compatible with the chip , all for an additional cost of £ 300 per castle .
the married father of one has now integrated both at home and in his BMW Z4 technology , which starts when his hand is at the helm .
the advertising costs of the White House cost the tax@@ pay@@ er thousands
the decision of the White House , an Marine helicopter to fly to the South La@@ wn for an event , costs tax@@ pay@@ ers in the last month , costs tax@@ pay@@ ers to the data of the military , which have been delivered to the TI@@ ME magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on 17 July in the White House with American programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and executive officer of the White House made a tour of all 50 states .
in addition to a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a car from Wisconsin and a forkli@@ ft truck from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi was exhibited in Connecticut with a yacht from Ma@@ ine .
the military office of the White House asked the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ ment@@ arian order or FRA@@ GO , only 36 hours before Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 ) , the unit that is responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just wanted to know that you are aware of , because it is an ordinary event with a high visibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Com@@ man@@ de@@ ur of the H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 on the eve of the event , the deputy n@@ aval man@@ de@@ ur for aviation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message showed that the helicopter arrived on 17 July at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning to the South La@@ wn in the morning , and so long remained until the lawn was vac@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening .
note that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , due to the limitation of the service hours a second crew would be needed for return flight .
the original flight @-@ crew was during the helicopter while security personnel remained on the ground during the time on the floor .
the records presented from the TI@@ ME site was not clear if the second flight of flight was necessary .
the Hatch Act has been offered to use state property for political purposes .
data sets show that H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 has asked if the event could viol@@ ate the purpose .
&quot; a question that we asked if it was a violation of the Hatch acts and we were informed about that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander .
&quot; sounds as if you are closed , &quot; says the Deputy Commander .
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated by the White House as the official event and would not be covered by the Hatch Act .
but also official events have political super@@ tones .
at the event , the President gave a violation of reform of the health reform that was in the G@@ ange , and he prop@@ ag@@ ated the efforts to reduce government regulations .
the use of the plane , which is known as Marine One or Air Force One , is not a new phenomenon from polit@@ ically advant@@ age@@ ous purposes .
Pre@@ sidents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but their use only for a photo procedure is un@@ common .
Tr@@ ump led an investigation as the presidential plane in February in the background of his first Kamp@@ ag@@ nen@@ r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , Tax@@ i@@ Services , and his Twitter account is full of noti@@ fications relating to its predecessor using its predecessor .
&quot; the White House is inspired by the show &quot; Made in America &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the representative of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 cre@@ ws carry out training flights in the area around Washington and the South La@@ wn in order to reduce the U.S. President in the White House with precise measurements .
when Tr@@ ump was at the G20 summit in Germany in July , H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 led to the White House in 58 practice sessions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event was counted among the training requirement of the flight crew for the month , said an official . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; 11 hours a day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter units &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ presidential support &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said that the tax@@ pay@@ ers presented the last for no one of the other pro@@ ps that were presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky told that the company had not been involved to imagine a helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 hasn &apos;t added any bud@@ get@@ ary design@@ ations for the presidential and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ ari@@ fen of the US Ministry of Defense , the Do@@ D Group is responsible for the V@@ H @-@ 3D , however , 24.@@ 380 USD per flight hour .
record of the unit recorded flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House argu@@ ed that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter is far below that rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers are set up on the basis of app@@ eals purposes , it is highly qualified leader , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs which are included in the annual funds . &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the refund sets for Do@@ D does not contain the personnel costs , but take into account the costs for fuel , maintenance , and contract .
at that time , the former ex@@ chan@@ ger of the White House , S@@ ean Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; the idea is to present these week things , which will be made in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I go out that hundreds of people depend on people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think , as most Americans are all proud of helicop@@ ters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have ti@@ reless .
it is naturally reasonable , to raise it . &quot;
it was not clear if Tr@@ ump was inter@@ acted with the helicopter , when he entered his tour about the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire .
in the White House , Tr@@ ump on representatives of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and scher@@ sleben with the media about its own fleet of corporate products .
&quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; said the President , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

&quot; the offer is also valid for 35 @-@ hour supervision if children stay up to 14 o &apos;clock . &quot;
46 participation forces from 1st September Chef : they heat the delivered food , supplement them to salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ ters the meal individual , rinse the food from , rinse , rinse and clean the kitchen .
&quot; the employees are assigned to a c@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz .
the size - there are two groups as well as seven @-@ eng@@ ined facilities - decides on the hours of delivery .
&quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers are now part of the K@@ ita Team , &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much stronger and it is easier to implement educational concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this reason we are : healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; the children shall help to prepare food . &quot;
the direct connection between the kitchen and the team is meaning@@ ful .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a well @-@ known force in the K@@ ita , a person who tru@@ sts in them , and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continu@@ ity is important for children .
the pur@@ ge of the K@@ ita rooms - so far as the task of the kitchen chain - will be settled in the future of special cleaning staff .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen performance , has also the charm , which in the cost comparison between own ra@@ ining and foreign office for the city as the most economic energy , it is called by the Press Office .
and , even though 46 part @-@ time forces were new set .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so strong for around 750 people in the gu@@ ish sector . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
elections can be only representative when all members of the Society , including women who play a role , said the chief of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ s@@ om , reig@@ ning leader of the United Nations &apos;s mission , said that hundreds of women are arrested by the Council elections in the provinces . three women can learn for the role of Vice President and more than 30 per cent of the newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in an statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections can only be really representative and cre@@ dible if women are un@@ restricted and in all parts of your choice process .
Afghan elections for the Provin@@ cial Council and the Presi@@ dential elections will take place on April 5 .
the Taliban have published thre@@ ats against a selection process published with the transition from international host@@ ilities into a consult@@ ative role .
this year , elections for the first time will take the power peace@@ fully from a democr@@ atically elected government .
Hay@@ s@@ om said , a strong role for women to strengthen the democratic success of Afghanistan .
the Afghan independent elec@@ toral Commission reported that 1.2 million women have registered millions of registered voters registered in total .

G@@ MB @-@ concern about investments in the Mc@@ Vit@@ ie Factory in Glasgow
a union would like to reduce the commitment to plant managers of the Bis@@ c@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vit@@ ie via the long @-@ term commitment to the production plant in Glasgow .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company had taken hold of the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
more than 500 employees work in the work , which is created next to other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea K@@ ek@@ se .
Mc@@ V@@ ities owner Pl@@ adi@@ s said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that staff and trade union representatives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would learn when their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a letter to the company &apos;s branch of the company called the G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vit@@ ie &apos;s to express &quot; concerns relating to modernis@@ ation of production lines . &quot;
G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ Organ@@ izer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we cannot win clarity of the general needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross @-@ countries , aff@@ ecting our members .
generations of families have been working here and working forces strongly concentrate on local community and large area Glasgow , an important pillar for de@@ cent employment in an area with high unemployment and social dis@@ advant@@ age@@ ing .
therefore , under the perspective of work@@ places , the wage and prosper@@ ity , and in front of the background of Bre@@ x@@ it , the increasing cost of living and the chronic production process , the eastern end of Glasgow ur@@ gently need a floral production figure at Mc@@ Vit@@ ie . &quot;
a spokes@@ person for Pl@@ adi@@ s said : &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross won &apos;t get a letter of G@@ MB Scotland as yesterday , and the company will react directly to them since we estimate continuous commitment at employees and trade union representatives .
two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were discussed .
we discussed with the employees that we are like all companies working in an extremely competitive and un@@ certain economic climate , our business will be run - and that applies to all our business areas and locations - to be competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last years we invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , particularly in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are recogni@@ zing the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production facility and throughout . should our operational processes will change at the location , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
when the PS@@ G Barcelona warned against N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the page of La Liga is interested in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti .
Paris Saint @-@ Germain will not leave the persecution of N@@ ey@@ mar in her persecution of £ 189 million in order to resol@@ ve out his free pi@@ vot@@ al code , but have warned them in front of the world war three years ago ?
the sensational approach has crossed the transfer window in summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 @-@ Club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , while Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United past season .
after the completion of N@@ ey@@ mar to the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athletes in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is true via the way , as N@@ ey@@ mar has abandoned its way to outside , although a source near the Catal@@ ana executive board insi@@ sted that the club has always given its best to take care of it from Santos in 2013 to take care of it .
but the football world was warned about three years ago by the PS@@ G @-@ President before this view ?
when Manchester City was reported in 2014 in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , Nasser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for each association , who wanted to sign the best player from PS@@ G .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not concerned because they touch one of our players , then we will contact them in opposition , we will contact their players &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
but if they are trying to sign one of our players , this consequence will have consequences . &quot;
Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line , with the Spanish club express interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti in the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G made clear that they would not allow them to travel from Italy under any circumstances and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by having lost one of their prices for N@@ ey@@ mar .
sco@@ ot@@ ers thrown and damaged
in the night of Friday on Saturday an unknown do@@ er has thrown one in the Königs@@ felder Straße in front of the property number 30 , and so on the covering of the vehicle cash damage caused by more than 200 euros .
the Police Sch@@ ram@@ berg , phone 07@@ 422 / 27 01 @-@ 0 , asks for information .
an accident on the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese is looking for the police witness .
because it came to meet a car on his track , the driver had to depart for a VW Tour@@ an and touch@@ able the tail .
on Thursday evening , the 34 year old came from Reh@@ burg @-@ L@@ occ@@ um with his VW against 19.@@ 55 on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au in the direction of Le@@ ese .
in the area of the town of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a passenger car had to meet him on his lane , so that he was forced to turn right .
the Tour@@ an driver touch@@ able the gui@@ ding drivers .
damage on the passenger car was damaged .
the driver of the opposite car , a Mercedes Benz , had taken a truck and continued its journey without taking care of the traffic accident .
according to the in@@ dem@@ nity , it can be good that the citizen had not noticed the accident .
the police now asks witnesses of talks as well as the driver of urs@@ ing experience , under Tel . 0@@ 57@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 with the Com@@ miss@@ ariat in Stol@@ zen@@ au .
interview : &quot; Dom@@ estic atzen report re@@ lie@@ et Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ estic atzen report to the mis@@ use cases Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is the author and hist@@ ori@@ ans Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the Miss@@ men@@ ch@@ and@@ al at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ spar@@ atzen provides further discussions .
Christian Weis@@ sen@@ sel@@ ing , spokes@@ person of the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; explained by the former Reg@@ ens@@ burger Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of emer@@ gen@@ ated Pope Benedict XVI .
it would serve the presence of the Catholic Church , when Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deepest regre@@ t about their own sub@@ missions or the then false assessment of operations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican Law &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand of critic@@ ized that in the coverage of violence against the Dom@@ estic atzen station &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as regards the attacks in Regensburg , no one knows that it would have to be prevented and damage in the future ; but the &quot; degree of media manip@@ ulation , &quot; thus the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian , and member of the National Italian Bio@@ eth@@ ics Committee .
&quot; the custom@@ ary , the Catholic Church as a source of all plague is already part of the everyday experience and prepar@@ es the public opinion that for normal &quot; , writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia .
Prin@@ ted Gloria of Th@@ urn and Taxis said in an interview with Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk : &quot; we are happy to go on to the church and it &apos;s a folded Fres@@ sen . &quot;
in addition , it pointed out that in her adolesc@@ ence , they had been a completely normal ped@@ agog@@ ical means , &quot; to be done with happy children , as I was one to get ready . &quot;
they are un@@ fair , present standards for earlier decades , because the world have changed .
in connection with the reports about mis@@ use cases , Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was often observed .
he is entirely wrong , the author and hist@@ ori@@ ans Michael Hes@@ emann , who has written the &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; with R@@ atz@@ inger ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger into protection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says E@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he considers the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report , which was presented by the bish@@ op@@ ric of Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment lawyer Ulrich Weber ?
a total of 5@@ 47 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ spar@@ rows were sexually ab@@ ated between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s with high pl@@ au@@ sibility &quot; victims of survi@@ vors , 67 Dom@@ estic atzen .
in the final report it is entitled to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who has been active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; summar@@ izing that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases , forms of physical and psych@@ ic violence have been applied .
the punishment for pupils could also fall in case of high don@@ t@@ onal@@ ity .
however , contrary to many other words , many victims were estimated to ass@@ ess@@ ments the general humanity of R. R. and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence even positive memories . &quot;
in the interview , Hes@@ emann , why the final report on the mis@@ use sk@@ and@@ al at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger from his opinion .
Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; inci@@ dents of violence against shel@@ ters in the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ spar@@ atzen &quot; gives an conflic@@ ting picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
as a consequence , many students raise his &quot; humanity &quot; .
on the other hand , it is also known as Chol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which was built in the Ö@@ f@@ teren when a Dom@@ sp@@ atz was not a top performance .
how do you evaluate this final report as his biograph@@ er ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you read the trouble and read all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask themselves , why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is present at all .
with him , eight pages are dedicated , and he is clearly acquitted of any suspic@@ ion of the middle or co @-@ party in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the non@@ violence at the front of the school took place outside of its action .
you can try it out , of which too late or first notice of it cannot be taken enough .
the Dom@@ estic nas@@ ium , which he worked , was carried out by practically all respon@@ dents than - literally - &quot; salvation &quot; , &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
so the vast majority of his student Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is a very excellent witness , describes it as &quot; warm &quot; , &quot; very popular , &quot; as highly effective teachers who provided the guys regularly with cakes , cookies and bon@@ b@@ ons , and &quot; always surrounded by grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority is about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high ass ity , which led to wi@@ ches even by times .
that he cast not only with the chairs and cast the keys on the floor , but also ear@@ ne@@ sting males to the hair or ears , he gave himself up even years ago , and deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and exc@@ used for it .
however , to his honour must however be said that such educational methods in frag@@ ile time , in the 1960s and 1970s , were widespread , with parents such as teachers .
do you still know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think each of us was born in 1968 .
I have also experienced that in a world@@ ly school , a state gym@@ nas@@ ium .
compared to what it is in this report , namely , the terrible sexual abuse and the violence at the pre@@ school , the fre@@ il@@ ich Bag@@ at@@ ellen .
there one asks , whether it is not rather to do with his acquain@@ t@@ ance and his role as brother of Benedict XVI , many media have just dropped upon him .
on the Bavarian pop@@ e , many people have never understood him , still je@@ al@@ ous .
but the truth is : the report of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in the media a lot about mis@@ use in the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ estic atzen station was reported in the context of the report .
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is also placed in the final report with regard to sexual abuse as a load ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : very clearly no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual violence claims to have committed to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were inaugurated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never dar@@ ed to speak to my father or my mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the concern for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embar@@ r@@ assing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem in the En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment of sexual abuse was and , however , is that most victims of sh@@ am silent .
if they trusted not even parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then definitely not a ch@@ orus master , who would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators .
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ ade student R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in regard to the mis@@ use cases ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ ed student formulated this : &quot; concerning sexual abuse ... I see no case in which he had experienced ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) tim@@ ely in@@ sights and perpet@@ rators .
I think it ... also for really ab@@ sur@@ d , to accept that it is expected to cancel him ... Bu@@ ying in@@ sist@@ ence or clear@@ er , or also rather opened , as compared to their parents , interest instru@@ ctors , etc .
that one speaks with him about sex ... - un@@ th@@ ink@@ able . &quot;
thus the report about the very clear result : &quot; that an inv@@ ocation of the pupils and / or whose environment could not be entrusted to him , could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation . &quot;
as regards sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is free to help from any friends .
so , it cannot be prosec@@ uted to him , not prevented or brought him to the ad .
hence , there is no reason to bring his good name to these resist@@ ed crimes in connection , as it was unfortunately in some cases .
in the media a lot of &quot; violent processes &quot; was to be read at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ estic atzen station .
the former domain name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thrown in the report &quot; For@@ ks . &quot;
do he have to live with this ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the great problem that all in the coverage has been mixed and missed to a huge mel@@ ange from sexual abuse and non@@ violence and somewhere in the middle of the Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but that &apos;s exactly this is a mis@@ use of the report .
there is clean separately : between the primary school and the gym@@ nas@@ ium of the Dom@@ spar@@ atzen plant , between sexual abuse and non@@ violence , as well as we say , other desires .
furthermore , the report deals with inci@@ dents from the period since 1945 , so also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger won &apos;t ch@@ orus master .
the whole horri@@ ble test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases , in which boys of sa@@ dist@@ ic teachers were trained and dre@@ ad@@ ful , they all occurred on the Vor@@ wald school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where they really need to have disappeared states .
but with which Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys only on his face when they were already at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ ym@@ nas@@ ium .
on that was , as most of the most witnesses , the subject &quot; Pre@@ school &quot; tab@@ oo .
one was only happy to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; par@@ a@@ etic &quot; states .
what else was on the Dom@@ sp@@ ens@@ n@@ ym@@ nas@@ ium ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : since there were no discipline but no sa@@ dist@@ ic violence .
and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; many victims are victims of the R. estimates and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence even positive memories . &quot;
so , at the most , it remains th@@ aw@@ ed to have taken away .
however , in spite of all efforts , the report could only define two periods , in which it was reported by the states on the nur@@ ser@@ y .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he had just begun to establish and directed by their predecess@@ ors at a school which he didn &apos;t work and responsible , ( as the witness ) nothing wanted to hear , and then again around 1993 .
swal@@ lowed Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in front of the states consistently ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ ym@@ nas@@ ium , which the report was even re@@ produced .
in this way he pointed out this way , &quot; that at the Vor@@ schule continue to practice the test penalty . &quot;
already in view of the risk of negative pres@@ crip@@ tions , he ur@@ gent in@@ sights .
of course , this was of course at a time when legal clarity was also banned in Bavaria in Bavaria .
before that , they took themselves in a legal zone of Grau@@ zone , as every one of us know .
there was also difficult for him to estimate , where the affected could perhaps ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated or dramatic , and where really the allow@@ able border was exceeded .
but it can &apos;t say that he would have had sk@@ ill@@ ful .
that is simply not right .
only in 1980 , the test penalty was officially abolished in Bavaria in Bavaria .
Princess , Gloria of Th@@ urn and Taxis claimed that it was in@@ fair to apply this educational standards for the time of this educational time .
how do you see that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are talking about the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; snare of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus the danger , the past in today &apos;s moral scale standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there has been the prin@@ cess in law .
however , this does not apply to sexual abuse , who was ab@@ h@@ or for all times , and not for what was broken in the pre@@ school of resist@@ ors and violence against innocent children &apos;s children , that goes far beyond that time .
this is all aw@@ ful and I &apos;m glad that it is finally closed .
but at the same time I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means for discipline and punishment , therefore ear@@ melt and ears to go to hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
as a physical punishment , he has also been forbidden .
what is the picture of his Reg@@ ens@@ burger time has given me Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the talks with you for the book &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; ?
did the topic test penalty also per@@ taining to language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedict XVI , tells of his perspective , as the Dom@@ spar@@ atzen played only a part .
nevertheless , I did not fail to fail there a thor@@ ough reg@@ iment .
but this also has to be said , without these perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without the demand un@@ conditional discipline , it would probably not be possible to form the national culture ambassador of Europe and its musical tradition that were equal to the USA twice in the US ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with K@@ ek@@ sen and Bon@@ b@@ ons alone we do not make any great voc@@ alist and before each success , equal in which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ over@@ flow .
what kind of man do you have experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during talks on her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and in addition I learned Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well @-@ thought and always experienced a wonderful , hum@@ orous , fundamental , deep glorious and heart@@ felt man , of which one can not imagine that he could do something like a fly something .
I regularly get regular contact with how many former domain atzen still today , 23 years after his retirement , regularly contact him , visit him - he is almost blind - and he will treat him as a member of her family .
those who didn &apos;t forgive him until today , that he would be strictly speaking to them , so are clearly in the minority .
most of the Dom@@ spar@@ rows are than@@ k@@ ful to him today that he has enriched their lives and gave them the world of music .
and that he always has a good old teacher - a str@@ ingent father , dar@@ kened , it may be - but also a lov@@ able re@@ trac@@ tual man , that she still looked up today and honour them out .
and please , even very clearly : all that is done before him are educational methods that were in the agenda at that time .
we can be glad that we have long overcome this time .
but it is highly un@@ just , a man , only because he is highly promin@@ ently and has a more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al fall .
there is the evil intention behind it , just too obvious .
for the report , which was just published , reli@@ eves him .
now the level of interest would have acquired a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who had acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria , and perhaps in Germany probably nobody would know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ spar@@ atzen , finally in peace .
