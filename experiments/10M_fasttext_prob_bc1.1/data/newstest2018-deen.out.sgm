<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlases, an offer of the geoportals Bavaria in the State Government, are all others as currently - yet very revealing.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare it with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">This will be clear how cities and municipalities in the spread-area of the Munich Merkur has changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a Flicketry carpet, which one recognizes as such.</seg>

<seg id="21">The city has grown in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example is undersendling, which is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>

<seg id="50">Civil Code published Travel Guide for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Federation for Promoting Color has issued a warning for coloured people who are traveling to discriminate politics and racist attacks in the state of Missouri.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory Board of Missouri, which is to enter into force by August 28, 2017, calls for afro-American travellers, visitors and Missourianer, as a number of fragile incidents occur in the whole state and listed here," says it in the opinion of the group.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently passed law of Missouri, which makes people difficult to gain discrimination, as well as the prosecution authorities of the state, the undisproportionate in minority groups, the group that admit travellers, said the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have violations of civil rights that happen to people.</seg>
<seg id="55">They will be put together because of their skin colour, they are killed or killed, "said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard."</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group quoted incidents such as racist verging against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died in fragile circumstances beginning of the year after he had no more petrol during the journey through the state, accused of being accused of being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also shows a recent report by the Office of the General Attorney General of Missouri in which it is shown that black car drivers will be 75 percent more common in the state.</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware of and their families, friends and staff what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel.</seg>
<seg id="62">"people must be willing to bring it possible to bring their money or the relatives that they travel through the state."</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri stayed in the year 2015 in Hasselt, according to the latest figures from the FBI, which is the state in relation to the number of such injuries to the 16th place of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The traveller is also a reply to a new Missouri law that would make it difficult to complain about a company for residential or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberal Union (ACLU) had published traveling companions for Texas and Arizona, who pledged to undertake local prosecution authorities to replicate people for immigration, which will contribute to the view of ACLU to further reprofiling.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travelers are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but in the last time stakeholder groups have used the measure as a reaction to certain laws and trends within the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">Electric fence Project is Elementar</seg>
<seg id="68">The Frenchman Weidezaun project is a success project and will be continued in the next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU federal Parliament Peter White and Kordula Kovac took a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">At the grave yard of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Panerbacher met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann first opened insights into its operation, in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows, and also many young kittens and houses in five apartments.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" "" "Black Forest" "" "is the alternative marketable for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">There is only regional trains to the table of the holiday guests.</seg>
<seg id="74">As he is also BLHV-Chairman of Fischerbach, he also called the electric fence as "Elementar important."</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot generate steep surfaces on this type.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green area care for much work, a lot must be treated with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have here with the terms and to fight with the topography," "" "stressed by Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he adopted the elternal operation and accepted this without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if he lead no biomode.</seg>
<seg id="79">For mayor Thomas Schneider was clear: "the Commune has recognized the importance of the electric fence and is glad through the Leader" Leader. "</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare the farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">You hope that the view of the surfaces could be stopped for a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have, are people who work in agriculture and make thoughts on how they continue to continue," "" "stressed the Mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">The farmers are often involved in criticism of the promotion.</seg>
<seg id="84">In 2013, a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The open space amounts to 40 hectares, which may not be attened for at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Of the total cost of 71 500 euros, half of the leader was promoted by leader, a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fischerbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus, the farmers stayed 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16,2 kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," said Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">Kordula Kovac stressed: "you are doing a really good job, without farmers and rural women do not go."</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "Peter White" "" "stand firm:" "" "here are the best food produced." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The Regional Court of Baden-Württemberg (LPR) Baden-Wuerttemberg enables the state funding of women's fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is to open the Schwarzwald.</seg>
<seg id="93">The presence of one of the LPR has been used.</seg>
<seg id="94">Furthermore, the inoccluding area should not be traceable (staffection above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by the conception.</seg>
<seg id="95">A total of eight participants with 24 parcels, which would like to build a 16-kilometre fence.</seg>
<seg id="96">The open space represents 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is now taking the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest character of a regime change is when they start to attack statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans estimate these likewise as every other - therefore the sorrowful fall of Saddam Hussein's death on the Firdos place in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, knew certainly what he did when he had a symbolic axe in a heat dispute using Jim Acosta from CNN on the proposals of the president to drastic decline of legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller did not handle the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boaters and liberty imitators have had gelynchronous when he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he took their significance, and in particular the importance that it was attributed to the famous poem by Emma Lazarus, 17 years after the completion of the monument, his base was added.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller carcosta wrote: "I don't want to go on a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem, which you relate to which was added later, and is not part of the original statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is objectively correct but as he formulated it himself, it is not really around history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemplative words of Lazarus, the only one in which a state does not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your webs, your poor, and your oppressed masses, which is to breathe freely, and the drop of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time in which the "despersion" was better to see on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he clearly did that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural conflict: it is indeed a conflict around the meaning of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and their friends who used to place their words after their death on the basis - did very good that they had completed a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicans by introducing them in an unused classic picture depicting the female embodiment of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no more abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself another name: mother of the Exilant.</seg>
<seg id="116">The compound with the picture is a brilliant feminist Coup and a devastating attack on the American Nativity.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people wanted to change from the right wing for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great cry of Rush Limbgh, a kind of John the Baptist to the coming of Trump, argued 2010 that the Statue of Liberty wants to introduce the American flame into the world: "Lady Liberty continues.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should wear the chackel of the freedom of the United States in the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch does not have the way to shine in the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Pretty unusual is Limbaugh here on something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The importance of the statue is quite and even a matter of the point of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The big imaginative act of Lazarus was in it to see how they were troubled, but hopeful people after long and often terrible travel on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "it is in the true sense to see the world from perspective of people who seek refuge and improve their lives." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue says to them the words of hope and of the welcome which they must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And this is of course not the perspective, the Miller and trump ever want to recognize.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch does not shine the way, but the hatred that is the only source of power.</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black is Scottish Members of the United Kingdom</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle is reminiscent of a time when only two shallots belonged to the United Kingdom team.</seg>
<seg id="130">The performance director of athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-strong contingent of Scotland in the world championship race will make a massive contribution to the team. "</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes selected for London in 2017 which starts on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">Black believes that "Scotland has become something special" in Scotland, "and the athletics of the United Kingdom must learn from it.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "we welcome it, and we try to understand, and we will continue to figure out until we'll find it," "" "said Black." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">"I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athlets think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medallized medals, among them Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - which will compete against Sir Mo Farah at the 5.000 m distance while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team to team-capitals.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilabh is rather modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Their capitals talk was incredible, "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a series of athletes, whether they were Scottish, or wherever they live or exercise, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and the genuine feeling that Eilidh was completely destroyed, were great. "</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth of Silver medallists who will compete for the fifth World Championships at the 400 m Hurdles, says that it is "incredible" that 16 Scots are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">In Scotland, the best total number of athletes at the World Championships was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The Middle distances of Muir runs on this road and placed in five British and two European records in the past year.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, which runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman to win the victory at the British team Trials and the Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle is reminiscent of their first world championships, when the only other Scotsman was in Team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">The crest capitals says that she is "enormously proud" to the fact that many of their countrymen did not only belong to the team, but in some cases also with the medals and at the Finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"" "" "" "so special is what team member states that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was anyway a great honour, but to know that my team-mates have voted for me and have chosen me, making it something very special for me," "" "she added." ""</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I am very proud of all the villi who belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as established athletes, athletes, who want to climb on Pots.</seg>
<seg id="155">What are my speech given as a surrender?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think it went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I only noted that in this situation we are very happy because we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to put on this home-support and to benefit that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go out and compete, and it's just a great atmosphere there outside. "</seg>
<seg id="160">Block from critics on Facebook: do not work for a public office if you do not wear the heat of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad news.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers beat him because of the inpolicy up to its political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He impecte in the critique, safe.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not put his reviews on silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">For the year 1783, Washington said: "the free speech can be taken away - and, stupid and silent, we will be led as sheep for the battles."</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to Larry Hogan who has to work on it, more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberal Union has accused him at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The staff of the Governors dismissed the lawsuit as frivol, and the online commentary was full of a counter-reaction with "Na," and?. "</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's just Facebook," said many people.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when it is a guy like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is astonishing.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest consent of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is no reactionary Hitzhead.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a solid hand at the leadership of his state and strict adherence to principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very sent to use Facebook as a primary means to connect to his electors and to debutt his hair on his side after chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the blocking of persons that come to the site of the Governors - which is a public forum, which is officially called and of employees who are paid by public tax-Dollars - unnecessarily and eventually dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan spokesperson Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the governor and argued that the blocking of comments may not be more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of uncontrolled or split or hasserted people that are online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The Post said with some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders, a teacher, a businessman and a priest, no part.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectful and not profited.</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor cited the Bible in his post office and appealed to Hogan Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Legal attorney at Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hasserted, but she asked for Hasselt.</seg>
<seg id="186">"" "" "" "I'm sorry that I was disappointed that there was no reaction on Hasselt and other current news," "" "wrote in the commentary area of the news programme" "" "The Post." ""</seg>
<seg id="187">"" "" "" "I do not give this idea even if a number of people participate in the same subject, then they will be regarded as a so-called collectiques and not as a large group of people concerned." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="188">What the employees of the Governors as "concentrating spam attack," another would probably call "intercession".</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by using a critic or deleted a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in previous time when you have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical conducts and burn or demonstrating or demonstrating demonstrators and to silence.</seg>
<seg id="191">But exactly that happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public officials, which criticised that he has implies Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is laminated by Twitter users, who were blocked from his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question was last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County concealed the First Aextment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris, in Alexandria when she joined a Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit to ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">It should not be so heavy.</seg>
<seg id="198">At time of time, the time of an affordable port had a similar effect as the internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers, between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter, beat on his leadership.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even at that time Washington had an anonymous force.</seg>
<seg id="201">The people who used pseudonyms as "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius and" Portius "wrote all the letters to newspapers, which made Washington's decisions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitions, which criticises his position on the Treaty of Amity, the trade and shipping with the United Kingdom, prevail against the historical documents, which were collected by the George Washington project by the Online Papers of the George Washington Project.</seg>
<seg id="203">But he didn't have them to silence.</seg>

<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Perhaps John F. Kelly can do it really.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If yes, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">POLITICO claims that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to restrict the information flow to President trump - including the reports of the news media - in hope, chief of a more uniform course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of Reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, in his first working day with senior employees, he introduced a main problem in President Donald Trumps White House which he repairing: bad information that come into the hands of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly said the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in correspondence - because the President would meet better decisions, if he would receive good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Waist diagnostic power makes sense but others tries to count trump by controlling its media facilities.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps has been back for decades - and now, where he is at the White House, his TV advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"if candidate trump was offended due to unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of places that were convinced," said the former electoral consultant Sam Nunberg in February against POLITICO.</seg>
<seg id="1399">Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keep Trumps Twitter custom under control, according to six former counseling officers to ensure that his personal media consumption involves a constant praise."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps Twitter is ever "under control," is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps this campaigns realize something, what we don't know that Trumps Tweets could not contain more combustible numbers without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will never know something about the tweets that will not broadcast trump.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his employees create him some times, trouble from him, then their effort was worth it.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has to prevent it consistently calls for trump controverses.</seg>
<seg id="1406">A part of the problem exists that people together in a white house, that places out of competing parties, will always try to present their own agenda, which may encourage their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">POLITICO - Established with this history - reported on the preference for strategic reasons to investigate strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example that was described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump officials predict that Trump can react to negative press classes, especially those with damage leaks, and that he may find out how they come out.</seg>
<seg id="1410">Exactly this happened at the end of February, when someone claims to be a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet Provokateur Charles C. Johnson who accused the source of Deputy Prime Minister Katie Walsh, "the source behind a cluster to be" at the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was exiled permanently on Twitter due to lack of evidence, or that he sold no concrete evidence in the past, or that he has given false allegations in the past.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump reading the article and began to ask collaborating on Walsh. "</seg>

<seg id="1414">How did this work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tried three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove itself as an effective Manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and its advisors still strive to influence.</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia Affair: U.S. Special Representative uses Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">In Russia's affair to US President Donald Trump, a so-called Grand Jury was appointed by US President Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1481">In the past few weeks, the committee started working on appeal, wrote the "Wall Street Journal" on appeal.</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper evaluates the step as a sign that Mueller has widened its investigations and intensified.</seg>
<seg id="1483">CNN reported, there is already the first preinvitations of the committee in connection with a meeting between Trumps eldest son and a Russian attorney.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Us secret services accused the Kremlin in order to have targeted specifically in the presidential campaign in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller is examined whether they spoke between Trumps electoral team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the focus of the investigations, there are several men standing in election campaign as a consultant of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to reports, Mueller also took more and more trumps private and business environment among the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="1488">The Washington Post, "wrote some weeks ago that the special stemler Trump personally placed in the centre and taught the allegation whether the President may hinder justice in the course of the affair.</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jurys is to verify that this proofs may prove and decide whether the indictment should be imposed.</seg>
<seg id="1490">In addition, Grand jurys are also called ancled.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Mostly they will be switched on when it is bigger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure will always be closed behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">In addition, the board can also be switched on by the Public Prosecutor to recharge persons under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the CNN channels, pre-invitations were exhibited, which turned to meet the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian attorney.</seg>
<seg id="1495">People who were involved in the meeting were invited to a statement, named it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">You should also prepare documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">In addition to Trump Jr. there were also Trumps consultants and son-law Jared Kushner as well as his destruction leader Paul Manafort with the conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Right-wing remarks on Thursday evening in the U.S. television that the entry show that Mueller is not intimidated in his work, and that it should be necessary, acting quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">However, it must not be hot, that the Grand Jury is switched on at the end to decide on the collection of an accusation.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Nevertheless, the composition of the committee was the start of a new phase in the research and a new reason for the concern for President Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the midst of the new revelation, the President on Thursday evening took an address in West Virginia to present Russia's affair as a campaign of his political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="1502">"Russia's history is a complete invention," said Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The theme of the Democrats give the Democrats a way to feel good, "because they have nothing else to talk about which they can talk."</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special adviser Ty Cobb explained in a position he knows nothing from the composition of a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">But this work also usually work in case, he stressed.</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House advocates all measures to accelerated the work of the special thing on "faire" mode.</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI chief Apostle James Comey said that it was not determined against the President.</seg>
<seg id="1508">I have no reason to accept that something has changed in this statement.</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller was only used after Trump Comey fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Because of these reties, we have become drosled to Trump, he who want to hinder justice.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Comey said in June before a Senate Committee, Trump gave him a setting of investigations against the then national security consultant Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president stands under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">After representation of U.S. media, the White House was gathered against the Special Representative and his employees.</seg>
<seg id="1514">That dissolved speculations about whether Trump mueller are discharged.</seg>
<seg id="1515">Unlike in the Watergate-Affair, such as in the Watergate-Affaires who later returned to Richard Nixon, Mueller may be hired as a position in which he could be fired at the infirmament of the President of the Ministry of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1516">Several transformers of both parties want to prevent such a step.</seg>

<seg id="1521">The stretch over a trillion tonnes of heavy and 5800 square kilometres of Koloss shortly after the North and will probably take two, three years until it was melted.</seg>

<seg id="1524">In what extent of climate change played a role in the demolition of the ice, is unclear according to research data.</seg>
<seg id="1525">However, since approximately 30 years there is a series of unusual collings in the region, the U.S. Research Centre for snow and ice (NSIDC) writes in a fact.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, that can be joined together with global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The broken Koloss had so far been a part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Shelfeis floating on the sea and is fed by big glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It is always growing on the sea and breaks off regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the top of the antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this scraper was the balance of waxing and breaks up some years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete chelis to fall there, writes AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">It disagree that the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is in danger, because the front edge have never been withdrawn so far as currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Moreover, the iron plate can be cut below, and can be broken up in case of a key station.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg is elevated above sea level, as they swim on the water and pushed the ice as much water as it descends after the melt.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the cheer leads to the glaciers directly to the sea and to flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase the sea level, but only in a low degree, the British research project writes to observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI data, the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth biggest archefeis of Antarctica with almost 50 000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 metres thick, on the front edge of the open sea about 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it regularly breaks off.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"" "" "" "even though it is a natural bow, and no direct link to climate change is aware, the ice plate comes into a endangered position," "" "said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University." ""</seg>
<seg id="1542">"that is the most important retreat since the beginning of records," he confirmed also.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Among scientists are controversial whether the Larsen-C-Schelfeis now grow back or long, and possibly together, his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will last decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even if this researcher do not lead the demolition of this gigantic iron gs not to change climate change, they are very many ice hunters of the Antarctic Peninsula in recent decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long clockface of Antarctica extends towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to data from the research program British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The increase in temperature was contributed to the decline.</seg>

<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert of the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effective, because the plant has been exposed to climate change impacts over the past few years, which had much less rain in the spring and much more.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has impact on the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a little Zikade, a microbacterium that transmits dwarf-mates, and with very dry weather there is very many of them. "</seg>

<seg id="1803">Eric Chaisse said: "instead of very long vegetable intake with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, UNTERENTWICKELTE and either missing or weakened.</seg>
<seg id="1804">So we have less parts with essential oil. "</seg>

<seg id="1809">The Assassination of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The employees of Weekly Riodoce meet in Wednesdays to check out their plans for the coverage of the youngest chaos in the state of Sinaloa through the organized crime, corrupt civil servants and unceable drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But in that day, in the shadow of her own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-ranking journalists discuss what you feel safe: they are to take their children with the office, which were the aim of an attack with granite, or to leave them at home in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Safety experts have written three words to a table on the front of the room: opponent, neutrals, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Please ask the reporter, name for any column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and abdominal properties.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug gugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected to stand on the base list of the government or the cartels, a catalog of Crime, which make the chaos of Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no break from the violence, and during all the country the corpses are frequent, and more journalists took office: at least 25, since then president Enrique Pena Nieto opened his office in December 2012. 589 have been on attacks and threats under Bundesprotection and until now there were at least seven dead in seven countries.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is their editors and their inspiration of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the greatest mistakes is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist, Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1820">His lack is found deep, although its presence is present - a large photo by Valdez that shows his middle-finger with the word "Justice ', depends on the facade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts that show its smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop will take place less than two months after his death, and reporters discuss their shared topics, trauma, her nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although it was established in 2010, a songator has been created in order to edit the cases of journalists, according to the Committee for the Protection of journalists, only two criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with the most thousands of Morden, who are linked each year with drug trafficking and organic crimes, the murderers of journalists are only taken in court.</seg>
<seg id="1824">With Riodoce they still exist to treat the violence of Sinaloa, although they are unnecessary, and although the terrain is still missing.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting on the discussion of safety is little benefit, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to spend my time in this workshop," says he.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we do not know why we know all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce at the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was forced by two men. he was forced into him from his car and was suppressed about 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper - the "12th river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The Sagittarius was gone away in his car and damaged it near.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown-up children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the topic Valdez there are virtually nothing worth silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzmans arrest in January and extradition in the United States in January, Sinaloa became one of the bloody battling fields of the country, as the rival factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people will be shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of embellished, two-story mouse clicks for drug could be bigger than many houses for the Living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget about a minute that there is a state of "tranquility ', if only one card control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the fault that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstanding have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First published in February the publication of an interview recorded with Damo Lopez, a leader of a rival antellfish fractions in the war with Guzmans's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have offended the sons, suspected the members bought every copy of the edition as soon as they had been delivered to newspaper kioske.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second fault was in that Valdez was not forced to force, after confiscation of another newspaper, which had published the same story to leave the country at his own safety.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues said that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He was in 2003 as an experienced reporter for Noroeste, when he completed five colleagues in the founding of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars in holdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," it was impossible to operate journalism without ceasing the robotic problem "" "," said Bojorquez. "" "</seg>
<seg id="1847">At the time, the newspaper served a reputation due to the courageous and honourable coverage, and sales and advertising.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters could publish it hard, hard tread investigations without fear of the censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication that they could read stories that nobody else did.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the formation of Riodoce she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot prize" for its coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of journalists in the persecution of the Mexican drug history, where they also led them.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave himself up that he had been afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I would like to live on" he said about the time of the CPJ award.</seg>
<seg id="1853">Drug trade in Sinaloa "is a way of life," said he in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.</seg>
<seg id="1854">"they must take over the task of being working as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">I would not be asked: "what have you done so many dead, why did you not say what went out?"</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun-bird that could curse like a harbour workers, the friend, generously with hugs and counseling, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always bear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit on the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love for the routine his destruction?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced them to ask her own concerns about how to do their work on the best and to stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"" "" "" "they don't like to deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret start and landing" "" "to move drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-adhesive and self-maintenance.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust its own instincite.</seg>
<seg id="1866">When it is wrong, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The trouble is, the publisher of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said "odour a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing with Javier has happened."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, such as he and others say, in Sinaloa did not apply anymore - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a poisonous mixture of lucrative dirt, weak institutions and corrupt government officials.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the staff of Riodoce met for security training, there were suddenly no mobile phones allowed. days earlier this spyware that is sold solely on governments to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Two policemen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce into a four-storey building in Culiacan area.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the shear, some of the reporters, whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen who called the governor itself as not trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months ago, since the reporter had gone into the mountain landscape where the drugs are facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the edition of this week, Riodoce has attached to three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">It was the assassination of the brother of the former famous Boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had a posthumous to the state spending, focused on the home town of the Governors.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group called in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the State Lawyer, a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about it, who was kidnapped, or how it happened, so was careful when it was time to write that everyone in the city know, that the restaurant is a favourite locally accepted by drug authorities and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporters learned from public records that the restaurant has been registered under the name of a policy that has belonged to the regresale Institutional Revolution Party (pri), which ruled all political levels almost the whole century.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Several pri governors were accused of corruption due to high-time cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">In Villarreal asked Reporter, to write about previous incidents in this locality, among them one who escaped a son of "El Chapo" Guzman.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months ago, the readers had seen the column by Valdez as the best informed source about the abduction.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"" "" "" "we did know what happened," "" "said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname" "" "El FLACO" "" "because of his slim body nature." ""</seg>
<seg id="1885">"all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">The office of Valdez was dedicated to the storage room for signs and stickers, dedicated to the Morde of journalists, because the staff have never become something of what they never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Replica Miriam Ramirez snapped a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration for a further journalist for the office of the State Lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed, in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burned body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests that it is his.</seg>
<seg id="1890">In the whole country, journalists have been stronger, having organized the "SOS Press" organized in organized protests and buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1891">On that day the director Bojorquez was gone into Washington and tries to collect international support for the justice in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">In a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to express journalists and bring them to them because they have said the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has since then asked that she is divided by the government, because she worried that her rage has violated her objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez had repeated that journalists in Mexico of organized crimes committed by the government officials and a united society. "</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book "Narco-journalism," he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug, but also on orders of politicians and security forces, who were organized with organized crimes under a blanket.</seg>
<seg id="1896">The media "Articulo 19" media group has assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials.</seg>

<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic, the Hispante plant frescos is the best preserved fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn Radio as he was born on 21 March 2011 in Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the North of Alberta, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He met something, which seemed out of the surrounding rock out of the square, and decided to look closer.</seg>
<seg id="1932">Fossil, which was discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work, the final result is ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"" "" "" "if you need only a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that it slipped," "" "said the main autor Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is visible." ""</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it is written in the science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs individuals - the mona Lisa of the dinosaur."</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have found that this plant frescos, although it is covered with a armor and a wall tank resembles probably from meat vorced dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The strong dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide themselves before smokers, and used a detachant technology that is used as counterfattaching, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have been allowed to mix oneself better into its surroundings and to avoid enemies, say experts, which indicates that it was threatened by major dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the Nodosaurier family has made headlines for the first time in May and is now at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now named the wild animal, and it was called Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7.000 hours to cover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the patterns and the form of sheds on his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the contemplation, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, meaning that the top of the creation was darker than their underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the fragmentation is common, the results are surprising as the size of Borealopelta exceeds that of today living animals.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaurs were chased by plenty of pressure through flesh vorous dinosaurs, that the evolution of the confrontation was favoured as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals that use the fragmentation - think of deer, zebras or belt - are much smaller and violate as prey, what signalized that this Nodosauans was exposed to a real struggle for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong smoked behavior on a massive, strongly geared dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaurs smokers must have been the Cretaceous period," said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1948">Chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaurs was red-brown.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to examine the animal on critics over his life, including its preserved gut, to find out what it eaten as its last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaurs died when he died, into a river, and was driven into the sea, where he sank into the sea back.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time Alberta was as warm as southern florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much further landwards than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with condensed skin, but also available in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the beast," said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1953">"the result is that the animal is today almost the same in the early Cretaceous period.</seg>
<seg id="1954">You don't need to use a lot of fantasy to reconstruct it. if you're only a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that he is in sleep. "</seg>
<seg id="1955">The chalk time was a time when huge thermal diodes, carnivorous dinosaur, which stood on two legs, the earth was pierced.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, millions years after Borealopelta, the Georgian dinosaurs was chased from some of his fury ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the Acrocanoosaurus, a 38 feet (11,5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters.</seg>

<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken by up to their nucleus.</seg>

<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After landing at 23 o'clock she took her 6-year-old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would drive on the next morning to Ferguson.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?," in the cinemas from the 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a history of survival and dissipation, the strength and resistance of resistance, which consists of the perspective of human beings living in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">When Ferrell, with her daughter, carried a flower dress, and a right crown, carried out on Ferguson, the two had a conversation, that they had countless times before this morning, "about the black experience and the black condition."</seg>

<seg id="2047">It has to know and see it and be mounted in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">It must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also the various layers of the black experience and the black constitution, and what we must do to free to rid ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even if I have Happiness to give her an experience, in whom they do not have experienced racism in person, it is not different than the next black women child.</seg>

<seg id="2051">The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was at South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which became a camps on the possible non-indictment by Chief Apostle Darren Wilson.</seg>

<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It is all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later, Ferrell met on Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said she and her cinematographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to record only "what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">A question came from Ferrell to the meaning: "will you be documented or tries to find a story that you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">This skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often by white - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">As folayan recently declared in an interview: "we heard that people who were born in Ferguson and grew up, they did not centred their voices, and we wanted to do it different."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had already worked together with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area that is known for his activism around Too-occupants.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His commitment brought Ferrell the project closer, along with six other natives followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Browns.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"" "" "" "this documentary is not any one who speaks for us or talking with us. we speak," "" "said Davis." ""</seg>
<seg id="2066">"" "" "" "this was the main thing for me as these people are represented, because then I will be represented." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2067">The goal was not to focus on ferreling experience - in order to show that it is in motion "not about a Messiah-guide, but for a community that come together," said Folayan - she proved to be the most obvious participant in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">In folly, documents of "Whose Streets?" surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrells Life, as she loves and marries her wife.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed as they saw the finished product for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "but I understood that there must be certain vulnerability in this work and in the deceiving of black people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrells's history is the role of the black gay women in the wider Black Lives movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement that have marked the film "BlacklivesMatter" in 2012, influenced by the "BlacklivesMatter" film in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, pregnant women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether," said Ferrell, "and therefore we fight continuously at different fronts.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Black, pregnant women must bear the main load of everything. "</seg>
<seg id="2075">Folayan agree that "the movement really is kept by the black women and a lot of black women."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"" "however, it insisted that" "" "this is not a fast type of action," "" "when Ferrell was chosen because of their identity in the heart of the film." ""</seg>

<seg id="2080">In the meantime, the news-cameras in Ferguson have been long gone, but the racial between the congregation and the police continue to continue.</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on parole for 2 ½ years because of the blocking of a highway near a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the social atmosphere of the area that she calls her home: "a chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Nevertheless she clashed herself on a song and she felt at this memory since three years ago in Ferguson on the road.</seg>

<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre on the Süver of the pedestrian zone are split since the first presentation in 2009 the population in fears and opponents.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The topic is hardly possible.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"" "on our Facebook page" "" "People's and Bitburg" "" "the topic is discussed." ""</seg>
<seg id="2093">While the one-bit gallery say: "that would be a dream" (Nicole Schausten), coming from the other side: "doesn't need man" (Siggi Baking) or quite simply: "slander!" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While the fears make sure that a gallery attracts more clients to the city, the other businesses will benefit, fear the opponents that the pedestrian zone paused.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the premises where the farmhouse is located in which 13 direct dealers will offer its products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">The construction work will be concluded with the beginning of the construction work.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The Gallery Macher want to integrate a Markthalle in the new building - namely a Beda place with the possibility to sitting outside.</seg>

<seg id="2109">You can see how many shops have been empty, some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But since there is not even a regular weekly market, it is the more important that at least the market place will remain at least.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Because after all, the goods offered there are fresh, most are offered directly from the producer and is inexpensive.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you see, store shops in a shopping centre can be rented only by larger companies, because the rental rentals are often not portable for retailers.</seg>

<seg id="2114">Wolf trafficking: "a shopping mall with a market hall does not fit for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all: where should the farmer market place during the construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old EDEKA would be the solution - even if the bit gallery is actually coming.</seg>

<seg id="2124">An appropriate similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the room of Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are visible - white, black and brown, which are almost imperceptible - that depend on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tuples and Haarlem, which were sent to you by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent out the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former intelligence analytics put in a 35-year sentence, after performing diplomatic messages about the website of WikiLeaks.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on 2 August, A Becoming Resemblance (An appropriate similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">It is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline took their expertise in technology, computer science and art, whose condemnation was converted by Barack Obama, when he was only three days in his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithmic analysis of the DNA that could look like with these genomic data, such as someone could not only look to the molability of DNA data - the many ways, as they can be interpreted and the infirmness Determinism of these interpretations - but also to the identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born when Bradley Edward was born, but already since their puberty over the identification as a woman, was condemned in 2013 because of 20 accusations against the law law, computer and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">By the prison, her painting was suppressed, so much that it only gave a single photo - a grain-white, black-white selfie, in the maning is clearly sitting on a driver seat and a platinblonde perig carries - with which it was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of their 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In this, the artist portraits of strange artifacts like cigarette blink and chewing gum, producing the DNA from the waste to produce a picture that could look like these people.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," said Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And it could not be visited for that time and could not be photographed, therefore you took contact with Chelsea, and asked them if they wanted to do a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her prisoned Muse have been carried out by the Brieffel who ruled several letters during the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">She even proclaimed a comic "supporter Images," which he predicts a future in which the President Chelyish Judgment would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama had actually just a few days after the book was published, Mannings ended up after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome kind of lucky meeting.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also now in the opening of the exhibition something deep and Starkes, since Donald Trump leads a war against informant of governmental forces and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to resolve the rigid sphere, which he should fix further.</seg>
<seg id="2142">As a Dewey-Hagborg after the weird timing of all these things, she said that "things would happen from a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In one on the wall of the gallery, maning with their oversized signature among them (the "i" in their family name is provided with a heart) an end of "automatic deformation, whose foundation sex, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is its mitochondrial DNA sequence - an thousandths of Cs and Gs and As, in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg trusted by the inclusion of the 200 letters (or Nustotide after the highly developed scientific Lexicon of the artist), as amazingly, at least in biological respects, we all are.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people are hopefully say that our genome is not therefore cares, who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective them are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works of 2007, microious Memories, also is to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, hence the 30 of these stories."</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition is kept in an own room, is one side of the Comic-Novelle mentioned above.</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning, as she appears with a free-hand-trap in the United States from the United States as King Kong.</seg>

<seg id="2226">Previously, if a clerk wanted to report a problem, he had to find one telephone number or email for the corporate headquarters, a formal appeal and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often an enlightening and uncomfortable experience, James Vitrano, Ruby TUESDAYS General Counsel, who said, there was no good opportunity to track the complaints from employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Well, since the company Convertible, you can have problems that were previously hidden by executives that were hidden in offices in cities or states - like discrimination, harassment, or unobtruer practitioners.</seg>

<seg id="2390">Yes, indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robot are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for Responsible Robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we have to begin doing their ascent.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye colour of the robot, its shape of the nipple and type of fingers.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"" "" "" "the people are fun, but the company provide a lot of it, and we will be able to see them much more frequently," "" "said Mr Sharkey at the release of his new report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern Sexpuppen have developed by their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with aware of human reactions that can be achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can adjust its robot also according to its beliefs "and choose everything from the eye color of the robot on the form of breast warning to type or color of his fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it is still worrying, as many robots have the "personalities" that would look like a stepping woman progressive.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexpuppen have developed to robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot makes it possible for example to adapt their robots to the properties that it will be appealing as for example.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is still the True Companion developed Roxxxy Gold sex robot with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah," which gives the impression of relays and "Wild Wendy" with a "adventurous" personality. "</seg>

<seg id="2404">In the course of the day they also have their keys - quite like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">It can be tired, be fixed on conversation or she can be "in mood."</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many beastounding aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least, because they really replace real human relationships - but the indemnity of rape, if one goes a step on frigid (called here: contradily) Farrah, troubled one most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website true True Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) could have a vibrator, why can men then have Roxxxy?" it is called on the website.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not only a Fetish or just another sexual playing.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their birth and their increasing refinement show a slightly darker and deepening in our culture, on a retreat from the ideal solution of the sexes go to sex with subjugation as an optional encore.</seg>

<seg id="2412">But what goes out of the boundary zones may be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time, in which we live, very instructive.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not weird or bad until them the free market gives permission to them.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlapping, that these highly developed sex robots at a time occur in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide, in which there are a president in the White House which thus geared, women attacked sexual assault.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The abhornmost aspect of the TV series' The handmaid's Tale '(' The report of the handmaid ') are not the graphic images that acts inseparable bodies and the cast eyes, but as realistic this vision.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a jump but at the moment this will not feel like a big jump.</seg>

<seg id="2424">Trumps great achievement?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney for the incomprehension of healthy human dignity</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a bypassing of the Trump era, that the political circuits that have polarised the US voters, also split families in small format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around the Christmas and harvest in the United States there were newspapers with advice about how to get to the horror from Trump selectable relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We tighten all supposedly to help our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less notted, the power of Trumps has been together to accommodate families.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I chose this because my cousin, a left-directional slide show that lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Republicans in our family, who visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me that the unity could have a mighty effect against a joint enemy.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, everyone who knows it, including the Republican family, who struggled for decades because of politics, suddenly and quite strange on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">In order to be the dining table there is certainly a good thing, but it falls in a further context that this also produces significant risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left hand was strengthened by trump, but the unoxifying effect of his Presidency has the power to move all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">If we speak of "normalization" and trump, we refer to the grazing possibility that we will not stumble with our bib of one day.</seg>
<seg id="2436">There is, however, there is another long-term scenario in which Trump republicans of the right wing "normalizes," which suddenly appeared in comparison to his standards suddenly as incomprehenation of suspected.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Now I find myself from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's new version of the backward - the dog on the Autodach, which saw 14% income tax (but at least did we know how his tax return) - both occur in the comparison to Trump in fact a very mild criminal offences.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must be spiritually healthy to qualify as unmeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin in the city was, we brought our children to the Carousel at Central Park, the largest of the Carousel's park department, and the best three dollars that you can spend in the city if you do not need caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are crumy and the animals are turning round to look full of fear over their own shoulders - most findest and climate-speaking music gives this a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings are grown old, the Skylines become familiar to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city will not be justified.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Five and thirty years later, and I'm still not over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss Cottage - the subjects-Pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not counted - but a large roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">The Central Park-Karussell is still a strange magical experience since here two-year-old, one 11-year-old and two women in the 40-year-old and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have to evaluate the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one has asked later.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced to rate my "Experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house on the corner of my street, it is the same, plus the option to balance with a 15% tip of drinking - this to buy something about the shop table.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This does not only lead to a slowdown of what actually should be a neutral exchange, but also practising pressure on the server to enter personality to a situation in which is no necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store apologized, while I fade the experience to rich my credit card with five stars.</seg>

<seg id="2452">Pistorius was convicted of murder of prosecuting the prosecuting attorneys for murder in murder.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early morning of Valentine's 2013, giving them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria on her.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed that he behaved his girlfriend for a nightly inpenetration, hidden in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecuting attorneys have announced their intention to submit this time against the six-year sentence by Pistorius Appell, of which they say that they would be opaque.</seg>
<seg id="2456">The National Prosecutor authorities stated that it will be appealed to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the verdict could be heard this year.</seg>
<seg id="2457">Pistorius is danger that his sentence is increased to 15 years when the prosecutors are successful.</seg>

<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, the symptoms of patients with anti-inflammatory bowel diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable state, which affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States, caused magnets and bleeding, recurring or bluff diarrheels, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">During the person concerned, flesh and dairy products come to avoid their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins that promote the essential amino acid that promote a tolerant intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The conductive researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, stated that immuncells in the gut patrol, to ensure that harmful microbes, which are hidden in food, do not enter into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are able to make inflammations become balanced by cells, protecting the tolerance and protect the body without sensitive fabric.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the equilibrium is too far in the direction of inflammation, it may result in a inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments we found that a type of tolerance by the immuncell in mice is predestined to carry out a particular bacterium in their inwards.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the bricks of proteins - to resolve the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterium - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbial, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance, manufactured.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan mice had living in their food, the more they had taken care of that immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a few tryptophan nutrition is tolerant, less inflammatory intestinal milieus, when the same system is effective in humans.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The Post-doctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan therefore sought out a kind of immuno cell that had found that a group of study mice had such cells, but a other group of the same tribe, which was accommodated separately, this didn't.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It is thought that the difference between the intestinal microbids of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which usually live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The Därme of the mice were found DNA sequenzes and were found in six bacterias, which were present in mice with the immune cells, but without it lacked with mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice have been encircled in a sterile environment, so that a intestinal microbiome was missing and they did not developed this kind of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers L. reuteri used to grow in a liquid and then carried small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells, which were isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the tolerancing cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component of the liquid was cleaned, it proved itself as a side-product of tryptophan metabolism which is known as Indol-3-lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers have doubled the amount of tryptophan in the fodder of mice, the number of such cells were halved around 50 percent, but if tryptophanvalues were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerancing cells such as mice, and that most of us L. reuteri protect against our stomach-intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan-side-products from L. reuteri would like to develop cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in humans with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">She said, "The evolution of this cells is probably something that we want to promote, because these cells control tend to the inner surface of the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2603">The potential can lead high tryptophanvalues in the presence of L. reuteri to an extension of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domestic atzen report relieet Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domestic atzen report to the misuse cases Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This is the author and historians Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the Missmenchandal at the Regensburger Domsparatzen provides further discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weissenseling, spokesperson of the reform movement "We are Church," explained by the former Regensburger Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of emergenated Pope Benedict XVI.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the presence of the Catholic Church, when Müller and Ratzinger would express their deepest regret about their own submissions or the then false assessment of operations.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "the Vatican Law" "" "Osservatore Romano" "" "on the other hand of criticized that in the coverage of violence against the Domestic atzen station" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">As regards the attacks in Regensburg, no one knows that it would have to be prevented and damage in the future; but the "degree of media manipulation," thus the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian, and member of the National Italian Bioethics Committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the customary, the Catholic Church as a source of all plague is already part of the everyday experience and prepares the public opinion that for normal", writes Scaraffia.</seg>
<seg id="2897">Printed Gloria of Thurn and Taxis said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: "we are happy to go on to the church and it's a folded Fressen."</seg>
<seg id="2898">In addition, it pointed out that in her adolescence, they had been a completely normal pedagogical means, "to be done with happy children, as I was one to get ready."</seg>
<seg id="2899">They are unfair, present standards for earlier decades, because the world have changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports about misuse cases, Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger was often observed.</seg>
<seg id="2901">He is entirely wrong, the author and historians Michael Hesemann, who has written the "My brother of Pope" with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I have to take Georg Ratzinger into protection," "" "says Eemann," "" "for all this had nothing to do with him," "" "he considers the results of the final report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report, which was presented by the bishopric of Regensburg with the Enlightenment lawyer Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 Regensburger Domsparrows were sexually abated between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s with high plausibility "victims of survivors, 67 Domestic atzen.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report it is entitled to Georg Ratzinger, who has been active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "summarizing that by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases, forms of physical and psychic violence have been applied.</seg>
<seg id="2906">The punishment for pupils could also fall in case of high dontonality.</seg>
<seg id="2907">However, contrary to many other words, many victims were estimated to assessments the general humanity of R. R. and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence even positive memories. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann, why the final report on the misuse skandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger from his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of violence against shelters in the Regensburger Domsparatzen" gives an conflicting picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">As a consequence, many students raise his "humanity".</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, it is also known as Choleriker and perfectionist, which was built in the Öfteren when a Domspatz was not a top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you read the trouble and read all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask themselves, why the name Georg Ratzinger is present at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">With him, eight pages are dedicated, and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of the middle or co-party in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The nonviolence at the front of the school took place outside of its action.</seg>
<seg id="2916">You can try it out, of which too late or first notice of it cannot be taken enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The Domestic nasium, which he worked, was carried out by practically all respondents than - literally - "salvation", "heaven" and "better world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">So the vast majority of his student Georg Ratzinger is a very excellent witness, describes it as "warm", "very popular," as highly effective teachers who provided the guys regularly with cakes, cookies and bonbons, and "always surrounded by grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority is about his perfectionism and its high ass ity, which led to wiches even by times.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he cast not only with the chairs and cast the keys on the floor, but also earnesting males to the hair or ears, he gave himself up even years ago, and deeply regretted and excused for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">However, to his honour must however be said that such educational methods in fragile time, in the 1960s and 1970s, were widespread, with parents such as teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think each of us was born in 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I have also experienced that in a worldly school, a state gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what it is in this report, namely, the terrible sexual abuse and the violence at the preschool, the freilich Bagatellen.</seg>
<seg id="2926">There one asks, whether it is not rather to do with his acquaintance and his role as brother of Benedict XVI, many media have just dropped upon him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">On the Bavarian pope, many people have never understood him, still jealous.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report of Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media a lot about misuse in the Regensburger Domestic atzen station was reported in the context of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger is also placed in the final report with regard to sexual abuse as a load?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: very clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual violence claims to have committed to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never dared to speak to my father or my mother," "" "said one of the concern for the others," "" "It was all very embarrassing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in the Enlightenment of sexual abuse was and, however, is that most victims of sham silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they trusted not even parents and siblings, then definitely not a chorus master, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspade student Ratzinger's role in regard to the misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questioned student formulated this: "concerning sexual abuse... I see no case in which he had experienced (Georg Ratzinger) timely insights and perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I think it... also for really absurd, to accept that it is expected to cancel him... Buying insistence or clearer, or also rather opened, as compared to their parents, interest instructors, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">Thus the report about the very clear result: "that an invocation of the pupils and / or whose environment could not be entrusted to him, could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation."</seg>
<seg id="2942">As regards sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is free to help from any friends.</seg>
<seg id="2943">So, it cannot be prosecuted to him, not prevented or brought him to the ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Hence, there is no reason to bring his good name to these resisted crimes in connection, as it was unfortunately in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media a lot of "violent processes" was to be read at the Regensburger Domestic atzen station.</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former domain name Georg Ratzinger is thrown in the report "Forks."</seg>
<seg id="2947">Do he have to live with this?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the great problem that all in the coverage has been mixed and missed to a huge melange from sexual abuse and nonviolence and somewhere in the middle of the Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But that's exactly this is a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There is clean separately: between the primary school and the gymnasium of the Domsparatzen plant, between sexual abuse and nonviolence, as well as we say, other desires.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Furthermore, the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945, so also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger won't chorus master.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole horrible test pedagogy, the cases, in which boys of sadistic teachers were trained and dreadful, they all occurred on the Vorwald school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where they really need to have disappeared states.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with which Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys only on his face when they were already at the Domspatzymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On that was, as most of the most witnesses, the subject "Preschool" taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paraetic" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What else was on the Domspensnymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: since there were no discipline but no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report comes to the conclusion that "many victims are victims of the R. estimates and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence even positive memories."</seg>
<seg id="2959">So, at the most, it remains thawed to have taken away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">However, in spite of all efforts, the report could only define two periods, in which it was reported by the states on the nursery.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he had just begun to establish and directed by their predecessors at a school which he didn't work and responsible, (as the witness) nothing wanted to hear, and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Swallowed Georg Ratzinger in front of the states consistently?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzymnasium, which the report was even reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2964">In this way he pointed out this way, "that at the Vorschule continue to practice the test penalty."</seg>
<seg id="2965">Already in view of the risk of negative prescriptions, he urgent insights.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Of course, this was of course at a time when legal clarity was also banned in Bavaria in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they took themselves in a legal zone of Grauzone, as every one of us know.</seg>
<seg id="2968">There was also difficult for him to estimate, where the affected could perhaps exaggerated or dramatic, and where really the allowable border was exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But it can't say that he would have had skillful.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That is simply not right.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980, the test penalty was officially abolished in Bavaria in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was infair to apply this educational standards for the time of this educational time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"" "Michael Hesemann:" "" "we are talking about the" "" "snare of Anachronism," "" "thus the danger, the past in today's moral scale standards." ""</seg>
<seg id="2975">There has been the princess in law.</seg>
<seg id="2976">However, this does not apply to sexual abuse, who was abhor for all times, and not for what was broken in the preschool of resistors and violence against innocent children's children, that goes far beyond that time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all awful and I'm glad that it is finally closed.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means for discipline and punishment, therefore earmelt and ears to go to hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">As a physical punishment, he has also been forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="2981">What is the picture of his Regensburger time has given me Georg Ratzinger in the talks with you for the book "My brother of the Pope"?</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the topic test penalty also pertaining to language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, tells of his perspective, as the Domsparatzen played only a part.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I did not fail to fail there a thorough regiment.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But this also has to be said, without these perfectionism, without the demand unconditional discipline, it would probably not be possible to form the national culture ambassador of Europe and its musical tradition that were equal to the USA twice in the US (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With Keksen and Bonbons alone we do not make any great vocalist and before each success, equal in which area, but always discipline, passion and self-overflow.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of man do you have experienced Georg Ratzinger during talks on her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and in addition I learned Georg Ratzinger really well-thought and always experienced a wonderful, humorous, fundamental, deep glorious and heartfelt man, of which one can not imagine that he could do something like a fly something.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly get regular contact with how many former domain atzen still today, 23 years after his retirement, regularly contact him, visit him - he is almost blind - and he will treat him as a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who didn't forgive him until today, that he would be strictly speaking to them, so are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the Domsparrows are thankful to him today that he has enriched their lives and gave them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he always has a good old teacher - a stringent father, darkened, it may be - but also a lovable retractual man, that she still looked up today and honour them out.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, even very clearly: all that is done before him are educational methods that were in the agenda at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have long overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly unjust, a man, only because he is highly prominently and has a more prominent brother to make a medial fall.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intention behind it, just too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report, which was just published, relieves him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the level of interest would have acquired a 93-year-old man who had acquired great merits and without the outside of Bavaria, and perhaps in Germany probably nobody would know the Regensburger Domsparatzen, finally in peace.</seg>
