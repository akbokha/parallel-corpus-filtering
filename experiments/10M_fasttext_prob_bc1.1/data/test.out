Jenni@@ fer An@@ ist@@ on must not always be perfect or successful .
that has made the Hollywood star in an interview un@@ ab@@ usive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will always be plug@@ ged in drawers or remove from the outside of the label , which have a little to do with me and the reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t have the wish to be perfect and successful . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ est@@ ly , these things are more simple to me . &quot;

gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger obt@@ ains the pyramid of pil@@ es
his experiences on the horse are over@@ looked .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger visited the beach with some colleagues a bit di@@ version with a ride on the beach .
it was a premiere for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old .
CH@@ IO : &quot; Golden Sport@@ pil@@ es &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes , the horses remembered her opening evening , they hunt back home in the fast g@@ opp .
a kilometer at this speed , I have been afraid .
&quot; it was no good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and therefore the horse career ends again .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer ever - 101 tournament victories - again close to horses .
he left his family over the line of AL@@ RV with his family , on a horse f@@ itt@@ eth not to photo @-@ so@@ cks .
the first time in Aachen was the first time in Aachen .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports assistance reached the man from An@@ hausen in the context of a small Gala to the Golden Sport@@ pil@@ es .
in distin@@ ctions it is not lacking to the lik@@ able sport@@ s@@ men .
Federal Cross of Cross , Silber@@ nes Lor@@ be@@ er@@ blatt , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the Year ...
even the British Queen has already ad@@ owed it .
long is the 18th winner of the pyramid of pil@@ es .
in Aachen , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this distinction is very much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because she is not only for sporty successes , but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lan@@ ger has been supporting the offspring since decades .
and so he also gave the prize money of 25.000 Euro to the same .
with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ fold U.S. Master winner was induc@@ ted on Saturday in the &quot; Hall of Fame of the German Sports . &quot;
the visits include the athletes of Hart@@ wig G@@ ien@@ ger , who Turner Eber@@ hard G@@ ien@@ ger , the ru@@ of Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ru@@ do@@ ka Frank Wien@@ eke , the Spr@@ mb@@ iter Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ ously of the hand@@ craft of all Erhard .
many of these sports were come to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the lively Society moved to the Spring@@ stadium where the Lav@@ az@@ za price ran .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger held gap to the big animals .
Clin@@ cke and Tr@@ um@@ ps Economic Policy in Compar@@ ison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and prevent the trade agreement T@@ TP - which want to be Clinton as well as Tr@@ ump .
however , the two US Presi@@ dential applicants is based on the tax and energy policy as well as in a basic question .
differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton are a fundamental , more philosoph@@ ical difference being destroyed .
he , about the role of the state .
tr@@ ump wants to hold the doubt rather small and war@@ ns , as the state of the economy could harm - with taxes and regul@@ ators .
Clinton wool to control the economy and regul@@ ate the economy , he says .
he himself would be entirely different , claims Tr@@ ump .
he will make them massi@@ vely , and he makes himself strong tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies .
Clinton says : the state has given certain tasks , he has announced opportunities to open and needs money .
therefore , taxes for the rich would increase , says it .
Inter@@ est@@ ingly , both very close to the topic of infrastructure .
in the final one must be invested , Tr@@ ump and Clinton had almost wor@@ t@@ ted .
the democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are rejected by the state @-@ rit@@ ual Te@@ apart@@ y @-@ wing of the Republi@@ can stri@@ kt .
so on dr@@ unk@@ y , so many internal discussions could come .
the differences in energy and climate policies are significant .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and drive the coal production in the USA again .
in now protected areas , oil extraction should also be possible to termin@@ ate the climate agreement in Paris .
in contrast , Clinton wants to expand renewable energies with its investment program : &quot; a country will create the super@@ power of clean energies and create millions jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want that we are . &quot;
but not only in the infrastructure - even at international trade agreements the two competitors are not too far from each other .
T@@ PP , the Real @-@ fish trade agreements , do not want to sign .
at the same time , both the United States don &apos;t want to isol@@ ate the U.S. by international trade - but simply protect American jobs .
these should then be paid even better , for Clinton .
the present minimum wage of 7,@@ 25 US dollars is a hungry wage .
it wants to increase it to $ 15 per hour .
what Tr@@ ump wants to do this question is not clear : once he says : the minimum wage has to be , then he says he may not be changed .
but the big discussion of the coming months is likely to develop in order to develop the two camps .
on the one hand , Tr@@ ump , who wants to re@@ load the economy and citizens to boost growth .
his critics stop him , so the bud@@ get@@ ary deficit would only be greater .
on the other hand , Clinton who want to ask at least of the rich , that they will pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution .
escape : &quot; any wing@@ ed woman has experience with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence is among women who flee to almost daily life .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mat@@ ised .
a house offers refuge .
four women sitting in a large kitchen .
each has a baby , which is at most one year old .
one has laid their young son in the arm .
he gu@@ esses with big eyes ne@@ ug@@ ig in the room .
his mother rigid on the table top .
until they noticed that it is observed .
she sm@@ iled short and kissed the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until one speaks with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is a division manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a sponsor for social aid offers in Bavaria , and deals with the subject of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are pl@@ ough@@ ing .
they live in the Munich north in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alised accommodations for all participating women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs made up the institution together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women &apos;s Office .
it has been officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men are not there - also not as visitors .
the exception is a watch@@ man before the door .
&quot; it is not ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated to say : every woman who comes here has done on her escape experiences with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
&quot; men flee because of wars , because they are polit@@ ically persecuted because of them death or death , because they send their families a hop@@ eful to Europe , &quot; she tells them .
among women there were many reasons for the run : &quot; many steal themselves secretly for the flight , because they don &apos;t see any other way . &quot;
in her hom@@ eland they have made experience with sexual violence , forced labor@@ ator@@ ial , slavery or forced pro@@ st@@ itution .
that drives them off .
on the run goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , t@@ ug@@ boat for a bottle of water require sexual action is no rarity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who think that the end as soon as they come into Germany , ir@@ re , tells B@@ ahr .
too , all women among refugee families would have often regarded as min@@ e@@ as and worse and worse .
this means that around 90 percent of women who live in the accommodation of the Munich north are trau@@ mat@@ ised in the accommodation .
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot;
many women are there such that they say nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t trust , open on the earth , because the shame is too great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often did not get to help you need more accommodation only for them , calls B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven regional governments are responsible for the establishment of refugees .
on the question whether they were similar to a similar project , as in Munich in her state of jurisdiction , they reply some with no .
in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz region and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there are not something in voluntary governments .
even in Schw@@ aben , women alone are not accommodated alone , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press Officer of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central fran@@ ken , there are only two floors or their own houses for all women and their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations only for women .
the &quot; Rights of Women and Gender Equality &quot; in the European Parliament is calling for women to be accommodated separately from men .
in a study published for the committee , it is said : &quot; it is very important that men and women are separated separately . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack the privacy or are accommodated together , it can come to - persistent - violence against women &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the shower room should be separately accessible and for women easily accessible , is in the study .
how much the women of this protection needs to be felt , you can read on the And@@ alu@@ cía who gives it to the house in Munich .
&quot; since it has been spoken that there are a long waiting list , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
one could make a second house .
assistant doctors strike : demands according to new work@@ horse measures
assistant representatives of the assistant doctors have called their union to appro@@ ve new work@@ horse measures in their disp@@ utes regarding a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has requested its entire advice from the beginning of September more work@@ horse measures .
the J@@ DC said that it had promised ministers to worry about the concerns relating to the treaty .
assistance and medical assist@@ ants have voted in July on the re@@ jection of a contract which was agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members who was published on Thursday evening on Twitter , the President of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court , that the government of &quot; be@@ wil@@ ful quiet@@ ly &quot; would have stayed in problems that the contract was rejected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In view of what the J@@ DC executive committee voted to completely re@@ ject the proposed new contract and concerns the official re @-@ negotiations for all their wor@@ ries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board has provided a formal application for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to make a running program es@@ cal@@ ating work measures that begins at the beginning of September .
the disp@@ utes resulted in that assistant doctors strike in six times a strike in the history of N@@ HS .
according to the election of the BM@@ A Assist@@ enz@@ berg , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , according to the vote of the agreed contract conditions that were recommended by the BM@@ A .
he distributed BM@@ A members during the meetings that took place before the vote by 54@@ .000 assist@@ ants and medical students , that the contract is to be beneficial and adopted .
after the vote , the Minister for Health , Jeremy Hunt , was forced to force the contract for doctors in England .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended a crisis .
the leader of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce their hands and make an official end of the eight months in continuous war of the words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin took his Turkish counter@@ player in the gilded Hall of the St. Petersburg Palace , I can &apos;t for@@ bid that Ankara wants to destroy these reconciliation in most .
there was the manual , yes .
but Putin was nar@@ row@@ ly worked nar@@ row@@ ly and he radi@@ ated warmth , even for his repe@@ ating conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Recep Tayyip Erd@@ og@@ an , on the other hand , repeatedly spoke about his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a report whole five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not count it anymore .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to its old level before the crisis , but can still improve even better .
the next day a newspaper described that Erd@@ og@@ an would have thought so would never happen to happen .
his enthusiasm seemed to indicate the opposite of my enthusiasm .
but one of Putin &apos;s dar@@ ing , sustainable cooling showed that the State of Russia had not forgotten .
rather , the crisis of crisis was the first , what he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory remarks : the surplus of a Russian fighter aircraft at the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow reaction to the time was w@@ ut@@ ri@@ fied .
Putin shared Putin and accused Ankara to be in the back .
that was even bigger , as it was committed by a promised friend .
the Vet@@ rop@@ es will be difficult , if not even impossible to become impossible .
the public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state @-@ controlled media led a sharp , un@@ restricted attack against Ankara .
once it seemed to be , the Turks would bear the iniquity for everything .
the serious civil servants , that Erd@@ og@@ ans have benef@@ ited their own family from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria , which will be controlled from the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he fought this v@@ eh@@ ement .
but in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look back to the front .
finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the President Erd@@ og@@ an the exc@@ use that he wanted to hear .
Russia could book a kind victory .
to Ankara lie the benefits of an arm@@ ist@@ ure clearly on the hand .
Erd@@ og@@ an needs to be primarily associated with all friends who he can get after last month at a failed coup d &apos;@@ etat of his ministry .
repeated terror attacks on Turkey also have sh@@ aken him .
but there are also economic mot@@ ives .
Russian sanctions are hard hit Turkey - particularly the ban of charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number is gone by almost 90 % .
in Russia , travel companies and charter companies are facilit@@ ated when the flights resum@@ ed .
they count on a subsequent ais@@ le storm of the Mediterranean .
this week projected cable @-@ cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural exports are allowed again .
a report in Ve@@ demo@@ st@@ i formulated it as follows : &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes for long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is ra@@ ged in the West as it was the response to the attempted power of power than a weak answer .
for this purpose , the continued Gro@@ ll pass through the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ ke is to take advantage of the cool mood and to reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West .
in Ankara , Russian president won security in Ankara with security that he asked the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat support for the chosen state of state .
that is well pleased for Moscow , a self @-@ intelli@@ gi@@ bility , which himself has a pro@@ sitting fear of Reg@@ im@@ e@@ ering .
the summit meeting in this gl@@ itter@@ ing palace made by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey , one how it seems to introduce a analy@@ st , &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; : two countries , which are cast off from the West and feel po@@ or@@ ly treated .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still big differences between the two still big differences .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave the role as a peace @-@ point , but to support Russia and Turkey .
it could be recording that after almost three hours of first discussions on the press conference , they said that they had not taken the topic once .
the President of Turkey agreed to answer a question concerning their differences , while Putin decided to emphas@@ ize this .
there is no clear con@@ sens@@ us about it , where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after the months of open host@@ ilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster as NATO member of the Russian Battle jet , it is certainly better that the two state heads talk at least once again .
Royal Bank of Scotland for clients outside Scotland Not available anymore
according to the Bank &apos;s Chairman of the Bank , R@@ BS will only be reduced to a back@@ office roll .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will not be available for customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand joined the Bank &apos;s global amb@@ itions .
the bank has since dist@@ anced since then eight years ago almost collap@@ sed and had to be saved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at this time brand new &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have used to protect other end consumer brands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she supported the international sports with millions of pounds at sponsor@@ ship , from the Six Nations Rug@@ by to Wimbledon champion Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now it has decided to make more national brands in the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , de@@ centr@@ alised headquarters and IP@@ West will change to Nat@@ West .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other , smaller brands for the private customer business that will get more significance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ WAN was inter@@ viewed during a guided tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Sh@@ ire .
he joined the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the RS@@ B brand will be at our investment brand as well as to the brand , among which our employees are busy , since we will now be able to become a bank of brands . &quot;
when the bank became a global brand , R@@ BS became the global brand .
I say now that we have no global targets but local goals .
each of these stamps will stand in their own communities for something completely different and our employees will work among these brands with the customer .
R@@ BS already said that it will not continue his Six Nations Spon@@ sor@@ ing and will continue to increase the perc@@ us@@ ability of various brands in his sport Spon@@ sor@@ ing .
&quot; it is time for us to develop the brands of brands , for how do we focus on inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Board of Directors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ n@@ ical three years ago , when we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands .
but with our work , focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can re@@ build these brands again , therefore I think that the time has come .

Russian Putin breath@@ es Ivan@@ ov &apos;s Chief of Staff .
Russian President Vladimir Putin was released as unexpected as Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was many years part of the close confi@@ denti@@ ality of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed special minister for environmental and transport .
in an opinion of the Kre@@ m@@ lin it reads that Putin was arranged for the release of Ivan@@ ov@@ s by his duties as Chairman of the Russian Pre@@ sidi@@ um Administration . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who joined Ivan@@ ov@@ s in 2012 , was appointed to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is former diplom@@ at .
born in 1972 in the Estonian capital of Tallinn , he graduated from the renowned Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy .
on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin it is called ( in Russian ) that he later referred the log of log and Staff Manager of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it is the most important role of the government to assist your activity as a state Secretary with Legislative Decree and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov has asked to leave his post and recommended to V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
persu@@ ade the sm@@ iling faces ?
this step has been mysteri@@ ously Moscow .
Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov was a long time in the close of Vladimir Putin and works as he works for the Soviet Intelligence Service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast@@ ed on TV , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff came to his own request .
but despite the exac@@ erb@@ ation of the cameras , just a few of them are convinced - especially in front of the parliamentary elections .
so here is the result of a kind of power dispute ?
this is no one knows .
but the official claim - that a man who once again proved to be a potential President , who would like to guide the Russian environmental policy - fell to big sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism .
in his remarks on Putin , cited on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , Ivan@@ ov , &quot; it &apos;s true that I asked you in early 2012 in a conversation to tell me this very complicated post - one could almost say - to use this post for four years .
as it states , I have been chairman of the Russian chair@@ person for four years and eight months .
Ivan@@ ov resum@@ ed the post in December 2011 .
previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin &apos;s former member of the State Security Service of K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , he was appointed the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed chairman of his deputy .
when Putin came to power he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people , which he trusted in the most .
it was assumed that Ivan@@ ov could be President of Russia to Putin &apos;s second term , as a third term of Putin would have cast off to the Constitution .
but this item was taken by another opponent , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin was Prime Minister before he became President of three and a half years later .
British Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gibson , after moving producers
Gibson was involved last month at a physical meditation on a set of series in Los Angeles .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , which are producing the series , announced its cancellation in a common position .
Gibson , who played Special Agent against Aaron Hot@@ ch@@ ner , decided on Thursday before the announcement of its cancellation publicly .
on the set there came to artistic differences and differences of opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I regre@@ t the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for details , such as the character of Gib@@ sons , which follows a team of FB@@ I agents , will be published , according to the opinion of ABC studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , are expected to be published at a later date .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who played in the Sit@@ Com Dhar@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , was the first season of the series in 2005 with it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love Min@@ ds and I have hin@@ ted the last twelve years my whole heart blood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gibson in a message published on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;

puzzles for fish that landed in Garden in Ban@@ ff
a inhabitants of Ban@@ ff required for the identification of fish help , who appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain think it could act with the 75 fishes around Sand@@ a@@ ale that were sp@@ r@@ ins@@ ed by a fountain .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published on Per@@ is@@ cope a video of the spectac@@ le in hope that someone could throw any light on the publication of the two inches long fishes .
Queens@@ land Cross@@ ing : bridge now connected to Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project should be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the North @-@ deck of the Queens@@ land Cross@@ ings with the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - what means the bridge is connected to Fi@@ fe .
it is the first of four closing of the &quot; covers , &quot; which is the completion of the three towers of the bridge .
the bridge of Fi@@ fe is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tonnes .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 be@@ v@@ ings .
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project should be completed by May 2017 .
the Minister for Economic Affairs K@@ eit@@ h Brown is a visit to the building site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment at the construction of the Queens@@ land Cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all the witnesses of a engineering drawing of a truly ep@@ ic dimensions in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the flow between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a hei@@ g@@ le activity which require extremely precise tolerances for fit .
altogether , almost 79 % of the total bridge de@@ cks in their place and the last stretch of Dec@@ ks gets a concrete finish for the deck , which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted up on the bridge to its place .
Michael Martin , project leader of For@@ th Cross@@ ing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure is a significant milestone in each bridge project .
with this fantastic project , the closure of the cutting @-@ proof high and deep construction represents .
following the installation of the last street cover and the connection with the north tower deck , we had to close the even existing gap on the north or land .
this was reached by pulling bridge 700 millimeter south by pulling bridge .
this was a massive and very sensitive activity .
massive , since the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 metres long , weighs approx . 6.000 tons and had to be drawn up at an ascent of about 3 % .
the tolerances that the team is worked , tiny - on each side it was only a few millimeters .
lu@@ ck@@ ily everything went very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men have &quot; happiness still alive &quot;
three men have become &quot; happiness still alive , &quot; after they were thrown out of their fishing boat from Angl@@ es@@ ey .
the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI rescue station struck down on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T Alarm , after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay .
the three men had difficulties to swim while their boat came from their own power .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we looked like the boat in its proximity to turned and set us the worst in front of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leader of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds ble@@ w the boat already out of their range until we left to water , &quot; he added .
two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man were exhau@@ sted at the age of 60 and was found on a Bo@@ je without li@@ fe@@ jacket .
they came all aboard the coastal resort and were brought back to the rescue station
Mr. Jones said , &quot; The three men who were thrown into the water have to be injured and still to be alive .
the boat engine had a stop@@ pl@@ agues because , however , the boat crashed into the boat of the Bo@@ ots by the person who controls the boat .
now someone has gained over these men .
heavy viol@@ ated - man ste@@ pl@@ ess on his ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend
one man has attacked his ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and heavily injured .
as the police hur@@ ried yesterday , the 50 year old took the key to the apartment to get his personal things .
the alcohol reaction cut the clothes of his ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend instead .
when I came into the apartment , he went up twice on them .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured in his hand and by the body .
the police could remove the perpet@@ rators .
during the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend , he called his mother .
this al@@ arm@@ oured his sister .
together with her life , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wants to calm their brother .
she could not move it , but could not move the apartment .
therefore she went out of the house with her life .
on the street they met the ex @-@ living creatures of the man .
when the two women occupy the flat again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old turned his sister to the side and handle his ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend .
who builds Braun@@ schwei@@ gs favorable apartments ?
the SPD and Green my : investors will have to be much stronger in the future .
how can you respond to the bad news that Br@@ uns@@ wick will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments over the next few years ?
the SPD proposes to the next Council meeting a &quot; Hand@@ le Concept &quot; . &quot;
but dispute is programmed .
in first line it &apos;s about the question : who is supposed to be able to build the favorable apartments ?
a regulation is missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in future , the SPD faction leader Christoph Brat@@ mann believes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build on urban areas to build 20 percent of all apartments as a social dwellings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the favorable apartments can still remain in hol@@ dings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Great disp@@ utes in the Town Hall is , however , such as viol@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how do you want to build investors on private surfaces ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build investors at least 10 percent , but as much as 20 percent of the apartments are building as a social dwellings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new town of residential building programme , which will cost millions and is still to be financed for inc@@ en@@ tives .
the problem , such as viol@@ mann : &quot; there is currently no agreement between fac@@ tions . &quot;
the CDU would like to make investors very few regulations .
the left wants to take hardness levels for investors .
un@@ respec@@ ting , such as viol@@ mann , be@@ holding a deep@@ ening of the situation on the housing market .
the concept concept is implemented , will provide an additional tasks in the building administration .
more staff is needed .
it is un@@ clear if we get the skilled workers .
yet the program doesn &apos;t work completely : because the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments should be built .
but how do you compare the loss of another around 1300 holiday homes , whose funding is going to go out in the next few years ?
there will be 500 apartments only by 2020 .
to prevent this , the plann@@ ers spokes@@ person Nicole Palm , should now be purchased by the city now .
besides , it would have to be thought about it back to the prices back again .
that is possible in the western city .
in one stroke the problem would solve the problem .
because in the western city run time at the end of the year .
some 1800 apartments could get there back to the price for cheap apartments .
only : this would like to do the owners , the housing companies do not want .
because the number of social apartments in the western city will be dra@@ stically increased from the target of the so @-@ called mixture .
there should not be a concentration of social weak in just a few geographical parts .
the Green Party expect that there will be movement in discussion .
Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke writes : &quot; for a broad majority the CDU obtain the CDU with the boat . &quot;
they focused on more buildings for detached houses .
but what does not mean that yet a compromise could be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness , which is worth
it is fascinating to see how the world changes .
that teen@@ ager and child for games do not go beyond outside , but rather prefer@@ ring their leisure time to spend on screens , has been pro@@ claim in the last decade of many .
at Pok@@ em@@ on Go , people go to take people from the sofa and to be more active .
the time at the screen was initially displayed on the TV , then play video games and last on smartphones .
so it &apos;s great to see that technology and activities are not out in the open .
I &apos;m playing of course on the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that was created on the characters that were created for the video games in the 1990s ( later developed a cartoon animation , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
how many phenom@@ ena of pop culture sank the interest in front of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand in early July .
the market launch in other countries was post@@ pon@@ ed by massive demand that over@@ load the server .
within less days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go has more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , the players go out with their smart phones and searching for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons that were followed by a GPS as soon as they were found once , &quot; photographed &quot; ( via a screenshot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; taken prisoner . &quot;
one generation that played the game when she was still younger , joined the winding and j@@ ump@@ ed for the search of the sofa .
in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in steps which determines the average &quot; person every day .
Car@@ di@@ ver , an app for Apple Watch , who followed 35,000 users , divided the Washington Post recently with that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of people followed every day 30 minutes , from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company doesn &apos;t know who is playing Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - only the raw data for the performance increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public awareness programmes for health , people want to bring to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to come to &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; of the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be active every day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because many public messages are bo@@ red for health and come from people who look like . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be assessed .
who regularly drives sports , reduces his chances to ill cancer or depression .
physical activity helps with weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of advantages , which is too long to run them here .
but the wonderful of Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that there is people to do something in the open , that makes them fun .
thus three columns of health covered - movement , fresh air , sun@@ shine as well as fun .
some people close the hunt even new friends .
as always there is m@@ ür@@ ric gameplay , which must always be compl@@ ain about something .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what should it mean ?
it has a breakthrough .
even if smartphone apps had already able to follow our activity earlier than Fit@@ bit , they gave us no reason to exercise sports , as it does this game .
the new will lose its maturity and use it with the time .
however , due to Pok@@ em@@ on &apos;s success , there will be more games that can join apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world and will be able to help many people on the hunt , more active , f@@ itter and heal@@ th@@ ier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen
do not forget to print .
forget the h@@ ype .
Simone Bil@@ es is immune to all this .
dynamic on the j@@ umping horse .
effortlessly on the beams .
breathtaking on the ground .
brilliant on all the line .
and now the Olympic champion now .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American Tur@@ ner@@ in kl@@ ands on Thursday for multi@@ ple@@ a tracks and enlarged the gap between itself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the head@@ light of the Olympic Games .
their overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly in front of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; - Team kam@@ er@@ adin A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the American Simone Bil@@ es appear on the pi@@ p@@ sich@@ ord during the sole multi@@ ple@@ a of women in the art tournaments at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osexu@@ als American , which wins a challenging guide and a total of the fifth , while they have established their reputation to be the best of their generation or even at all .
they broke out in tears , when their final result was shown and their long journey took place at this moment .
this success represents them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Ph@@ el@@ ps who brought up their sports on new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years their sports competition , 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary L@@ ou rescue on her said that she is the best gym@@ n@@ ast , which I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
it was expected to be a final inspection in Brazil , a competition not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athl@@ ete , but rather , between it and a load over@@ sized expectations .
not with a hand@@ ful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered to be dis@@ appointment .
the American Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man emb@@ race with gold and silver in the individual multi@@ fac@@ ial of women in the art tournaments at the 2016 Olympic Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es took the first medal at Tuesday , while she was retired at the f@@ arewell party of Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi as an ex@@ clamation mark .
although Bil@@ es insi@@ sted , during their long distance to the top , never to have the future is not really true .
a part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is based on Latin American music , which would fit at home outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
that is no co@@ incidence .
this girl , adopted from their grand@@ parents as little child , adopted by train@@ ee A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school trip to the gym@@ nas@@ ium , was trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man .
since the summer of 2013 , she has not lost a combined competition for the summer of 2013 , a winner series that will keep so long as it wishes .
even if Must@@ af@@ ina led through two turns , the picture shows .
pi@@ p@@ ants and soil particles - in which Bil@@ es holds the world championship title - listen .
she again won 15,@@ 433 again on the pi@@ p@@ sich@@ ord - and put on a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground still one of them .
Ra@@ is@@ man emb@@ race her gently as her du@@ der@@ g@@ ous expected - a pure shap@@ ing - and tears , on Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue E@@ yel@@ iner , when the vision , which she described once in their collection book , became reality .
the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was a reven@@ ge for the last time four years ago when it fought for the third place , but the bronze medal went to a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke in Must@@ af@@ ina .
this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team cap@@ tures from the Americans called &quot; O@@ ma , &quot; a lead .
after their land , she threw her audience to the audience of Ethiopia , it was overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback that sometimes dou@@ bt@@ edly appeared .
as regards it , so that the 19 @-@ year @-@ olds suffered a completely new meaning from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims in series mur@@ der@@ ings at the music shot in the car
according to police reports that were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 year old girl were shot , who died in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since one decade in the first series of mur@@ der@@ y by Phoenix , while they stopped in the car and heard music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12th while the car was par@@ ked in a single trip , the authorities told .
the perpet@@ rators fired eight shots from a hand fire , while on the st@@ roll side of the car , and fled with another vehicle , to read in the report .
the police shared that the triple murder did not have the result of a pir@@ ated stuff , as the attack@@ ers did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 participated in the possession of one of the adult victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Phoenix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jonathan Howard , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jonathan Howard said that the shooting was directed to a closer look at that time , whether they are connected with four previous attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in total , seven people were killed and two other attacks were killed within four months in nine attacks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happens in a residential neighborhood in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Howard der K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month with . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is believed that the susp@@ ects has used several cars , including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to off@@ end the evidence that they have linked to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ der@@ ers .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hosp@@ ital@@ ized due to their injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit and listen to music in a par@@ ental car .
the authorities published a police report on the shooting , which led to an empty Pick@@ up @-@ Truck to a half hour prior to the triple @-@ murder and from that it was assumed that it was the work of the serial ri@@ pper .
investig@@ ators found Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen and secured a ball out of the seat as well as spher@@ ical fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ scope : &quot; it is better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves the singing , toys and of course his mother .
but like the f@@ ew@@ est of his age@@ ing , Edmund Optics , the result of a genetic disorder , has knew not about his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to during her pregnancy .
when he came home the first time , my first thought , I made it not .
I do not create it .
I did not let me go .
what &apos;s not right -- of course , one has dropped to it , &quot; she said .
her husband Vincent and her husband was told that Edmund she can never recognize them under circumstances and that he may not survive once .
some doctors went even so far that they beat him to institutions .
&quot; my first answer to it was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; declared Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to .
Edmund can run with help of a help .
Edmund could neither be cra@@ w@@ ling up to his third year of life , neither would he still talk .
but it &apos;s slowly adv@@ ances .
it can run with support and cycling .
he also loves to play and sing together with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the character language that Edmund for &quot; Please dressing me something &quot; out . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bring it character language to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; telling Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is no typical character language -- says she . Edmund has invented some character alone .
micro@@ genet@@ ically has a wide range of causes : genetic as with Edmund as well as infections with viruses such as mas@@ ons or the z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus during pregnancy .
symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it is the life of influence affected by the z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to reminds of the emotional prize of a certain future .
I asked What will happen ?
what will happen ?
and they still don &apos;t know .
I haven &apos;t been asked for a long time after the forecast , because I don &apos;t expect to really tell me someone .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has caused a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of inf@@ ecting babies that were caused by the z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus .
it will get better .
you know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
severe rainfall , floo@@ ding on the occasion of Res@@ cue in Louis@@ iana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
severe rainfall and severe floo@@ ding in Louis@@ iana forced the governor to call the emergency call on Friday . it is estimated that the Saturday morning was reck@@ oned with more rain .
numerous rivers in the southeast of Louis@@ ian@@ as and the South of Miss@@ issi@@ pp@@ is floo@@ ded their banks and threatened with large floo@@ ding after extreme rain , the National weather service reported .
the Govern@@ or of Louis@@ iana John Bel Edwards told that state officials died in contact with local authorities and already on the road to the affected municipalities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a speaker for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Prepar@@ edness with the Govern@@ ors , shared that the in@@ quiries for flood vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags multiplied .
Ste@@ ele said that only the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had sold ten thousands of sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is used across wide parts of the South Louis@@ ian@@ as until Saturday .
the weather service could be reliable that in this area additional 3 to 5 inches could fall due to rain .
on Friday an Fl@@ ut@@ early war@@ n@@ system was deployed on Friday in the south of Iran , while mobile is continued in the region .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ on near Den@@ ham Springs , which are both in Louis@@ iana , are reaching one of the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood with a record level of all probability .
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could cross many houses in the front objects of the Bat@@ on Rouge .
he also said that a flow down@@ wards directional in@@ flow in A@@ scen@@ sion Par@@ ish is a danger , as these are only slow to flow through the Lake Mau@@ re@@ as .
the Ri@@ fa@@ w river , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi State border in Liverpool , Louis@@ iana , reached the highest status on Friday as at 9@@ am .
rescue teams still still people from flood water in the district Am@@ ite and Wil@@ k@@ inson in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
Le@@ Roy H@@ ans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among the those who were saved on Friday in the vicinity of Glo@@ ster .
H@@ ans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from the house , rises strongly through night .
he said that there would be a further step@@ son that lives in the vicinity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are awake and f@@ lowed in water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ ans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my wa@@ ist .
his wife said H@@ ans@@ ford said that she was living in the 48 years where she had never seen such a high rise of the river .
H@@ ans@@ ford said that he and his family members had all disabilities and he was the only one that will swim .
H@@ ans@@ ford said that N@@ oth@@ el@@ fer had saved all three in a large military truck and had brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommodated until Friday .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the floods began to spread rapidly , since there were heavy rainfall , and that authorities evacu@@ ate evacu@@ ation assign@@ ments .
according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , a ob@@ servers near Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the floor has been considerably accomplished by the rain@@ forests since Wednesday .
authorities stated that heavy rainfall and road floo@@ ding the rescue of inhabitants from their houses in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and teaching in five school districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that one assigned houses in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa 200 survived homes .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated in two churches , which were both floo@@ ded .
the ruler of the municipality of Ro@@ bby Miller said that the authorities were res@@ cu@@ ed 72 people and seven pets .
in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , not@@ ices were established to accommodate the evacu@@ ation of the evacu@@ ation .
&quot; once the water starts to go back , they will return to their houses , &quot; he said .
in the town of Ham@@ mond of the commune of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of dozens were closed due to floo@@ ding and sand@@ bags for the residents , who hope to keep the water out of their houses and shops .
&quot; the last big flood , which we had , was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the City Council .
that seems like a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Count@@ ys , that it continues to rain on the Gulf Coast .
according to his data , a hand@@ ful of homes must be reported on Thursday as over@@ floo@@ ded , but on Friday they were not reported to have been reported .
K@@ eit@@ h Town@@ son , manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw water in places where I never have seen it before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it still comes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mah@@ aj Brown , 6 , &quot; by spher@@ es pier@@ ced , &quot; survived Le@@ ather into Philadelphia
the police divi@@ des that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week was the second time that a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child was shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boys identified him as Mah@@ aj Brown for C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the grand@@ parents stated that Brown had suffered several arch@@ ers , including in the L@@ ende , leg , arm and belly , but that he was at his transport in the hospital at consciousness .
&quot; he has made a lot , his smaller body was pier@@ ced by balls , &quot; his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ en@@ dez to the transmitter .
I can &apos;t believe that .
the condition of the boy was considered critical in a hospital and he had to under@@ go several operations .
the family of the boys shared the transmitter , that it is expected to recover .
he would have to begin the first class in a local primary school .
Brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in stable condition according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the young was found on the front seat of a car with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , which is located in a critical condition , reports the transmitter .
the other two victims were not found in the car and the police are just whether one of the last men of the perpet@@ rators could be found .
investigations divided C@@ BS Philadelphia with that apparently there was a cruci@@ fying fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ anc@@ sen for assault ri@@ fl@@ es which have been tra@@ ced back to different assault ri@@ ents , par@@ aly@@ sed the facts .
it seems that it clearly shows a continuous struggle .
on the road , on both sides of the case , were envelop@@ ed .
so it seems to have been several armed fighters , who were very actively involved , &quot; divided police p@@ mann Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di &apos;s police in Philadelphia to the transmitter .
several houses and vehicles were taken in the area .
there was no occas@@ ional parties and the police currently exam@@ ines the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 year old girl was hit by a cross @-@ ra@@ cket on the arm , when they played in front of her house in the area of West @-@ Lane Lane .
they re@@ covers and the police search for a susp@@ ect .
why we have Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I present myself under the women &apos;s fence and that consists of more than one reason .
first , since 1984 , I have never been so dominant since 1984 and the United States have never been so dominant .
and second : these team has three gym@@ n@@ ants , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren , Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired for many young girls of other skin colour .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew is and Madison Ko@@ cian , Cath@@ o@@ lic@@ kin , makes everyone proud .
this team reflects the United States .
it has established the black and His@@ pan@@ ic femin@@ ine presence at the top of this sport .
in the past four years , the number one was one of the female tur@@ ner@@ ves an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American .
last year , Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
this shows strength .
for the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas seen a surprise Olympics and America .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three @-@ time world champion Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez to be how she was unexpected , but master@@ ful gy@@ ma@@ st@@ ik@@ rout@@ ines .
on Thursday , Simone became the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osexual American woman who won gold medal for women .
man member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the tip of this sport , but so you can &apos;t see gym in the whole country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie initially beat all the same way like A@@ ly and Madison to create it to the Olympic team .
they are the &quot; Last Five , &quot; because the next Olympics will only have four gym@@ n@@ ants in the team . furthermore , the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi was as a train@@ ee .
but reality looks so that gym@@ nast@@ ic sports is a expensive sport and Turner first place in private gy@@ ms , which are calculated for the training , integration , travel , clothing , clothing and hotel costs ( for the trainer and their Turner and families ) . the list can be displayed as desired .
the majority of these turn@@ tables are located in we@@ al@@ thy suburbs that can support business .
in these clubs , Turner will receive a whole workout and that is for the families a most expensive and long @-@ term commitment .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , train@@ ee by Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both have trained their athletes , since they started with the Tur@@ nen .
we must be inn@@ um@@ erable to the municipalities of Au@@ n countless , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a strong and easy @-@ to @-@ reach turn@@ around .
I founded my turn@@ age of 20 years .
in my events we have offered free and affordable prices in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban you@@ ths ( especially black and His@@ pan@@ ic ) and national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth of high @-@ quality gym@@ nast@@ ics that earn the opportunity to learn from this great Olympic sports .
Tur@@ ns develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body and hard work , discipline and destination for the spirit .
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health and training success .
it is the inspiration of this team that bring thousands of young girls to care for the gym@@ nast@@ ics and that &apos;s great .
it &apos;s so important to participate in the sport , especially for girls .
this is an so exciting time .
thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; through the wood of the Olympic team gol@@ ds and thank you so many young girls motiv@@ ated to start their way to start healthy , strong and successful young women .
assist@@ ants want to organize more stri@@ kers after having rejected Jeremy Hun@@ ts proposal
the ministers hop@@ ing to end the dispute concerning the acceptance of a re@@ formed contract with the functioning of the British Medical Association , but 58 per cent of the 37@@ ,000 assist@@ ants who received him with a choice , refused him .
in July , Hunt plans already revealed to force the contract , and said that N@@ HS would be in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; and any further delay for employees and patients are harmful .
the first assist@@ ants will receive a new contract , which contains changes to night and weekend work to improve maintenance at risk times .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the BM@@ A company for assist@@ ants divided last night in a communication with : &quot; assistance to serious concerns , in particular that it will heat the current occupancy crisis and it will ab@@ sur@@ d to treat all doctors . &quot;
at only eight weeks that remain still remains until the first group of physicians will fall under the new contract , progress must be made and the time runs out .
efforts from the BM@@ A on the solution of disp@@ utes ar@@ ising from talks with the government on resist@@ ors themselves and sometimes on o@@ hren@@ ic silence .
it came to pass that , when Jeremy was last month , Jeremy was the last month that his door would always open .
&quot; Jeremy Hunt must now act to raise the asc@@ ension and speak the concerns of the assist@@ ants . &quot;
if he do not do this , so the assist@@ ants have made clear that they are ready to perform further work measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw a boost from almost 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 dates before , since n@@ urses and psychiat@@ rist@@ s were included in order to give anger on the stri@@ kers post .
the ministers hop@@ ing to end the dispute over the changes due to an acceptance by the British Medical Association &apos;s function of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A wants to pay a better week wage for the 54@@ .000 assist@@ ants that will be subject to contract .
Daniel Mor@@ ning , Director General of N@@ HS employees , ur@@ ged the assistant to termin@@ ate the strike .
Mor@@ ning said : &quot; labour amp@@ ons gain nothing but little , but have already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare for patients , care and their families only worry , need and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
in the last two months , we talked to the Com@@ mit of Assist@@ ants and to the Ministry of Health as well as other minist@@ ries to the concerns relating to the concerns and W@@ hist@@ leb@@ low@@ ings .
the employer hop@@ ed that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as deployment , flexibility in training , additional training for those who were living from a professional career , education , mutual recognition , the Health Education England and the health ministry regarding compliance with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day - medication that can reduce the heart attack
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day medication , after being recommended by the authorities to date more people for a longer period .
the inc@@ inn@@ ate drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with a heart disease .
the drug is administered for 12 months after a heart attack which reduces the risk of a stroke or another heart attack .
the N@@ HS regulation system is recommended by a four @-@ year dosage to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS regulation system is recommended by a four @-@ year dosage to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
around 14@@ 0.000 people each year suffer a heart attack and a quarter of it suff@@ ers another heart attack or a stroke .
heart attack and stroke cases are caused by enrich@@ ment fet@@ al material in the arter@@ ies , the flo@@ or@@ ings form .
when the flooring breaks , it may cause a blood cl@@ ots that causes the blood flow to the heart and caused a heart attack .
when the blood cl@@ ots solves , it may flow through the blood stream and caused blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
persons who had already a heart attack , are subject to a higher risk to have a further risk .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ zen@@ eca is distributed and distributed under the trading name Br@@ ili@@ que , reduces this risk by un@@ likely the formation of blood cl@@ ots un@@ likely .
the guidance of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 month dosage of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with twice daily intake of A@@ spir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Auth@@ orities , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary pre@@ prevention , a quarter of all people who suffered a heart attack have suffered a further heart attack or a stroke . &quot;
fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with asp@@ ir@@ in is effectively reducing the reduction of other heart attacks against people who had already a heart attack .
by a preliminary recommendation of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or we are looking forward that we are able to expand the treatment options of thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of blood - is limited to a period of up to three years . the line design recommends no treatment that goes beyond that period .
culture of Political Cor@@ respon@@ ness to act in Muslim areas
former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year for corruption of a government report because of corruption from the office .
a culture of the Political Cor@@ respon@@ ness has led to the widespread elections in Muslim congregations will be igno@@ red as a devastating government report today .
Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es , the former cabin member Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es vent@@ ures to ignore the police , election observation and coun@@ cils , to ignore the evidence of election abuse regarding Eth@@ nie and Religion . &quot;
the former minister of integration and municipal government , which is now an ant@@ agon@@ ising from religious mot@@ ives , said that the police should be permitted to set off the police outside of elec@@ tors outside elec@@ tors .
he recommends that voters should lead to a reference to prove their identity in the elections .
at the moment , a voters must be called only his name and title .
the report suggests to apply no rem@@ n@@ able ink on the finger of a person if they vote their elec@@ toral voice , to avoid that someone cho@@ oses twice .
W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower should get more protection , says Sir Eric .
it demands that the press should have more access to the municipal documents and decisions of not official committee or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not only against elec@@ toral law , but also the municipal government also aims to protect against the wider corruption and financial institutions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by the Dow@@ ning Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets election in the east of London .
last year , a special court decided that the Mayor of West Lut@@ on Rah@@ man should be met upon corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry .
the court found that Rah@@ man had stopped the religious feelings of his Muslim Community &quot; in cy@@ n@@ ical manner , &quot; and that he would have brought his critics with R@@ ass@@ is@@ sm@@ us@@ - and Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ ist@@ ani .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man should have led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his campaign in the foundation that it is the rel@@ ational duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ edly or the result of a re@@ spiration , in which one person cho@@ oses a person as someone else .
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fr@@ aud in the whole country .
in particular , he expressed themselves al@@ ar@@ ming down to the fr@@ au@@ dul@@ ent paper code - when the older members of the Muslim Community had made people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean the elec@@ toral system , including the guidance of evidence to prove the identity
in his report it is stated : &quot; as proof that pressure on protection needs of some ethnic min@@ orities have been exercised , especially women and young people , in order to vote in accordance with the Will of El@@ der , in particular Communities with pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ic or ban@@ ist@@ ical background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions have contributed such behavior due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; polit@@ ically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Over@@ seas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding eth@@ nic@@ ity and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric said 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition to edit political activists in order to reap &quot; election harvest . &quot;
the report , which is drawn from Ther@@ esa May in consideration , also demands har@@ der registration checks to prevent the elec@@ toral directory for immig@@ ration and social operators .
consider options to ask elec@@ tors in your choice after your identification .
do not use rem@@ n@@ able ink on the finger of a person as soon as she has given her voice to avoid that someone cho@@ oses twice .
systematic verification review of the nationality of a person to make sure that they are not eligible .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications to a automatic post@@ age selection .
a ban on political activists and envelop@@ es of letters .
the police give the powers to create paragra@@ phs around elec@@ toral stations .
a law change that charges an accus@@ ation for duty in accordance with the repression of the People Act 1983 ( The People &apos;s Legal Act 1983 ) .
photography made in elec@@ toral stations .
requirement that only English may be used in the elec@@ toral stations ( except for Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training , to ensure that the employees do usually pass through that elec@@ tors are alone in the elec@@ toral cabin .
Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case there was no criminal complaint .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ele@@ ction Court has Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy , due to a lit@@ ur@@ ion of corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was found guilty on the basis of a number of reasons for reasons - according to the high requirements in the criminal procedure - guilty .
he also critic@@ ises the most effective &quot; Ab@@ h@@ ak@@ checks &quot; of the coun@@ cils of coun@@ cils .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court ruling in Tower Ham@@ lets from last year was a warning signal .
our country , as the mother of the par@@ liam@@ ents , is a proud heritage , but the wor@@ sen@@ ing of election and destruction of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation .

a mother of two children , J@@ enny David@@ son , who had at the same time in the business , said that after the mysterious woman had tried the under@@ wear , &quot; she caught up again and left the shop without buying it . &quot;
she said , &quot; The people could not believe what they saw . &quot;
in the middle of the sale area , it took a pair of under@@ p@@ ants from the out@@ lay , moved their own sh@@ ir@@ ants and tro@@ users and tried them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she did not even find a little dis@@ crete place to do it - it was just like Oskar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everybody star@@ red when they did not like the under@@ p@@ ants that you did not like it , since they put it back into the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same with three other under@@ p@@ ants before it finally decided that their nothing was right to register and went out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she seemed to distur@@ bing her , that it observed , or thinking about the person who had to buy the under@@ p@@ ants who had tried them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

David David@@ son added : &quot; as I have received , the staff tried to draw the pieces of pieces from the sale once she went - which is the same . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would love to go with a new pair of under@@ p@@ ants to go home and find out that another woman had touched her and did not be washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

how to protect with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a from weapons attacks
the world outside is a dangerous site , but this video of D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com might make it a bit saf@@ er for you .
we talked to Rh@@ one Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to walk with armed th@@ iev@@ es at hand .
no matter whether you want from the front or behind it will show you this video , as you turn off for your rob@@ ber .
if you turn back from behind , you should turn to yourself as yourself , so that you can see your attack@@ ers and turn off from the line , &quot; says Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi .
take the weapon then between your fore@@ arm and your shoulder before you beat before it with your free el@@ bow .
then beat him with the knees to the l@@ ath and turn down , while the attack@@ ers come together off pain , the weapon from his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move back , while they set the gun on him .
for anxi@@ ous , that is approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the shot line , take the weapon , and turn them , so that attack@@ ers cannot shoot .
spread the weight at the same time and beat the gun on the chest , then turn the weapon from its handle , before moving back and arrange the weapon to him .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how to make Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that it is in a rob@@ ber@@ y at the saf@@ est , your money is enough - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ masters .
excursion Ian Wright for a guide of his tongue to the most dirty places of Europe
a British travel reas@@ oning his immune system and t@@ rough@@ ness of a serious exam - leaving some of the most dirty places of Europe .
the moder@@ ator and it@@ aut@@ or Ian Wright , 51 , made from Suff@@ olk its course on a euro banknotes , a rail@@ ing at the Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Cir@@ cus , a sc@@ aling toilet and a public telephone in Russia to demonstrate the resistance to its immune system .
before demol@@ ition any object it used a lumin@@ ometer to show up and show us what it is left .
but the experiment , titled &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; brought some surprising results of daylight .
the thought that r@@ ins@@ ing the ins@@ ing kno@@ b of a pull @-@ toilet , which was used already by thousands of others , may be completely det@@ ectable , but indeed there are more poor bacteria .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical specialists in the promotion of intest@@ inal bacteria and his own health .
lu@@ ck@@ ily did not leave what he le@@ aked , more than a bad re@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. Wright has been known to test the resistance of his gut by the world , where he travelled through the world and ate strange things as well as wonderful things .
from public funds at railway stations till the r@@ ins@@ ing kno@@ bs of toilets , the task was defin@@ ite the immune system definitely under a sample
in the film he told : &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about what my health was about and I have put all possible things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and sl@@ ud@@ ge . &quot;
in the film he was justified with his reputation in the film .
the only thing he was le@@ aning , was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his pros@@ thesis showed a lumin@@ ance of over 4000 units .
in comparison , the L@@ umin@@ omet@@ ry is fresh@@ ly washed hands less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to refuse after its L@@ umin@@ ometric number was over 4000 units , while fresh@@ ly washed hands have a less than 60 .
Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; which shows the bacter@@ ias number in different locations like the bathroom
in the film , he says : &quot; this is the worst , what I smo@@ ked in a toilet , near . &quot;
there is nothing dirt than that !
I will not laugh here because it is inside or in@@ con@@ ical .
&quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company st@@ et Mr. Wright with Vali@@ o Ge@@ ography , which contains both Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illi as well as vitamin C and D to support the support of intest@@ inal bacteria and immune system .
validation Senior Venice President for snacks , ju@@ ices and new categories N@@ iko Vu@@ j@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to have something new to consumers .
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time the advantages of Pro@@ biot@@ ics explains .
we conducted a mad Bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings that concluded that we said &quot; Let us call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in the intest@@ inal health will become a global phenomenon
instead of just over the products we wanted to put it into a larger context - the good and poor bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of the intest@@ inal health and how it is associated with the immune system .
growing interest in the intest@@ inal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide the consumer more information on an interesting way .
I think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the direction of the film , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let it be said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had suffered some of the things I have instructed him , such as the most beautiful Russian toilet which is shown in the film &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course there were things , with which it was easier to bring Ian , she anz@@ il@@ ateral and others , where this was quite difficult .
I &apos;m glad that we recorded some of these dirty l@@ ads on movie . &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o conducted by 84 percent of all respon@@ dents of Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illi in particular with the bene@@ factors of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 per cent said they are using at least occasionally products that include the enclosed lac@@ tic acid bacteria .

once they were for@@ ci@@ bly removed from their property , the property of housing cooperative has found the property in an ir@@ repair condition .
the walls rejected the pl@@ aff@@ ing holes on wood , sh@@ ri@@ mp was lo@@ oted on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti has been lubric@@ ated on the walls .
the family were transferred and it is believed that they now lives in a private accommodation
Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ o@@ y , who works for the house administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that she is not to repair the apartment .
she said , &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare here and I am the view that people don &apos;t need to live in this way .
there are many things to take into consideration because this property is thought to be considered as a beautiful part of Corn@@ walls .
the family is inf@@ am@@ ous and her reputation is also .
the pair had three sons , who lived for the time in the apartment and the police said that the terror , who had added the family , in@@ timi@@ date tra@@ cker , drug abuse , drug tra@@ ff@@ les , drugs and exc@@ essive cry , stre@@ aks and curse .
sk@@ el@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease agreement , received an arrangement for ant@@ is@@ o@@ cial behaviour in June .
in some rooms of the house that will be demolished under circumstances , old gar@@ bage was found
it has been listed in the estate where drugs have been tra@@ ded in the past drugs .
neighbours therefore said that they strug@@ gled together on the road and had to rec@@ alled the police regularly
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ og@@ ed them and its partners , violent by the property , after giving them a extended period of 11 weeks to volunte@@ er .
the del@@ etion have been sh@@ aken by facilit@@ ated neighbours that their lives were made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were ashamed of anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times that we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; tomorrow we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet - that we are not usual !
now , where they are gone , it will be beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it would have to co@@ operate the family with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police was called at regular intervals , 20 years long
on the left side of the house , gar@@ bage and old toys were thrown down
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dis@@ grace that it ab@@ h@@ ates the ten@@ ant to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and their families , as a del@@ etion is always the last step , the Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extremely difficult , and their actions for her neigh@@ bors had to be seen horri@@ bly .
I guess all the work that my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the church , have gone to us and have done us the information .
I hope that these developments will give some neigh@@ bors and gives the message that ant@@ is@@ o@@ cial behavior is not toler@@ ated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but they all were over 20 .
a dirty mattress included in one of the bedrooms of the house after the delay on the floor .
workers of the house administration now need to wake up the land@@ ings , surrounded by the house
in 2014 , the police conducted a raid in the house and found about 70@@ g cannabis as well as orph@@ ans , par@@ ap@@ her@@ al@@ ies and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
sk@@ el@@ don received a fine of fine , after being guilty of the owner &apos;s possession of a drug in terms of trading .
she claimed that the money was a grave of her son Lee Skel@@ don who came into a car accident in 2013 .
after that without shelter , it is assumed that T@@ anya and their partners are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ymouth .
many room walls of the house were awarded with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says that they will not commit r@@ enter who do not keep the assignment of the house
Angela C@@ row by the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall shared that the Del@@ og@@ ing is a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not keep the assignment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is to those who think that they can be found themselves without self @-@ related . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Devon and Corn@@ wall Police will never toler@@ ate criminal and ant@@ is@@ o@@ cial behaviour that continues to work with partners in order to protect our communities .

tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro were moved to Pan@@ ik , when the plane came from the darkness and flew extremely deep .
the Portuguese Air Force sent today that the pilot of the P @-@ 3C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight to identify f@@ isch@@ boats in front of the coast and thereby deeply fly that this is the only possibility to detect them .
the spokes@@ man said that the jet was somewhat lower than usual in the area near to the bad vision , however , the air force showed that the safety was at no time end@@ anger@@ ed .
area fires destroyed those summer parts of Portuguese forti@@ fications , where four people came to death on the island of Madeira .
the Portuguese Air Force sent today that the pilot had to fly due to the circumstances - strong fog and fire - as deep as he had to restri@@ cts its perspective

Donald Tr@@ ump Rooms &quot; mighty problems &quot; in election campaign
the leadership of U.S. rep@@ ublic@@ ans will pl@@ agu@@ ed their majority in traditionally conservative federal states .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump gave now the weakness of his campaign campaign in the existing Republi@@ can Hoch@@ burg Ut@@ ah .
a rare moment in which the multi @-@ track and self @-@ regul@@ ating mul@@ tim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire had something like to be expressed as correspon@@ dent &apos;s correspon@@ dents .
after having cast 16 ri@@ vals within the own republi@@ can camp , the doub@@ ts now grow to his success in the battle around the White House .
&quot; we have massive problems in Ut@@ ah , &quot; said Tr@@ ump before evangel@@ ical Christians who he asked support in key states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia .
false reports are false reports of its candi@@ dat@@ ure , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media st@@ ained .
republi@@ can high bur@@ ns
Ut@@ ah is normally a secure bank for the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ ard from June to June Tr@@ ump and his competitors from the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton had the same .
other institutes see tr@@ ump in front , but not with the distance that are usual for Republi@@ can candidates in the state of state .
as end@@ anger@@ ed , Arizona and Georgia are considered end@@ anger@@ ed .
in an interview with the CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump answered the question as he was again to stop the advance of Clin@@ cke : &quot; as I have done it so far . &quot;
and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be either very successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he doesn &apos;t make any more like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to tell the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is not rich for him at the end for reasons of political correc@@ t@@ ness , that &apos;s order , Tr@@ ump said .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the Party Tr@@ ump was alleged to submit to the support of his elec@@ toral campaign , it should not be able to present no better circulation .
instead of what you would like to take the candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans to meet the arms below the arms .
Olympia : turning Sc@@ am at D@@ oping test
the IOC plans to set up a Dis@@ cipl@@ ine Commission in the case .
Ken@@ yan athletes is threat@@ ening after the second d@@ oping aff@@ air at the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games .
after an attempt attempt at a D@@ oping control in the Olympic Village , Kenya sent a trainer in Kenya .
the International Olympic Committee had to set up a discipline for discipline to investigate the case .
a ken@@ etian function had told that the former Sprinter and today coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic village a Ur@@ in @-@ rehear@@ sal , under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ l@@ essor Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i .
this is the team of Ken@@ ias have been reported by the d@@ oping control agencies .
the IA@@ AF world association has searched the IOC for information about the case to rig@@ orous investigations into an IA@@ AF speaker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the study and the following measures of the IOC the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in an IA@@ AF statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the d@@ oping control station and has written itself as Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i , the rehear@@ sal and signed , &quot; explained Ken@@ yan Chef de Mission Stephan ar@@ ap So@@ i .
he was the possession of the ac@@ creditation of the athl@@ ete , who stood on the list of training controls in the world &apos;s anti @-@ d@@ oping agency .
Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i had become more than 800 metres in Beijing at the Beijing World Championship in 2015 .
four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan Athlet@@ ics delegation Michael Rot@@ i was deduc@@ ted from the Rio Olympics .
he is supposed to be informed about d@@ oping sport@@ s@@ men through the country about pending d@@ oping tests .
according to media reports , he was arrested in Nairobi at his return to the airport of Nairobi .
Kenya has already been under special observation for a long period of time at the IOC in 1993 .
with the announcement of the IOC recorded more than 2000 D@@ oping target control in front of Rio games , unusual , particularly athletes from Kenya and Russia must be taken off .
the world &apos;s anti @-@ d@@ oping agency had exercised much pressure on the African country in Brazil , an anti @-@ d@@ oping law and a functioning control system .
the law was approved a few weeks before the Olympia @-@ Start .
the WA@@ DA in Kenya took the WA@@ DA in Kenya from the list of countries whose d@@ oping control form is compliant with the WA@@ DA rules .
Kenya is considered a large runner @-@ nation .
athletes of the country won the most medals in Beijing at the 2015 World Championship in Beijing .
in a series of TV reports on the ARD , the ARD were repeatedly raised to be easily accessible in Kenya &apos;s d@@ oping means and to give it a significant ment@@ ality of the sports bet@@ ru@@ gs .
IOC member Richard Po@@ und called for a similar investigation in Kenya , as he had placed them in the Russian field athlet@@ ics .
it was demonstrated that in this sport @-@ surface area and system@@ ically s@@ d@@ op@@ t was found .
Russia &apos;s athletes were then excluded from the summer of summer .
Salzburger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli
in the Shakespeare @-@ year , the Salzburg Festival will present the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Mary as a portable couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et .
with a surprising Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli .
a musical to Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ one masterpiece .
the artistic director Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classic and filled with the role of Mary a youth space .
in the orchestra , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Symphony Orchestra under the direction of the Venezuel@@ an conductor Gust@@ av@@ o D@@ ud@@ amel : &quot; this music is full of rhythm . &quot;
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and mel@@ ody .
it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bern@@ st@@ eins really in our blood !
in this st@@ aging , Bart@@ oli plays an older Mary .
she re@@ members with mid@@ wives with Tony , while the younger Maria is playing and dance .
the role of Mary has always fascin@@ ated me .
first because they are musi@@ cally exceptional !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
she says it in her song : &quot; I Love Pre@@ t@@ ty , oh , Pre@@ t@@ ty , I Love Pre@@ t@@ ty and White and B@@ right . &quot;
it &apos;s smart , of course , n@@ ai@@ v , and very passionate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she resem@@ bles me very , my Italian character which I have as a Rö@@ mer@@ in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laugh@@ s Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ ud@@ amel is a wonderful artist for the opera singer : &quot; Cec@@ ilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such a honor to work with you .
she is a troubled man .
and Bart@@ oli gives the compli@@ ments : &quot; D@@ ud@@ amel is an extraordinary artist and passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
one can see it in any of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life !
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a che@@ er@@ ful approach to life that is very important at all !
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this piece it is about ant@@ ages and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , we did the refugees at that time , at that time the d@@ er@@ tor@@ ic@@ ans went to New York , and the New York inhabitants didn &apos;t want to do it .
the same topics are the same topics , and they are as strong as they are .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .

the chief editor of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his neck @-@ magazine of classic school play@@ boys has happened , since &quot; Play@@ boy for males be . &quot;

Turkey : Kur@@ dish municipality counts with mass cur@@ ses
&quot; whoever does not fit and clo@@ ve the Erd@@ og@@ an , sits on packed caffeine , &quot; says the Chair of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Dialogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un .
the Kur@@ dish congregation , Germany anticip@@ ates ten thousands of protection seek@@ ers who fled from Turkey to Germany in short time .
in the medium term , it could even be &quot; some hundred thousand &quot; , the applicant of the Ali Top@@ ra@@ k , believes .
because of the hard relief of the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erd@@ og@@ an , the Kur@@ dish Municipality of Germany expects mass destruction to Germany in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I reck@@ oning with tens of thousands in the medium term , with some hundreds of thousands of protection from Turkey in Germany , when the Erd@@ og@@ an regime strug@@ gles to min@@ orities and the democratic opposition &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World Top@@ ra@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the government had covered the government in advance with Criminal facts , 500,000 Kur@@ ds within Turkey on the run .
after the post@@ ulated p@@ utsch , it was still sec@@ ular and op@@ positi@@ onal ethnic Turks .
many will want to be re @-@ start in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that res@@ umes its refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chief of Defence accused the targeted settlement of Syrian Arab@@ s in Kur@@ dish , but also in al@@ ev@@ it@@ alian towns .
that would increase Erd@@ og@@ an to the remaining cur@@ b to the remaining cur@@ d .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks were extinct already over the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CDU member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the government demanded that the Federal Government position itself &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erd@@ og@@ an and his followers . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also in Germany one &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wit@@ ch hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Erd@@ og@@ an critics &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time I feel no longer in Germany for the first time .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also feared the escape of many Turks .
more Turks are looking for asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Opp@@ os@@ ition@@ er .
the fire market as a Gü@@ len , destroyed teachers and other academ@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; whoever does not fit and clo@@ ve the Erd@@ og@@ an , sits on packed caffeine , by the way even the Kem@@ alists and Sec@@ ular , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Dialogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as the newspaper reported on appeal by the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the Turks already made the largest group of asylum in Germany before the coup .
as at 30 June this is 11.@@ 386 people and therefore almost 29 per cent of all accepted as as@@ yl@@ ac@@ am acknowledged ( 3@@ 9.@@ 625 ) .
this survey cannot be found in front of war , poverty , or Per@@ c@@ tiv@@ el@@ ess@@ ness .
asylum request according to the Basic Law are exclusively polit@@ ically , so from stat@@ eless side , individually persecuted .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ ommern : &quot; where to go there , where it does &quot;
the Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ ommern : loc@@ als get nothing from the summer campaign with - and the holiday from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country .
they understood in Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ ommern .
2021 will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays at the end of the summer holidays .
as far as until now , it is not : summer holidays , heat and land he@@ ats - that bit@@ es .
the loc@@ als that are to be impressed by the elec@@ tors , are on vacation .
most of the tourists who are in the country are on U@@ se@@ dom , R@@ ügen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not a native , so may not choose the country &apos;s day .
there are practical problems : in the holidays , hel@@ pers , posters hang on , air bal@@ lo@@ ons , fl@@ yers , and drove to them by the end of the vote , just lab@@ oured .
until September 4 , 2016 , the election and last day of the day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ ommern has to pass over the people &apos;s election campaign once again .
the hot phase , if you can say it at all , has just begun .
and it also goes to something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CDU coalition , has to be afraid .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CDU .
exciting how strongly Ne@@ ul@@ ing Af@@ D will cut and what remains difficult for the end of the end .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 head of head , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive campaign , one sees his grand@@ parents .
he travels across the country , spread , and pl@@ u@@ eth a little with men , as it is already his legendary advert@@ iser Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff .
otherwise , sail@@ ors have got cold feet and Chancellor Merkel bl@@ ame the bl@@ ossom of the Af@@ D .
their refugee policy , her &quot; We are creating the &quot; A@@ scen@@ sion of the sp@@ oo@@ op@@ o@@ ists , what &apos;s thought to do it now .
the CDU with her top @-@ edge data , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced , as it is , if you make the right time at the right place of election campaign .
she has been invited twice as a Chancellor Angela Merkel ; Merkel &apos;s federal circuit lies in the northeast .
but the target group did not agree that there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as the Mecklenburg @-@ Westphalia and Vor@@ p@@ ommern .
&quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; accused of Vincent Kok@@ ert , General Secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ ommern more recently in N@@ DR .
but it &apos;s a shame even anyone from the other corners of Germany , who Angela Merkel can listen to Angela Merkel .
otherwise , the Nord@@ ost @-@ CDU explo@@ res largely on the common constitu@@ encies in market@@ places and in front of shopping centers with paras@@ ols and bal@@ lo@@ ons .
this is , co@@ ca@@ ine , and plays only a &quot; minor role . &quot;
even the Union has noted that in the country the base had the base so that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people .
you are like the left , the SPD , the Green Party : hardly exists in the times of the country .
however , the Council of the CDU @-@ Ele@@ ph@@ er Kok@@ ert to his fel@@ low@@ soldier is however also self @-@ explan@@ atory : &quot; you have to go where it is doing , wherever the people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden weddings , each birthday party must be used . &quot;
because a lot on the game stands , Sell@@ ering has now called his SPD on a particularly committed election campaign .
in poll@@ s , the Socialists and Democrats continue with 22 percent behind partners CDU ( 25 ) and just under the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
in the election in 2011 the SPD gained clearly at 3@@ 5.6 percent before the CDU ( 22 ) .

B@@ 27 @-@ Rehabilitation : guest facilities suffer under wave trap
at the speed , with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ it@@ ated , there is nothing to m@@ ap@@ se .
for the persons of the construction work , which begin at 5.@@ 30 o &apos;clock in the morning and only lasted until 20 o &apos;clock , there are praise praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they all have quite co@@ red , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says El@@ vira T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the jet fuel station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a superb team .
there is no default .
the building site was scheduled to be moved to the south end of October , until the end of October everything will be ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is also responsible for the construction work , approximately when it comes to set up the facility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the construction site on Monday to the south , and also the locking of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen was lifted and so also the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg has been restored , the traffic situation has been relaxed in the place .
citizens can now return from O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen to the B 27 again .
the traffic through the place seems to be back .
&quot; there were some significant complaints , &quot; says the manager responsible for the traffic management manager Florian King . &quot;
the residents of Bach &apos;s street , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ n@@ erst@@ raße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many battles were sought and more their Nav@@ i were confi@@ ded as the signs .
what led to that poor truck was in residential areas .
since the speed limit must not be observed , the community intensi@@ fies the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ sing .
&quot; there were significant differences , &quot; says King who made himself a spot on the location .
since two up to three per minute have been produced .
the fastest @-@ speed was at 77 @-@ km / h in the h @-@ 30 zone .
since the construction site has been continued , but it has become a quiet .
for the business@@ men at the B 27 , it &apos;s only a small comfort that is now open to customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg to open the road again .
business@@ men cannot be found in the cards .
but that the B 27 re@@ san@@ itation has led to them at stake , everyone who asks to look through .
however some more and some less are affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; who has made less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; final clients &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which , for which other firms , has hardly been produced for the refurb@@ ishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thomas Sul@@ z says Thomas Sul@@ z , also speaks of a &quot; maximum light drop , &quot; but also a means that naturally &quot; the drive is missing . &quot;
on the strongest passing are the Local along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly Crown , finds distinct words .
that is already existing threat@@ ening .
not only him , but all the restaurants have it hard hit . &quot;
it lack@@ ed the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil .
we have to be glad about every Euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sales tax in sales rose to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far above 50 per cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
road marking have been thrown into operation &quot; by two years . &quot;
he had to put away half of his staff .
when I had a company with 4000 employees and the half would have been released , politics would have responded differently .
instead , Mayor of Jörg Schmidt on an en@@ quiry from G@@ öh@@ ner , whether it could give a financial compensation otherwise , the guest may benefit from the advantages of the situation at the B 27 . now they also have the dis@@ advantages to carry out through the renovation .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other rural districts where something generous is handled .
in all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that its restaurant will continue to continue .
after all , the family enterprise has already been located here since 17@@ 15 , he refers to the long history .
that other stem guests are now able to drop less frequently due to the complicated traffic leadership , he can understand .
if you do not come near , it is pretty different .
that his tri@@ bal was returned after the end of the renovation work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt .
despite the cr@@ ises with BSE and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner keeps the effects of the B 27 construction works to its clients for the largest crisis that has experienced the restaurant in its long @-@ standing history .
six months of construction work , which is already brutal .
the terror attack is constantly ob@@ stru@@ cted in the name of the terror attack .
according to recent proposals , Minister of Interior in Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now a th@@ icker security package .
but what does a Dul@@ ce status do with terror ?
and what does the Ko@@ al@@ izing partner says to all that ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the Re@@ conc@@ iler .
all his proposals are polit@@ ically acceptable to the coalition partner &quot; polit@@ ically , &quot; the Federal Minister says the introduction of his new security package .
they claim to be con@@ founded .
others , other points would initially be discussed within the parties .
also I present myself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister of the Interior , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; But the Minister of Interior is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ cover@@ able con@@ sens@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the Coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , he stopped a little time before completing his conclusions for the safety in the republic .
but they are all the more extensive .
a lot is already known , announced , announced that a new security authority has to take care of the neck @-@ encrypted communication is not new .
it is also not the fact that Germany must implement several EU directives on aircraft data and arms law .
the reputation after more CC@@ TV surveillance and staff for security agencies does not sur@@ pris@@ ingly sur@@ pris@@ ingly .
as part of the party , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère starts a second stop for suggestions that previously did not have to do with the SPD : he wants to eng@@ age sympath@@ y for terror groups , and jihadists having double citizenship to the German Pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CDU @-@ Man &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he still retain this for reasonable and do not need to have any opportunities regarding Ko@@ al@@ izing partner .
a few new ideas to be presented by Mai@@ zi@@ ère .
they were partially involved in itself : it is planning rapid procedures for shi@@ fts and more possibilities to shift people from deportation .
refugees who have targeted specifically to the country are expected to check their smartphone in advance and make social media accounts for a security check .
in Dul@@ ce for previous asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to submit some even worse than ever - such that off@@ ends offen@@ ders or their papers to make their identity uncovered .
some of them is polit@@ ically and legally hei@@ rs .
man@@ ches still operates un@@ balanced and leaves questions open .
and with some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of commem@@ oration of the example - is the question : what does this actually have to do with security and terror ?
yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the topics of refugees and terror .
but it cannot be expressed in speech that the assassination of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg ur@@ ged refugees .
in addition , many people faced with the high number of refugees in view of the security .
and things , who employed people , were now not left out in elec@@ toral seasons .
the inner safety is enormous in the focus .
first the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nizza .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the f@@ use is large .
and yes , it is standing up .
Union and SPD increasingly put in position on the subject of internal security .
in the last days it went up between the two parties .
only a gar@@ ho@@ ist dispute over the equipment of the federal police , then about a security policy collection of some German Interior Minister , in which the departments is also called a Bur@@ ka ban and a return from dual citizenship .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère - too bad here too .
he doesn &apos;t receive anything from a turn from the double pass .
we have satisfied the discussion in Germany .
you want to raise it , don &apos;t make sense .
and with a Bur@@ ka prohibition , he is a constitutional obj@@ ections .
either his own par@@ cel at all corners is constitu@@ ent and whether it actually is &quot; reasonable &quot; for the ambitious partner , it has to show itself .
there is some thing about what &apos;s going to fight for war .
but the SPD also tries to pro@@ filing an inner security on the subject of internal security .
Part@@ ic@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ alized only to talk with a talk time and says : &quot; the SPD is willing to talk about everything which contributes to the security to further increase safety . &quot;
yet Volkswagen is still going through .
despite diesel sc@@ and@@ als , the extra@@ dition will advance worldwide .
but not in all markets it runs .
in case of re@@ voc@@ al action , there are verteb@@ ra@@ e about a term .
Volkswagen will start placing the deliveries in the second half of the year .
in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ run markets , Europe &apos;s biggest motor@@ ways can continue to show an increase in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ run markets .
but in July the core brand was weaker primarily in Western Europe and thus stressed the total sales , as stated in the D@@ ax @-@ listed company .
the VW in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars sold 1.8 percent less vehicles compared to the previous year &apos;s figure .
sales in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
in the home market of Germany , deliveries delivered by almost a sixth month .
chief manager Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann introduced the weaker numbers from July , mainly on two sales days less in Europe .
in addition , there have been a stock exchange in some core markets by &quot; altered economic conditions . &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote resulted in the EU &apos;s withdrawal from the EU , explained a spokes@@ person .
in the United States , where the exhaust aff@@ air had to es@@ cal@@ ate first , also a min@@ us is too be@@ ech .
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
in total , the primarily affected domestic brand of Lower Saxony will continue with the diesel sc@@ and@@ al : after the first seven months , merely an extra@@ dition of 0.9 percent to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles is available .
Group CEO Fred Kap@@ pler was able to show another sales expansion from January to July .
at least 1.3 percent more vehicles supplied Volkswagen in this period , around 5,@@ 904 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had manip@@ ulated a software tests .
in Germany alone , VW will call around 2.5 million cars to upgrade to the workshops .
in the course of the re@@ arm@@ ament , VW showed that the conversion of cars has no negative effects .
after upgrading the vehicles , there is no fuel consumption in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor power .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the bus stop to the customer after re@@ arm@@ ament a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee certificate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but dis@@ closure not from a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee on Friday in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reason are legal entities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported , Volkswagen granted its German customers now a guarantee for the diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was confirmed by the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Monday , last Monday .
the department of the department has been confirmed that this meeting was given .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has completed the editions of my investigation committee and KBA complete . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; deviations of these are not accepted , &quot; explained by Federal Minister of Justice Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry .
VW has acquired the guarantee that in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor capacity after retro@@ fitting no wor@@ sen@@ ing , and all typ@@ ing relevant vehicle values remain unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as stated in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the wide concept &quot; guarantee &quot; Volkswagen provides that customers for example a half year after retro@@ fitting around with a car damage to a workshop - and that could lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do .
also in customer interest , it is important to avoid that there is no other damages with et@@ ch@@ and@@ al , that &apos;s nothing to be assured concerning any warranty requirements as it was called .
this is why the VW is not using the term &quot; warranty &quot; .
Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund is demands on Lake T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see as the second Institute in Germany as the second Institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; bank@@ rupt@@ cy Josef Paul said on Thursday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is only 139 customers that park 40 million Euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or daily exchange . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German Federal Association of German banks speaks of one single incident and sees no signal : normal Sav@@ ings must not be afraid to pay for her au@@ ster@@ ity criminal law . &quot;
if bank account banks money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , you have to pay 0.4 percent penalty .
this fee requires Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate customers for deposits over 100,000 euros to gi@@ ro@@ - or daily accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 will cost € 400 in the year &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has spent 40 million Euros that could be withdrawn from one day to another , and that he could not understand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bank account will lie between me and the central bank account and may cause 0.4 per cent expense &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t lay up for each million 4000 Euro . &quot;
the cost will be according to the default principle of the principle .
the cash is simply to be stored in the saf@@ er of Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank , would have been too dangerous : &quot; I have seen four survi@@ ving , I would not say the fifth ! , &quot; said the Chief Financial Officer .
most customers have understanding and changes to other investment forms .
only few immig@@ rants to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative association Bayern declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB causes considerable costs &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they alone bear , be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanently permanent permanently &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account , credit cards or credit cards .

a ban@@ ker said that , at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see , there is a cli@@ ent@@ ele which is a little more l@@ ush from the property . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a little bank for problem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they ski@@ pped for free . &quot; &quot; &quot;

destination records : who actually buys sound plates ?
lon@@ ely men of middle age love panels .
before joining the comm@@ it@@ eil , in order to over@@ se@@ eding him under the pseud@@ onym non @-@ rib@@ bon age of age , this statement is derived from current data .
according to You@@ go@@ v , it is not the most discussed re@@ building of sound plates on a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als that would like to welcome the re@@ jection of physical objects , but back to Mid@@ life @-@ Nost@@ al@@ gia .
those who recently bought a record are all fo@@ resi@@ ght according to the age between 45 and 54 .
indeed , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely buyer group .
it is also not a Hor@@ den by ho@@ b@@ by@@ ers - it has a emotional meaning : older record buyers will retain their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it alone time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but does the results vote by You@@ Go@@ v ?
if this blog would be a news report on TV , I would follow the camera , while I will keep my hands in the middle of a busy street in S@@ oh@@ o , before I stop my hands and keep something amazing like : &quot; so let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let us take a look at it .
even if the heart of So@@ H@@ os is slowly linked to its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once , independ@@ ant sellers have been located , there are as a hand@@ ful of fantastic record shops .
I would probably ask the camera program to turn off the camera for the next part , in which I am standing near to different men in such stores and try to assess your age and mind by observation .
Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , whom I am from S@@ ister Ray ( data number : two young women , three men of middle age ) in Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data number : eight men of middle age , a woman , probably around the 20 ) sequence is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates .
these record panels , above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I &apos;m not followed at home ) , clo@@ the walls of his living room .
the reason why he has such considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of his available income : it is now able to buy plates that he could not aff@@ ord to buy &#91; them &#93; and again objects , which he sold , when he sold young and comple@@ ite .
&quot; many things I buy , are from the late &apos; 60s , early &apos; 70s , which appeared , when I was 11 or 12 . things I probably was too young to buy them , &quot; says he .
it is true that those who buy boards , rather ch@@ ained and would like to spend some time , and adds : &quot; I smoke not , and I drink not much .
this is my sc@@ aster .
We@@ z , 25 , who works at S@@ ister Ray , believes that many customers who meets the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
however , he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the Medi@@ enh@@ pe , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and decided to buy their old records .
of the talks , which I have led , people usually have dispos@@ ed of their collection in 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs , now sell their CDs to buy themselves their records . &quot;
this would explain the boom on followers of a specific age .
but what about the inn@@ able emotional significance of sl@@ abs ?
it takes only a few seconds in a business like phon@@ ica to detect that record shops offers a soo@@ thing community of equality .
according to We@@ z , some of the previous clients participated in the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some disk fans will be overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to draw back to the stability of confi@@ ded sil@@ encer , from objects , the happ@@ en@@ vi@@ able vi@@ vi@@ ations .
&quot; I think , sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a void or property of poss@@ essions as a type of comfort , &quot; says We@@ z .
that &apos;s with me as a collector , and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to deal with spiritu@@ ally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social worker ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; killed one employee from a record stack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey of the IC@@ M in April reveal that almost 50 % of people who have bought a record has not yet been heard .
the survey also found that 41 % possess a turn@@ table that they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a plate , do not own record players .
at that point of the news report , I would like to look very wor@@ ried , while I blu@@ ish a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations through a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations .
J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works with sounds of the Uni@@ verse ( data number : three men of middle age ) has worked on a &quot; t@@ rophy of &quot; the Revi@@ val . &quot;
&quot; someone came only recently here and said , &quot; I have no record player , but I would like to buy them a radi@@ oh@@ ead sound plate , so I &apos;d like to set them into the shelf . &quot;
this is not a large percentage , but it &apos;s definitely happening .
more productive , less musi@@ cl@@ ing .
we have people who say : &quot; I have no record player . &quot;
those are younger people , not older , that come slowly .
opp that has been dedicated to the sound plates almost a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience , than I cle@@ ans .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teenagers and women of middle ages .
even if the atmosphere is slightly relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops , Wild Be@@ asts &apos;s latest Syn@@ thesis and right @-@ right pop instead of experimental jazz dr@@ ill@@ ers from the loudspeakers - is it good to see such diversity to the customers .
none of them sees strange indeed , but n@@ ag@@ ious trau@@ mat@@ a are hard to conc@@ ei@@ v@@ able , if one stands for about 30 seconds in addition to someone .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the business for some minutes and considered the vari@@ ability of the plates that are available for sale .
she rather makes a sh@@ utter bum@@ per in a big shopping .
it doesn &apos;t deser@@ ves much , therefore the Colle@@ cting of records are not a real option , says she .
it costs a lot .
it is easy to listen to music from a computer or to other way , but the beauty of sl@@ abs &apos; ... they drives with a sig@@ h sig@@ h .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it is truly unique .
my last stop is a store that is said that a new generation of record lovers have to be inspired : urban out@@ j@@ ig .
while I ad@@ mit to count the je@@ ans @-@ Hot@@ p@@ ants , I observe a group of young teen@@ ager who group@@ ed for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras , before a father and his daughter superior to buy a Cros@@ ley player .
on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of plates from Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ eh@@ ouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a blend of contemporary music and classics that are essential for an average collection .
no one sees her - perhaps because they are only purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to deal with them .
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
but considering that every attraction for these objects would mean more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of so@@ h@@ os for more , there is nothing to compl@@ ain about .
there is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , also the one that is most for luxury items such as plates .
even though my resear@@ ches showed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v would match them , at least in record shops in S@@ oh@@ o , the large number of female collectors and record facilities that exist in reality , business transactions and in On@@ line@@ for@@ ums .
these people probably work hard in school or offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with security in the cr@@ um@@ ble by record shops of the Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by sl@@ abs , while the star@@ red view of an unknown , 30 @-@ year @-@ old cre@@ ator mei@@ des that rises not over the shoul@@ ders men aged men .

French court ref@@ uses to demol@@ ition of shops in the jung@@ le refugee camp
a French court is rejected by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of vis@@ ional shops and restaurants in the jung@@ le of Cal@@ ais , where thousands of refugees live .
in case of hearing this week , the authorities argu@@ ed that the state should have jurisdiction to sell 72 temporary shops , sale of cigarettes to Energ@@ y@@ drinks , selling , hair@@ dressing services or tea for 50 cents ( 40 P@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais argu@@ ed that these places should be settled down because they would represent a parallel economy out of which no taxes would be paid and that a fire and risk of fire host@@ els .
humanitarian groups divided the court with that the shops and restaurants are important as the free meals that supported by the state @-@ supported union and other groups , do not provide sufficient foods for the growing numbers in the camp .
they went out that the vis@@ ional business and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there was no legal basis for the exp@@ ulsion of people who operate the 72 vis@@ ional business , but spati@@ ally disc@@ arded the concerns of Cal@@ ais pre@@ fecture . &quot;
the judge Jean François M@@ olla said that the food business , cafes and restaurants would play a lot more important role , than only people live , who live in extremely pre@@ valent conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas were quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places that was threatened by the decline was the young Book kids &apos; Café des camp , which is meant @-@ n@@ ered and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as guidance on asylum seek@@ ers , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the kids &apos; Café .
in a letter to the Guardian , it was the closure of the closure &quot; for those children of a cat@@ astrophe , of which the youngest eight years old are . &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement Trailer
Germany R@@ aser must be set to the next generation speed sensor : in various federal states , among other things in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new lightning tools are tested to be particularly effective .
the fut@@ ur@@ istic actual En@@ forcement trailer of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used as an example of accident , where it would be dangerous for mobile measurement using the police .
for example , on motorway construction sites or to san@@ itation bridges , there are no necessary infra@@ structures to ensure the speed lim@@ iter with a stationary leaf .
a more durable construction can be too dangerous or co@@ stly .
the En@@ forcement trailer is independent : its battery lasts five days with un@@ interrupted measurement mode , the case data will be transmitted via a modem .
using Laser Measurement Techni@@ ques , all vehicles can be captured simultaneously via several traces .
variable speed lim@@ it@@ ments , as well as driving license according to time , road strips and vehicle class can also be found .
in a high @-@ driven condition , the trailer can be reached according to the manufacturer with each car with trailer hit@@ ch .
with that he is not easy to sur@@ pass , it is lowered into measurement operations so that the wheels are cr@@ ushed in the pan@@ ze@@ es and van@@ ish un@@ certain outer cover .
furthermore , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter in front of v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to vit@@ ronic in various federal states and now also used .
foreign authorities also car@@ ve with the new technology : recently France has 100 pieces , after an order of 150 pieces last year .
great Britain brings silver in the 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by , after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold
the impressive performance of Britain at the 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by came in the final on Thursday evening at a rup@@ ting stop at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were beaten up with a score of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ od@@ oro Stadium in Rio .
Fi@@ ji gave a master class in the handling , Side @-@ Step@@ ping , After@@ back , liner and rock strength to win gold - their first Olympic champion every color .
the defeat was not very proud of the silver medal - Great Britain fourth on that day - and they could quite be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they struck New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the Bo@@ dies , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ final on the same day could fall in the final .
but independently of these , Fi@@ ji would have beaten a 15 @-@ man team in the shape .
it could be a comfort for GB - but it probably won &apos;t - that at least one Br@@ ite will have hanging a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is chef coach Ben R@@ yan , former head of England for Wimbledon .
GB had a difficult road behind it .
eight years ago she lost under R@@ yan every play on Adelaide Sev@@ ens .
here they lost one .
this can@@ opy becomes we@@ aving , but the progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji began ad@@ mi@@ red and made the GB@@ S attacks .
it felt at the Kapitän Tom Mitchell and Co. in driving . the World Series winner went 5 @-@ 0 to the top , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au arrived in the corner r@@ over@@ crow@@ ded .
with four minutes of playing time Jerry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack out of the right corner , which he converted .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly used the ball .
a third goal of Mitchell stops the mountain of Man Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to get a third goal but it has only stopped Fi@@ ji .
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a in the right corner is a touch down and it was 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the re @-@ start and there was still over one minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ Guatem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ v@@ ou developed a lot of weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB teams and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion carried a 29 @-@ 0 until the break .
it &apos;s like Fi@@ ji who was born to play 7 while the GB still learn .
so it is too .
UK introduced fundamental changes to the half @-@ time and ended the fi@@ ji@@ vian gap ... for a whole four minutes , which was good for the ratios of the first half @-@ period , until Joshua made Tu@@ is@@ ova according to a Br@@ illi@@ ant intermediate play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan Norton started an attempt on GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went long for the southern se@@ ein@@ ment , whose fans sang and d@@ anced at the grand@@ stand .
it was not hard to admire the play@@ site Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the i @-@ door with another attempt in the last seconds .
the pl@@ um@@ ff sounds , the Fi@@ j@@ is im@@ pover@@ ished and GB dis@@ closed down in the lawn .
earlier on the day Fi@@ ji Japan defeated in semi @-@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 defeated and Great Britain pushed South Africa in a close half match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s conversion of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ dies in the first half after the front , but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive foot@@ ing and scored a gate under the post in the second half .
a brilli@@ antly late Tac@@ oma of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side teams , assured the prize - and thus the silver medal .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the cancer of the train@@ ee as a rowing victory
there will be no emotional gold than with these games and that wants to be hot .
from the first rowing stroke to the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve , who go into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning were an additional significance in their golden moment at Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even if there were only those who were sitting at the ru@@ dder , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was all@@ present at the second Olympics in the two @-@ year @-@ old female without tax nurse , the first women in the history of British sports , who laid on such a scale .
their domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all of her 3@@ 9.@@ ed un@@ le@@ aking use , which is also exempl@@ ary .
what we see are two brilliant Athlet@@ es which reflects the surface with elegance of weak@@ nesses , which does not reflect the nature of the Arc de Tri@@ om@@ phe .
behind each gold in the ruins there is a batt@@ al@@ ion on content helping to make the difference , and there was no one more hil@@ ly than the coach that would not survive the difference 30 months ago , if he was diagnosed every day when he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said he ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer , the oper@@ able and so did it .
if you do not do this , he spreads out everywhere .
it would have been a pretty serious situation .
it doesn &apos;t change a bit .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio had luck that he could be treatment early in early 2014 , outside the season , could begin the inter@@ ruption to a minimum in case that is the right term under such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to go back soon .
it was a inc@@ en@@ tive .
I was in hospital and ran at the station around - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough .
it starts like that .
the rowing on itself is a challenge , but this makes it a bigger one .
in the in@@ fertil@@ ity of victory , their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a ner@@ ved morning to talk a little more than else , trying to process his own fears .
St@@ anning who was the captain of the Royal Art@@ illery Reg@@ iment in a deployment in Afghanistan , &quot; I was this week an emotional wreck . that &apos;s perhaps something extremely , but it means so much . &quot;
it is repeated , how much I mean , how much I and Helen and Robin have worked at this time .
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin , nobody would be no one , that &apos;s a massive Dan@@ ke to him . he is the best coach in the world .
I would have no better person for exercising or a better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have lost no race in the last five years .
the pair had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not survive .
even during the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to move up , the anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in the reserve .
we were very close at the moment .
Helen called &quot; lead in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important to let yourself be ri@@ pping .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not to do something of rab@@ ies .
we wanted to give today no fire@@ works , we wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race , what we did .
the couple will take a break before it will meet over his future .
Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding in their own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now , just want to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that my last race was .
that would have too much pressure .
in London it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
that feels so much better , &quot; she said .
for 31 years the exempl@@ ary for clarity
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Managing Director of the water @-@ purpose &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ eit@@ ful &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; R@@ upper@@ t G@@ öller , retired . &quot; &quot; &quot;

a small fr@@ ame@@ ful drinking water system as a model for the large water producer .
in this way , there was some time ago in the original music in a post by Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk .
little later , the Water Forum in the Government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia became the purpose of the purpose .
the work of the V@@ eit@@ ful Group sailed &quot; Bavaria far as exempl@@ ary . &quot;
behind all this , Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who had been working for 31 years , became the managing director for 28 years .
now he was retired at the age of 65 .

member states are the congregations church , Breit@@ brun@@ n , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
for further cities and municipalities there are water supplier agreements .
the current chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was hired as a water level in 1985 and was appointed Chief Executive Officer of the purpose of the purpose of the purpose of purpose .
&quot; its tasks are very varied and they extended from the water @-@ line construction and maintenance activities , the budget production , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency inserts at weekends , &quot; said the chair .
as outstanding events she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , the property in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the reconstruction of the flood control ( 1999 ) , the new creation of a central computer controller ( 2004 ) and the sub@@ scriptions of water lines .
I have not given any stand@@ still , and I &apos;ve always recorded innovations , because there is water life , and drinking water the most important food .
in its Lau@@ d@@ ati@@ o they praised g@@ mer@@ cen@@ aries , reliable and correct service over 31 years .
he has worked with a lot of heart bl@@ iss for his purpose @-@ purpose , and he lived on a regular basis as his own company .
a few weeks ago , he served as a real practition@@ er to present the concept of the V@@ eit@@ ful Group in front of the water forum of the district Unter@@ fran@@ ken .
he received very much recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller &apos;s right hi@@ ps Alf@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him 28 years with him .
he is the best water level and he was a loy@@ al Kn@@ appe .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as a highlights from its point of view , he called the Brun@@ nen@@ bau and the restructuring of the purpose of its purpose .
the biggest challenge and most difficult usage , however , the pi@@ ping on high @-@ reservoir at the church was finished on a 3rd January .
here , at minus 17 degrees the whole night you had to pass through , so the villages with water could be looked after .
even the supply of Neu@@ brun@@ n one can only be reck@@ oned only because you filled the sky@@ tank of P@@ ett@@ stadt with sl@@ abs .

steel - light overview for German steel industry
the cra@@ ck @-@ explo@@ ited and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed at an additional cost in Milli@@ onen@@ ess .
financial stress , which the industry origin@@ ate from the green electricity production , are from the table .
it remain with the liberation of the renewable energies environment for the so @-@ called energy production in the German steel industry , Federal Minister for Federal Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , said the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m really glad that we were able to reach negotiations after two years &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the European Commission , the European Commission initially planned to insert steel manufacturers to demand the gases from the High @-@ furnace for power for use in the cas@@ hier .
according to the German industry sector , the steel industry reached additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel told the WA@@ Z , it has been a basic certificate with the EU Commission after talks with competition miss@@ ile Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when generators in steel units are replaced , all an EEG donation of 20 percent .
but this will not be raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall sal@@ uted the agreement of Germany with the EU Commission for own power generation .
this means that the status Quo was largely determined .
special meaning has the successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our Campa@@ ign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the future is the first step &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; more must follow &quot; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even at the reform of mit@@ igation are climate and employment targets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated IG Metall @-@ CEO Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry has been suffering from over@@ capacity and considerable pricing pressure .
last year , the situation continues to decline as the world &apos;s largest producer in China in view of the weaker demand of demand mass@@ ac@@ red on the global market .
European manufacturers cast a Chinese steel group price j@@ umping .
during this spring the situation has been relaxed .
as a show , imports of imports on imported effects , on the other hand , the economic prospects in China are getting brigh@@ tened .
not clear how sustainable the price recovery is .
on Thursday the German industry prim@@ us Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp stayed on Thursday .
recently the prices would be stag@@ n@@ ated .
the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp re@@ iter@@ ate not to exclu@@ de the closure of individual works .
at the end of 2015 around 86@@ ,000 people were employed in the German steel industry .
in July , German steel manufacturers remain c@@ auti@@ ous in spite of rising prices and increasing orders .
they produced a good six percent less cru@@ de steel than in the previous year , as compared to the economic re@@ unification of the year on Friday .
after a brief increase in May , the produced quantity returned to the second month in a row .
since the beginning of the year , production is reduced by two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
the association anticip@@ ates improved emissions in the coming months , thanks to an improved order situation .
community , spirit , health : singing and seniors well
the S@@ ingen has accompanied her whole life : as a young girl , she was in the school@@ choir , in the teaching position she finished the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a senior senior choir .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; singing and physical , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she moves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after one rehear@@ sal it feels balanced , che@@ er@@ ful and a total of alive , she says .
by side , her health and her spirit pract@@ ises something good .
for singing is like from several perspectives : a great hobby for seniors , says Erhard Hac@@ kler from the German senior liga .
most senior students sing together in ch@@ orus , and share the joy in music , describes Hac@@ kler .
through regular interaction , senior business contacts can take up and maintain .
because often , social and family structures in the age on , a ch@@ orus is then an ideal place to spend time with other people .
this experience has also made Ur@@ sel K@@ ipp in her choir : &quot; to arrange and organize , to be able to leave and learn from each other - a choir is a very special shape of consciousness . &quot;
it is possible to sing in the positive sense , h@@ ors h@@ unters .
senior citizens exercise a deep and controlled re@@ spiration .
those who demands his lungs are regularly challenged , which is not as fast as fast in everyday life .
even if it comes to get the sound of the voice at age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hobby .
on older people S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Urs@@ ula L@@ enz from the German labour community of the seniors @-@ organisations .
in the older generations , the common s@@ ingen had a much higher score , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and free time , explains them .
L@@ enz is often observed that singing or listening of songs in older people have we@@ ar@@ ous@@ ed many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth time .
by lyrics and especially mel@@ ody apart from lyrics , people are ab@@ orted by themselves in a long time of events .
when singing the head , a special output is required , L@@ enz is explained .
at the same time , focusing on their own voice and to a given rhythm and to adapt to other singers - this is a major cogn@@ itive challenge .
just older people who live alone , do not practice , do not only concentrate on itself .
another positive aspect is the recognition of which one goes through the singing in ch@@ orus , h@@ ates Hac@@ kler .
a thr@@ illed audience is a great praise .
even the self @-@ est@@ e@@ em is growing by the singing in ch@@ orus .
themselves to show itself : if I am long for something , I will get better and watch over me - this experience strengthens .
good reasons to start with singing , so there is enough .
those who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he think , little talent , may be av@@ eng@@ ed .
you don &apos;t sings alone - at 50 singing people who list@@ ens on , if a tone is next to it ?
looking for the appropriate offer , Sen@@ iors have various possibilities , says Hac@@ kler .
someone sings from the acquain@@ t@@ ance circuit in an ic@@ ro@@ ench@@ y@@ or , you can simply connect it .
many cities offer over@@ views over the choirs in the area .
who wants to sing in a church choir may turn right to the church or church leaders .
many senior st@@ ats can also be found on the internet .
anyone does not have access to the internet , the family , friends or neighbours must ask help for Internet computers .
anyone who wants to sing , shou@@ ldn &apos;t join a ch@@ orus , h@@ ates Hac@@ kler .
singing does the soul well and has something Be@@ fre@@ ien@@ des - this is true for every age .
cats react sensiti@@ vely than cal@@ dera over k@@ itt@@ ens of the young k@@ itt@@ ens
Bi@@ ologists have examined in Hanover , which effect the ru@@ bs of Kat@@ zen@@ bab@@ ys have grown up to adult animals .
in her surprise the Mi@@ th@@ ole did not get cold , but , however , in contrast to the female always felt the same .
female cats may recogn@@ ise the exc@@ itement of cat@@ zen@@ bab@@ ys at the Mi@@ th@@ iev@@ es of the little ones .
they react to ten percent faster on l@@ ute by k@@ itt@@ ens who chose themselves in great ad@@ versity , as scientists from the medical doctor and the Medical School of Hannover ( MH@@ H ) have found .
boy also respond to the k@@ itt@@ ens of k@@ itt@@ ens - but always equal .
&quot; evi@@ d@@ ently the acoustic differences between the Mi@@ th@@ i of less and strongly stim@@ ulated young ones for the males either perceived or not of meaning , &quot; Bi@@ olog@@ y@@ Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the MH@@ H said .
it is first authorized in the study published by this Friday in the magazine &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ u@@ pp@@ Biology . &quot;
in a previous examination , the research team had already found that the duration and sound height of the k@@ itt@@ ens cry with the ur@@ ality of their help needy .
a total of nine adult males and eight boxes were observed from the Shel@@ ter of the MH@@ H .
they were played for a rowing of little ones , taken for three minutes from the litter box and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
at the other , they were con@@ fron@@ ted with cry from stronger che@@ bs which were additionally up@@ lifted .
the researchers keep their results despite the small sample for sa@@ wn .
&quot; all females , even those who had no own offspring , responded to the cry , &quot; said Con@@ er@@ ding .
it turned faster to the speakers when this ru@@ fe played the very rainy k@@ itt@@ ens .
this ability may be an@@ odi@@ zed or developed with the sexually mature .
&quot; one surprise was that the male respon@@ ds at all , &quot; said the Bi@@ ologist . &quot;
in the past scientists have already examined several times when people examined the reactions of women and men in baby soil .
also some studies showed that women will be sensitive to babies , very equal if they were already mothers or not , the Bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ ung@@ ann reported .
Po@@ dol@@ ski p@@ ens with &quot; gala &quot; to Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
in Turkey against the single football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver was issued an arrest warrant .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
an important soccer game for the first time after the coup attempt in Turkey .
prior to the du@@ el of the Erz@@ ri@@ vals between Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as Istanbul and Luke Po@@ dol@@ skis Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul in the opening of the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual . &quot;
already on the suspension of acceptance according to the overthrow in July , the government , the daily life of normal brush@@ ing should not be imp@@ aired .
however , this does not apply to those suspected , to be suspected of the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the coup attempt .
it is not done in front of the football .
against the former Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver , the Prosec@@ ution filed an arrest warrant .
according to this , he is accused of being living in the South America in the South America , a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ ver is supposed to be the supporters of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the coup attempt by President Recep Tayyip Erd@@ og@@ an .
although the exceptional result is valid for 90 days , even until October , actually the life of the Turks had the life of most Turks , but as good as no effect .
the n@@ igh@@ tly n@@ igh@@ tly &quot; democracy @-@ gu@@ ards &quot; on public places throughout the country has declared Erd@@ og@@ an on Wednesday for completion .
the sports is - like the whole country - split into charm and opponents of the planet earth .
especially fans of the Workers club Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as did not count towards the friends of the President .
but what the Turks occupied by the Turks in view of dramatic experiences in history is the strict re@@ jection of military coup .
there are even the fans - no matter whether their heart beats Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at Pok@@ al@@ winner &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will be arriving at Lukas Po@@ dol@@ sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his sporty value presented its sporty value in the past season : with 17 gates and nine templates , the 31 year old finished his first playing time as a top@@ sc@@ orer of his association .
in the final match against F@@ ener@@ b@@ ah@@ ce he achieved the 1 : 0 victory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fan@@ atics &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asked him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He was the best in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he finished the season at an excellent way and secured the cup .
thanks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; found a dis@@ appo@@ inting season for the record champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the pre @-@ round K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; came out early in the Europe League .
in the South of Li@@ g there was only to rank six .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we did it and this is the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as the game year was better .
thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , the base of the 14 season hits the base to the 14th title , with 26 seasonal figures .
this is the reason that the fans continued to return to the return of the 31 year old .
at the AC Florence , under the Treaty and Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as , he had only announced expl@@ or@@ ating Gom@@ ez after the coup attempt to return to the country &apos;s political situation in the country after his EM @-@ holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario want to come to us , he must only say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cited the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ icker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Club@@ man F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , this stri@@ ker would have to be willing to abst@@ ain from roughly one @-@ third of its valued at 7.5 million euros to ren@@ ounce the yearly sal@@ inity , put Or@@ man clear : &quot; its salary at Florence can we do not pay . &quot;
despite d@@ oping : these athletes still have medals opportunities at Olympia in Rio
the 34 year old Just@@ in Gat@@ lin was closed twice for D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ owa cannot start in Rio .
other over@@ took Athlet@@ ics sin@@ ner can only laugh about them - they are fighting in Rio about medals .
the topic of d@@ oping was destined according to the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics Games .
the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ owa , who had lam@@ inated in a d@@ oping lock her starting right shortly before playing , was stopped at its start ( 100 meters of chest ) fun and hat@@ ching off .
it was a sk@@ ur@@ r@@ ile Sz@@ ener@@ ie : with a finished smile , it was still proud in the hall and prov@@ oked with their appearance .
when noted that they won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out in a sh@@ out tower .
but there are many other sport@@ s@@ men who go to the start despite d@@ oping past in Rio Olympics .
here is an overview :
Just@@ in Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old belongs to the controversi@@ al figures in the field of athlet@@ ics .
he had been blocked for D@@ op@@ ings for two times ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
since his debut , the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion is even faster than before , it is over 100 m in 9,@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered the greatest challenge of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / Jamaica ) : the second @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to sit a six @-@ month sperm , after you have proven the pain by Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
after an operation , she had severe tooth pain , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old def@@ ending .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the 2012 Olympic champion of the world champion in 2013 and the European champion from 2010 to 2016 were positive on the forbidden stim@@ ul@@ ant of meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine .
Per@@ kovic denied the final taking and was punished for six months .
the four longest lit@@ ters in this year go to the account of big gold f@@ ath@@ ite .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympics and two times world champion about 400 m was closed in 2010 and was closed to 21 months .
a means for penis enlargement would have been responsible , emphas@@ ised Mer@@ ritt .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 m of the world &apos;s fastest man in the world .
Ivan Ti@@ ch@@ on ( Hammer@@ smith , Belarus ) : probably hardly any athletes have been recognized as many medals .
so , Ti@@ ch@@ on lost his championship title in 2005 nine years later , after testing a test@@ osterone intelligence d@@ oping .
in addition , the 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to leave Olympia @-@ Silver in 2004 because of ster@@ oid D@@ op@@ ings and EM @-@ Title 2006 because of test@@ osterone and abuse .
he received the recognized bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games in 2008 , due to a judgment of the International Sports Tribunal .
with 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he is ranked 3rd in the World Ran@@ kings .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world record and gold f@@ ath@@ it@@ in was first tested in May , but may still start in Rio .
at the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , critics were found on taking a forbidden food supplement which fell victim to the world &apos;s anti @-@ d@@ oping agency WA@@ DA , mil@@ dly and ran already on 13 July .
bomb error in Thailand - Austri@@ ans viol@@ ated - several dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand stand in contact with the woman in contact , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ öll , Friday .
they had been taken by cutting and had been treated in hospital , but I have already left this again .
for their home trip they are planned for the beginning of September .
whether the further explo@@ sions on holiday island Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ phe are also affected by Austrian citizens , be still un@@ clear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are related to the local authorities as well as the local authorities .
in some 200 kilometres south of the capital of Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in were first explo@@ ded on Thursday evening in a excav@@ ation area of two bombs .
according to the police , a market of Thailand had been killed and about 20 people were injured , among them the Austri@@ ans , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday morning again two jumps ended up again , and there was another human being killed according to the authorities .
even by Ph@@ u@@ ket , a bomb explosion was reported in the morning .
in the Det@@ onation near the popular bathing train Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured as a taxi driver .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani in the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded that a municipal people killed .
according to the authorities , the explo@@ si@@ onal rough@@ ts had gone into the air in front of the Re@@ four of the coastal police .
finally , det@@ on@@ ations requested in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g at the south @-@ west coast and in Ch@@ om@@ phe on the south @-@ east coast several injured .
they go from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , named it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bomb attacks bear the same manuscript , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said army @-@ ener@@ al Dan@@ ai Lep@@ meth@@ av@@ ee fri@@ day before journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect it to be a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was too early to vo@@ irs up to possible mot@@ ives - probably it would do , however , around the acts of Muslim reb@@ els .
even Thai media wanted to recogn@@ ise a pattern , which is typical for the bomb attacks in the south of the country .
the Thai police , however , declared that the terrorist attacks were not related to the Islam@@ ist insur@@ gency movement , or with the international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local Sab@@ ot@@ age , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should rather be sure that the bombs were taken by the ruling of the ruling military j@@ unta .
the authorities received confi@@ dential references in the South of the country during the last days - but they don &apos;t have been informed about the exact time and the locations .
yet be un@@ clear , which group is behind the attacks .
the police arrested its officials to enhance security around important government buildings as well as airports , stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and am@@ us@@ ement district .
in Thailand there are smaller bomb attacks , but they usually do not judge for tourists .
Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used by King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j over the years of Thailand .
on his homepage , the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends the Austrian Foreign Ministry on his homepage to ensure the instructions of Thai safety agencies .
high security risk ( security level 3 ) , for the provinces of Nar@@ c@@ iw@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and its surroundings .
according to the disp@@ utes between security forces and Muslim populations , they are not necessary to use these provinces in these provinces .
increased safety risk ( security level 2 ) sailed for the rest of the country .
a few days after a controversi@@ al referendum on Thursday and Friday , a referendum on Thursday and Friday took place .
this spatial influence of the military influence also in the next few years .
Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ CH@@ A said that bombs be an attempt to sti@@ ff chaos while the country toward stability , improving economic situation and tourism .
the military coup , which had taken power in 2014 after a phase of blu@@ ish un@@ rest , keeps himself to the kingdom again to have stability and order .
however , the military has not succeeded in order to get the handle in the extreme south of the country for years in the extreme south of the country .
in the conflict more than 6500 people have been killed .
almost one year ago in Bangkok at a stop in a popular Hin@@ du @-@ shr@@ ine 20 people were killed - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloody stop of the younger history of the country .
the Rights &quot; Ident@@ it@@ ological Movement &quot; is at the Vis@@ ier of the Federal Office for Constitutional protection .
after several provincial ministers , the Constitutional Court have also set the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we look at the &apos; Ident@@ ity Movement &apos; An@@ ak points for asp@@ ir@@ ations against the freedom of democratic basic rules , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Constitutional protection Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate of the German Press Agency in Berlin &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so many other Islamic faith , or from the Middle East are diff@@ used in extrem@@ ist manner .
therefore we watch the movement too .
the &quot; Ident@@ ity movement &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she turns against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Multi@@ ple@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immig@@ ration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loss of own identity by over@@ time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the constitutional provisions of nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thuring@@ ia - observe the &quot; Ident@@ ities &quot; already .
Ma@@ ate said , his authority agreed to close by the country &apos;s decision .
&quot; groups like the &apos; Ident@@ ity movement &apos; attempt to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; said the constitutional protection .
generally , extrem@@ ists are attemp@@ ting to arrange them with a you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ iger music .
the Islamic Islam@@ ists as as right @-@ wing extre@@ mes .
this is not a com@@ mitting advertising for your own thing .
the prop@@ aganda threat is supposed to be emotional .
young people are due in particular way .
that is dangerous .
it was last given from several federal states reports on contacts of the &quot; Ident@@ ity &quot; to Af@@ D policy .
Ma@@ ate told , that he did not know any in@@ sights .
for the constitutional protection , potential contacts of this species be relevant only from a certain point .
it comes to whether the respective party - in this case the Mand@@ D - by certain people , the extrem@@ ist are changing , its target direction changes and then extrem@@ ist .
thus crucial is , if such persons control the party &apos;s influence on the party .
this is not recogni@@ z@@ able .
with a look at the mark@@ edly increase of legal negoti@@ ates and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee quot@@ ations , Ma@@ ate , he would not talk about new rights of terrorism .
but we found in the past few years that it may be right @-@ terrorism structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Friday Group .
it may be possible that further tim@@ es@@ cal@@ ist group@@ ings or small groups constitute the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee families or attacks from other right @-@ wing moti@@ fs .
however , a German @-@ wide or European control of legal terrorism may not be recogni@@ z@@ able .
the present groups were originated at the regional level or in social networks .
wor@@ ried about how many survi@@ vors were interested to the account of people who had not entered the right scene previously in the right scene .
this is the al@@ ous@@ ed .
many of the susp@@ ects in attacks on asylum seek@@ ers are not known as crimin@@ als , polit@@ ically motiv@@ ated criminal off@@ ender or tra@@ ilers of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people have committed criminal off@@ ences , who were not polit@@ ically in@@ different at the time of right , which were perhaps polit@@ ically in@@ different , or for instance CDU , SPD or Lin@@ ke , who have been elected to the right @-@ right mood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te will become the Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
the Olympi@@ ad or world records are not always determine the head@@ lines of the Olympic Games .
this shows the bra@@ ve appearance of RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the easily exc@@ essive s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia is so slow that it was no longer visible in the TV pictures .
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the section was selected .
in the social networks , Hab@@ te was then inter@@ ne@@ yed to vir@@ al inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended with a return of 48 seconds and took the 59@@ th place of 59 starters .
but it was rather his not even spor@@ tive figure that moved the attention of international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old took part in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special issue on the international swimming band .
this will spread to swim in sub@@ divided countries .
since A@@ th@@ op@@ ies running most athletes , Hab@@ te just wanted to do something else .
preparation is all : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first sur@@ names made the round .
some media recorded him as &quot; RO@@ B@@ EL of the W@@ al . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in response to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prosper@@ ity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the English Bou@@ lev@@ ard@@ leaf &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was fun with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he defeated only with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters of Fre@@ estyle , played there no role .
compare with &quot; Eric the E@@ EL &quot; were also drawn .
on the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney the run by Eric Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i used for medi@@ al attention .
memor@@ able , the appearance of the swimming pool from A@@ qu@@ ator@@ ial Guinea , when he had to compete in a run over 100 meters of Fre@@ estyle alone .
fr@@ en@@ et@@ ical was fired at Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i at that time .
the then 22 @-@ year @-@ old lear@@ nt to swim eight months before the Olympia and had never completed a long distance before the competition .

with the election to the U.S. President , Donald Tr@@ ump has already been an alternative video .

when Donald Tr@@ ump loses the US presidential elections in November , it would be either open , or I have a very , very nice , long holiday , &quot; said the candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in a telephone interview with the US TV station CN@@ BC .
if it is not rich for him at the end for reasons of political correc@@ t@@ ness , it was fine , said Tr@@ ump .
thus he received the U.S. President Barack Obama and the candidates in Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist mil@@ itia Islamic State ( IS ) .
most recently , within its party , more resistance changed .

the consumer research company GfK showed his head Matthias Hartmann .
the back@@ ing came suddenly - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the market research company GfK showed that the chair by Prime Minister Matthias Hartmann will remain un@@ certain , the longer which has been promised by him .

Mr. Hartmann became the GfK International since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fruits of the restructuring are still not visible even after 5 years &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the last poor GfK and business figures , any applicant would be sometimes un@@ quiet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it would be at the BMW &apos;s case , this would also make the quot@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

crash@@ es - Bus sli@@ ps in cr@@ um@@ m@@ ir@@ n in tr@@ ench : eight injured
an accident of a travel agent with 43 senior citizens and passengers are injured daily at Kr@@ um@@ m@@ ir@@ n ( County Aur@@ ich ) eight people .
two of the occup@@ ants suffered severe injury , shared the police .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to move according to their data according to a opposite L@@ aster that drove in the counter @-@ way train .
the bus came to the right from the road and sli@@ pped into a tr@@ ench , like a spokes@@ person on the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus , the persons could not rely on the bus , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire brig@@ ade liberated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ance and an emergency transport came to the accident on the state road 2 .
the final rice end were brought back by a liner bus to the m@@ um@@ m@@ onal neighborhood P@@ ew@@ sum .
you should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators called on the lor@@ ds and potential witnesses to report to the police .
the fees per cubic metre of waste water are from 1 October 2016 for the area of se@@ wer@@ age Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ den@@ d@@ ahl 3,@@ 44 instead of 2,@@ 10 Euro ; for Zul@@ te berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3,@@ 36 Euro ( so far 2.@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 Euro ( so far 2.@@ 18 Euro ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the wer@@ age fee will increase again by then , if necessary improvement measures are necessary .
according to a relevant calculation , the wast@@ ew@@ ater price in Az@@ endorf will then be 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , the budget of the budget was determined by the budget of the estate with Kul@@ mb@@ ach to run for these san@@ itation systems .
the market Kas@@ endorf would be oblig@@ ated due to legal foundations , to operate the equipment .
as of October 1 , 2016 citizens as well as the industrial companies and industrial companies from World Con@@ ven@@ dors , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg deeper into the pur@@ se .
the introduc@@ tory increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as administrative manager Herbert Schmidt was shown to the panel , a new cal@@ ulation of fees for se@@ wer@@ age systems was necessary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 also over@@ - and sub@@ mar@@ es from the previous calendar period will be compens@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the engraved con@@ flu@@ ent increases , so that there are relatively small facilities in all three se@@ wage plants with a very low wage fall , which fly between 6@@ 800 and 12000 cubic meters per year .
thus , due to the low distribution basis , for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would effect .
the se@@ wer@@ age in all three plants is slightly decl@@ ining .
continue in the rec@@ eding calendar period for all three plants , not least due to their age remedi@@ ation and repair expenses in a considerable extent .
the plant in Az@@ endorf was nearly 30 years old , the facilities for the Car@@ rier , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth , Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp for almost 20 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt showed that in the waste water plant Az@@ endorf the mechanical ventilation system had to be exchanged due to a loss of pollut@@ ants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the p@@ umping pupp@@ ets the nearly 20 year @-@ old conveying equipment had to be over@@ taken and during the pond water treatment L@@ opp had to be dischar@@ ged after almost 20 years of operation , the sm@@ ud@@ ge is dispos@@ ed and an additional ventil@@ ating option to be installed in the future .
Schmidt : &quot; to these extraordinary expend@@ itures , the legal care and maintenance costs came into account according to the new calendar period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs which remained clearly below the current level during the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; stone houses made clear that the expenses for the operation and maintenance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the Schmidt , the market community of large entertainment will have been spar@@ ed for se@@ wer@@ age areas over the past 20 years .
the situation for the af@@ ore@@ mentioned systems will continue to remain pre@@ valent , especially since you can &apos;t expand the supply area of the waste water association Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ acht@@ al to expand this plants , because it is a deficit facilities .

Snap@@ chat &quot; An@@ ime &quot; effect as Asian car@@ ic@@ ature
Snap@@ chat says that this filter is inspired , but some ob@@ servers say that there is un@@ sensitive to breeds .
with its filter tool , this chat allows for about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with ident@@ ities on such a way that borders the ab@@ sur@@ d .
you can turn into one p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are inde@@ xed , in@@ trin@@ sic tool rot@@ ational tools that generate more than 30 million improved sel@@ ec@@ tively per day .
all flaws were to be opened to the public .
Snap@@ chat filters have moved in the past review in which they were accused of being accused of cap@@ turing the Black@@ face mask or white skin as a beauty deal .
when this week caused a filter to a filter that gave them battles , false teeth and imm@@ or@@ ated che@@ eks , they called some critics a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; white light . &quot;
they asked whether these repet@@ itive contro@@ vers@@ es asked to a larger problem that the company has di@@ vers@@ ität .
the news and the Emp@@ ör@@ ung were dis@@ sem@@ inated on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and motherboard to tell a day after Snap@@ chat that it would have been de@@ activated .
the company offered an exc@@ use : the filter was for homage to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but exterior , the R@@ ass@@ is@@ sm@@ us have experienced , remin@@ ded the filters of the c@@ lich@@ és .
others rejected the anim@@ e comparison .
in an e @-@ mail , grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani wrote a Korean American research student whose hands were widespread over the photos that the filter was in@@ viol@@ ently and was said un@@ pleasant . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to ar@@ gue with the opposite position of a very resist@@ ible Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ protected , but that the yel@@ lowing of the yellow flower was moved .
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that this cultural Stol@@ per@@ dra@@ fted crosses .
the American culture seems to be wrapped in an endless diversity and integ@@ rating amp@@ f , from conference rooms up to Hollywood and the devices that we all keep in their hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats large audience of young people - who are active in the race , more than their older opponents , could expect to expect bo@@ si@@ vity .
when one of snap@@ shots filters a picture is created , &quot; so it is much more difficult to remember that such things were un@@ noticed , &quot; the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Zh@@ u said in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday , Zh@@ u decided to have been working as a product manager and engineer for media , to delete their Snap@@ chat account , others asked to do the same .
in an ess@@ ay for medium and in a telephone interview they said that they believe that r@@ ent@@ ally @-@ related contro@@ vers@@ aw a lack of diversity in the not@@ ary practices in Snap@@ chat .
Zh@@ u critic@@ ised the big part white , just male leadership and ended their ess@@ ay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either have they no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their staff , so that they can meet such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Zh@@ u , &quot; or they are people with other skin colors that work there , but not in positions , in which they are safe or feel good , in order to say anything about it . &quot;
others share their opinion , an appeal to the Snap@@ chat has dropped largely un@@ answered .
the Company does not publish figures to di@@ ver@@ ity of his workforce and points to its status as a private company .
on Thursday , it refused to discuss the cultural back@@ grounds of his staff , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company has recently set a staff responsible , focusing on population groups and on internal integration elements .
Zh@@ u said that she will be closed to her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more user like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
military war@@ fare IS@@ IS Secret Services Information , establishes Committee of Congress
the United States Central Command at the United States Central Command Chang@@ es more detailed information to record an optim@@ istic image of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than they had allowed the actual conditions on site in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Armed Forces of the Armed Services Committee , reported of great dis@@ satisfaction at Central Command Secret Services , reported that reported their estim@@ ations to the US efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
central Command , short C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; News &quot; by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com Commander , who were typically examined by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com Commander in terrorism , as it had allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other news services , &quot; quoted a newspaper article published .
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses will be presented to our political leaders , &quot; Ken Cal@@ ver@@ t , republi@@ can Member of the House of Represent@@ atives , will be un@@ acceptable .
the guide errors in Cent@@ Com range up to the top point of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report presents detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in descriptions and analyses of the U.S. efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
although there are no direct hin@@ ts that government pointed to Obama are given to change the reports , it shows how anal@@ ysts were exposed to the pressure of its prec@@ urs@@ ing , an optimized image of the threat of Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or I@@ si@@ l .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , opinions and statements before the Congress were clearly positive than that of the facts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presented the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ Com Association announced publicly known that a military retreat could start in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , second @-@ second city of Iraq , remains under the control of Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigations , it is much clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Congress of Kansas , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of the year 2014 until the middle of the year 2015 , the tips of Central Command changes the post @-@ based opinions for watching the danger of IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Republi@@ can call the Task Force in life after them has been used to worry about the manip@@ ulation of reports from the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings during the investigation .
in addition , further investigations of Cent@@ Com reports from the general inspec@@ torate of the Ministry of Defense in the G@@ ange .
the Democratic Members of the news services published on Thursday their own findings , with some of the conclusions of Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com created a super@@ bly reduced trial for the creation of retro@@ fitting ass@@ ess@@ ments to I@@ si@@ l and the Iraqi security services &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the highest Democrat Democrats in the Com@@ intern , Member of the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. Schiff , announced in an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this process , as Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the publication of downstream items , &quot; the mor@@ ality among anal@@ ysts and &quot; gave a little space for different views . &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats agreed to have no references to an intervention of the White House at Cent@@ Com Anal@@ ysts &quot; as regards a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the proceedings of the Congress were published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August the New York Times reported investigations by the general inspec@@ torate of the Pentagon , which were taken after complaints by Cent@@ Com Anal@@ ysts .
Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a press pre@@ acher of the Pentagon , gave a statement in the opinion that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the Congress while the proceedings of the Colonel General Meeting were still in the swing .
but he also announced that &quot; experts sometimes could quite di@@ verg@@ ent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that the news services and the Ministry of Defence welcomed a controversi@@ al discussion of these important topics of national defence . &quot;
the investigations have the impact of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim that is now made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
however , the alleg@@ ations of the past year , however , was subject to the question that President Obama can rely on the Central Command for hon@@ our@@ able income for military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism of the Islamic State remin@@ ders of the Islamic State of more than ten years ago as an Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , a written statement about how the then government under George W. Bush met only a small crew of troops in Iraq and some time insi@@ sted on the consequences of the invasion of 2003 thoughts .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker played a key role in the insur@@ rection against the current reporting on the Islamic State .
last year , the team asked Mr. Hoo@@ ker on the indication of government agencies that had received no significant effects on the financial situation of the terrorist group , since these vis@@ ional refin@@ eries were put into operation in order to sell oil on the Black@@ market .
however , this knowledge was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the Legislative Council for its over@@ ty positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
General Austin went into retirement in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the United States win fourth match in the field @-@ hockey team , a show@@ down with the UK before
one day after they had shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ck@@ pe@@ y@@ team of women in a match against India that they won the Americans with 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually be a memor@@ able performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said they could not remember it that ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I am not aware of the people who keep their gates in memory .
however , this doesn &apos;t know : the Americans are 4 @-@ 0 in the olymp@@ ic competition and are equally unbe@@ aten in their group with the British in the first place that remains unbe@@ aten in their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet in the last game of the first round in the last game .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ finals , the game will decide which the two teams hit the first and second place in their group .
the first @-@ place fin@@ ishers will take a little bit longer from the route , which will lead the other group .
as always the game is going out on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising way through their success story , four years after they landed at the last London Games in the past 12 squares .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania on , and had the first time with three years a hockey team in their hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
it missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 , since it was not able to qualify for the cad@@ re .
then came the year 2012 , where she and her team went off all .
in the following year , Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , a Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the national team , and thus began to turn the things for better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cultural change , an ment@@ ary change and a physical change , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had not the work ens@@ er in London , which we have now .
we can rip the ru@@ der completely .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the tor@@ ches in the first half of the game with a return blow from the se@@ am area .
India had gone without victory in the tournament , but the team did sur@@ pris@@ ingly tough and held the game status from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter to B@@ am the game in their hands .
it carried out a spr@@ int with a flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved into the middle and air@@ way up the ball to the Americans to create a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the door@@ ke@@ over of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had to make a goal in each of the previous games .
she has a run .
same as b@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will take the result of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
located in the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the ol@@ ines of the tramp@@ ol@@ ines
wherever you are too late , it is the Olympic Games too .
the events in Rio de Janeiro will be stable and invisible to the sh@@ av@@ ant seasons between competition and Stre@@ ets .
it is , when the Olympic F@@ ack@@ el is a burning rod , which is from the bra@@ id to s@@ wimm@@ ers to the sole of the tri@@ athletes .
you cannot listen to the TV , read a newspaper or listen to the talk of your neighbours in the qu@@ eu@@ e in Coff@@ es@@ hop , without hearing from Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the dispute between Michael Ph@@ el@@ ps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there are Logan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s black with dimples , would have definitely be sent to Prime Time , build by sponsors and well @-@ being @-@ being @-@ advertising when he would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , Turner or even F@@ ever .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , is fought in the Olympic tr@@ ol@@ ines around gold .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event alike .
further from the centre , partly in the shade there are sports , which are not generally accepted : air guns shoot , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ w@@ ondo .
we will always have the chest swimming and may have it long .
but if I have modest arguments for my specific car@@ ling , let me make the attention of the discre@@ et charm of the tramp@@ ol@@ ines .
although the tr@@ amp @-@ jump has been an Olympic event since 2000 when it had made his debut in Sydney , it was the last 16 years so many that I had asked , did not know that there is an Olympic sport .
this could also be regional Ig@@ nor@@ anz .
although the United States won a contest for the competition , it has never gained a medal in the tr@@ amp @-@ jump , and by 2012 it has had a athl@@ ete until end @-@ round .
the Chinese and Russians tend to share the prizes for the men and the Chinese and the Canadian for the women .
Dong Dong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ on from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
the tr@@ amp @-@ jump has a certain outer side of side , partially because it sounds for the un@@ explained ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school than those for the Olympic Games .
at that point I should ad@@ mit that I &apos;m not an expert , but only a second enthusi@@ ast .
it has hum@@ or@@ ist@@ ically potential - the cart@@ o@@ on@@ ous cit@@ ations of his never to s@@ wollen im@@ pr@@ it - but also the gra@@ zie of the gym and diving , the two sports that combines it essentially .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means a lot like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; j@@ umping board &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the winner jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot nearly up to 30 feet into the air and must be a number of falling mot@@ ions ( turning , har@@ ness and salad ) before being landing at the feet .
according to the official Olympi@@ ap@@ ro@@ graph , you will be evaluated according to execution , difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot;
two @-@ und@@ eter@@ olog@@ ous athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio .
the common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts must continue in their stre@@ aks to gold , faster , after top and dr@@ au@@ ght , sometimes up to the target , sometimes , and back , down and down on the playground .
they do not ch@@ ase the finish line or the pre@@ text , but in the television transmission as well as the TV broadcast : the world or the Olympics .
the targeted goal is Nobel , ad@@ mir@@ able , even fan@@ atically - and it is enough to stir even a audience on tears .
but it is also that , what I even have to look at this games as a bit tired .
this trampoline offers a re@@ pri@@ eve .
the v@@ ector of the tramp@@ ol@@ ines is above .
a down@@ ward movement is not the goal .
he or she cri@@ es off , seem@@ ingly heavy he@@ avi@@ os like an ast@@ ron@@ aut , goes down , then down@@ wards , then effortlessly back up .
also there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during practice there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ aming , elegant cancelled of time and heavy force .
it is so Zen as the competition can only be in the Olympic Games .
the qualification and final round of women will take place on Friday afternoon in the streaming of 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men &apos;s men on Saturday also around 13.00 .
N@@ BC will exu@@ de the final round as part of an afternoon block on two days from 14.00 .
in the middle of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ie , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one who will probably survive the general tum@@ ult .
when the consciousness could only be reached by the Ang@@ li@@ en and the obj@@ ections of male athletes , according to the The Wall Street Journal , Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey anticip@@ ates his new fan base in accordance with The Wall Street Journal .
&quot; there is a generation of protests in Ethiopia , Long ( USA )
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators who demand political changes in Ethiopia , beat on violent resistance of the government .
witnesses say that three protest@@ ers were killed during cl@@ ashes with the police at Sch@@ wal@@ let .
is Ethiopia just trying to break together ?
in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries of Africa , a solid composite of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in the last months , protests against the government became the country and far more areas .
last week , thousands of people stor@@ med their streets and the fundamental political changes .
the government &apos;s response was un@@ mer@@ ciful to human rights organisations .
witnesses said that polic@@ emen were demonstr@@ ating and killing polic@@ emen .
in turn , videos are on the protests , probably from the last or beginning of this year , show how safety professionals hit young people , while these were forced to make a hand@@ held against a wall .
the chief of the UN High Authority for Human Rights now demands an investigation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was always difficult to summar@@ ize this country and will even become even more difficult , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia is the most populated country of Africa according to Nigeria and its stability is estimated from the West .
American military and intelligence services closely collabor@@ ate with the Ethiop@@ ians to combat terror attacks on the region , especially in Somalia . only few countries in Africa , when at all , so much Western help .
Ethiopia economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dra@@ stically improved - there is a new lease date in the capital of Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
the streets are generally quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia was all other than an example for democracy - human rights organisations have led down the repression of the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , where dis@@ sidents were effective for silence .
many were sent into exile or prison , killing or put into the wilderness of the desert .
but this could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you submit to people and these no other options except , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sey@@ ou@@ m Tes@@ home said a teacher into the Ethiop@@ ian Ethiop@@ ian &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire youth is protest@@ ing .
a generation is protest@@ ing .
there are numerous complaints , which cover everything from the floor to the saus@@ age handle in relation to power of the reg@@ ained coalition .
after a wide @-@ wide selection of the last year , the reg@@ ained party and its allies have reached the last seat of the opposition , and now control 100 percent of the parliament .
at the same time , the ten@@ sions rise along the border to Erit@@ rea ; a battle for this z@@ ag , controversi@@ al line required in June hundreds of lives .
analy@@ st fear the separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front , which have been en@@ forced more or less , the tur@@ mo@@ il of tur@@ bul@@ ence and could meet again .
several factors explain why feelings of failure after years of wor@@ sen@@ ing under the surface now explo@@ de .
the first seems harm@@ less : smartphones .
only in the last few years , many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate with the social media , as cheap smart phones were increasingly more common and improved the Internet services .
even if the government lock the access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do in regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate about Internet pro@@ x@@ ies , hide themselves , where they stop themselves .
several young Ethiop@@ ians showed that they were gathered to protests .
the second factor is that there are more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ nic@@ ity in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are no natural enemies .
since it prosp@@ ered , the Am@@ har@@ as , which come from e@@ th@@ op@@ ia predominantly of Christian rising countries , in politics and economy , while the Oro@@ mos explo@@ it , many of which are Muslims and live in flat areas .
but this also changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are going to coordin@@ ate under one screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of Oro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the largest protests were held in the areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and dominant in the military , in the secret services , and politics .
the third reason for the rest is death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was until his death in a non @-@ public disease in 2012 for 17 years of Ethiopia prime minister .
he was regarded as a tac@@ tical gen@@ ius , a man who could think about corners .
anal@@ ysts predi@@ ct that it was particularly conf@@ used to perceive early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and special officers to make opponents and make them un@@ dam@@ aging .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the present regime is missing at this basic skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ ush &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen from relatively un@@ clear reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
other than Mr Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray Region , came to Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am from the south .
analy@@ tics say that he enjoys the trust of the controlled security services of the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood shed .
the last time that Ethiopia had witnessed such an u@@ pro@@ ar in 2005 , after thousands of elections were protest@@ ant against elections , who were forced dis@@ rup@@ ted by the government and then stolen .
during the following Raz@@ my@@ ths , many protest@@ ers were killed , even when it were less than in the last months , and that time of distur@@ ban@@ ces went relatively quickly .
in Development , C@@ row@@ ning C@@ ents for their visionary infrastructure planning , as the new P@@ end@@ ler@@ pull , as well as for their meas@@ ur@@ able progress during poverty @-@ control .
but obviously , it has not prevented the intensi@@ fication of the internal failure of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and she occupies a dangerous eth@@ n@@ ical shape .
the last month , protests in gon@@ dar , a am@@ har@@ sh city , of Tig@@ ray managed shops and hat@@ red against the tig@@ ray is always pract@@ ised in the social media .
analy@@ tics say that the protests should bring the United States and other Western allies into an independent position .
the American government of Ethiopia used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ i on the neighboring Somalia , even though they recently ha@@ sted that they closed this basis .
while the West w@@ anting to support democracy , he will not want to cause his bund@@ le in a vol@@ at@@ ile area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin free hike . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explained his asser@@ tion Obama called IS@@ IS &quot; Sar@@ kas@@ m . &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to scatter the last contro@@ vers@@ y on Friday , referring to his campaign by provo@@ king President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; fo@@ unders &quot; of the terror@@ ists of Islamic State , not serious .
this clari@@ fication threw new questions on the communication skills of the presidential candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans if it is capable of communic@@ ating and under@@ stand@@ able with the American public .
it also takes its mit@@ ig@@ ators who ende@@ av@@ oured him to take him during an event@@ ful phase in protection , to explain the pec@@ uli@@ ar position to declare that he could not have meant .
after winning the signing in a campaign event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump was made in terms of the asser@@ tion on Thursday and consisted in interviews on Thursday that he really did not int@@ end to interpre@@ t the President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early mor@@ dial Mr. Tr@@ ump , he was simply s@@ sar@@ ist .
the twe@@ eter was contrary to the previous day , in which Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he meant being completely serious .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hug@@ h He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump help him weak@@ nesses the statement by telling him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can candidate candidate knew nothing of it .
the last storm of criticism were down to Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he tries to re@@ direct the focus on the economic situation due to his campaign .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton held spe@@ ech@@ es for the economic situation in Michigan in this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried again to return on this topic .
on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton would result in higher taxes and found that he found their talk about bor@@ ing .
Mr. Tr@@ ump did not present sar@@ cas@@ m for his defense .
at the end of July he moved to criticism when he thought the Russians should be Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails . but he later declared &quot; Of course &quot; of course I said the sar@@ ist . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the lingu@@ istic borders in the politics and then return to ru@@ ders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is one of his methods to test such messages from his fans as they arrive , and then , if necessary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the how the reaction falls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication teacher who received the language of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I think , however , he is clever enough to keep v@@ age enough for his statements , so that they can be interpreted in various ways .
instead of the sound for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump did not even assume that , since its change@@ ability has dropped further .
a new pol@@ l of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was released on Friday , showed a lead with a large advantage over the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado , and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally attempted to exc@@ use his pro@@ vocation , he accused his critic@@ isms frequently to understand his testimonies or to understand his hum@@ our .
but while he strengthened in the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s Pur@@ ze have brought his loy@@ al Mit@@ ig@@ ers into the un@@ comfortable situation , regardless of what prov@@ ok@@ ant might like his statements .
Rud@@ olph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps prominent advoc@@ ates , gave great effort to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani , he said to the correc@@ t@@ ness of Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps statements , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had established the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in that sense that Obama was an almost unknown , small organization , he named am@@ ni@@ sts , entirely wrong , and therefore it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq .
most mainst@@ re@@ am rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to ar@@ gue that the government served under Obama in which Mrs. Clinton had allowed IS@@ IS to spread out the situation in the Middle East under control .
in front of the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued to pursue its attacks on the media , and threw them before , on any of his words , and to be pre@@ occupied against him .
he infl@@ ated the &quot; poor , tw@@ il@@ ight &quot; TV experts who try to understand and said , &quot; You cannot tell it ! &quot;
some of the Democrats Group mo@@ cked at Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps , merely a further evidence that he is not suitable for the presidential election .
the café in Green@@ point is once again displac@@ ed to the award from the market
ver@@ b Cafe was a shame café in William@@ sburg , where you could pay only cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years she had good coffee .
of course , the prices from its Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ front has been displac@@ ed .
the shop So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , which took place in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of Cup@@ cakes .
native to the last loss in a rural town .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ o wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea hotel and Ver@@ b is now a soap shop . &quot;
but if New York Change is , it is also new finding .
a lively Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than one mile north of its original location .
the new Ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same employees and a similar atmosphere .
coffee is still good .
the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long@@ time staff of the old caf@@ és , the owner and managing director of the new caf@@ és .
he began working in 2001 at Ver@@ b and stayed there until the end .
when a client offered to provide money for a new exterior , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ guez , 36 , kept a lot .
ver@@ b the same distributor for the excav@@ ator bought the same es@@ pres@@ so machinery model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old Ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ guez said that he also wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu , sand@@ wi@@ ches are lined with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ ages such as cap@@ ers and s@@ auti@@ ous onions .
there are nature rec@@ tan@@ gles .
the café offers no beer more , but there are fresh ju@@ ices .
after nine months , Rodri@@ guez said that he had noticed a st@@ ained power to the previous generations .
&quot; many old customers have also been displac@@ ed by prizes from William@@ sburg , &quot; he said .
recently , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in William@@ sburg and visited the Ver@@ b regularly .
even after being moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way up .
after the ver@@ b had closed , she gave a while the coffee t@@ ines , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was clear that it was in the coffee and at the culture that was right in me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now they drink coffee , even if they are at that day instead of their usual ver@@ ced coffee , the bl@@ ended C@@ hai Tea ordered that another new addition is .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a further long@@ time and loy@@ al customer since the beginning of the year 2003 .
he went there before the work , and he ordered always the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came after seven , every day like a s@@ wis@@ s pocket watch and prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ guez , he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients in the menu .
nowadays Ros@@ enthal gets still his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ guez said that he is no h@@ let over them that the soap business has taken the old business area .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie to make a special soap for po@@ b with the ch@@ ill bre@@ w@@ ed coffee of the coffee .
&quot; I think we will still go on their offer , &quot; said Rodri@@ guez .
and the traditional , Polish residents Green@@ points also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu into Polish , and Rodri@@ guez said that he would soon express them soon , making his new neigh@@ bors welcome .
the location also has further advantages .
a local saf@@ t@@ ful saffron would like to fill the refriger@@ ate coffee into bottles and sell .
there is a chance that the café is expanding into an adjacent building .
for many customers , a new Ver@@ b is enough to get their old favorites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a professor , and said that he was destroyed on the ground , when the café ended .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that the operator &apos;s office and the best a new coffee was felt like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell the smell , &quot; he said .
the de@@ pri@@ ming food of the economic crisis in &quot; a abundant meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his asc@@ ension into the president , Franklin Del@@ ano Roosevelt decided to have lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a g@@ our@@ mets , President Roosevelt is a F@@ ai@@ ble for refined Del@@ ic@@ at@@ essen of Fifth Avenue , such as P@@ â@@ te de Fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water tur@@ tle soup .
his menu on this day was a little modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , potato pur@@ ée and as a dessert p@@ ud@@ ding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans that they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both grocery stores .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CH@@ OP Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was the Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Zi@@ egel@@ man tells about life in a residential house at the Lower East Side of the food perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their newest collaboration , &quot; A @-@ permanent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday in Har@@ per Verlag , illustrated history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity , when they meet with a re@@ porter in the ice sk@@ el@@ enberg &apos;s sandwich shop for dinner , a small , schn@@ ig@@ ik@@ os@@ em I@@ mb@@ ach in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 .
Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sauce with olive dishes , while co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with potato pur@@ ée and vegetables .
in the re@@ porter &apos;s re@@ porter , this was suitable for a discussion on the food in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man .
there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from a ingredient and a bit cheaper that stretched the access .

CO@@ E grin@@ ders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must have put in the stomach as lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years ahead of the Great Depression , the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women bo@@ iled for male field workers and it has been served fresh past@@ ed past@@ ed to breakfast , lunch and dinner .
it was the Americans who sent food to hunger in the world during the First World War . &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; shows the ways of which the country went to be no longer to be the battles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time , in the food for the Americans , a central , donated Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;

fresh fruit was replaced by inexpensive dry weight .
meat , which was the focal point of the American kitchen , became a rare luxury .

during their research for the book which also comprises recipes , Zi@@ egel@@ man prepared a dish from this ep@@ och , b@@ aked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; there was no more popular additive on lunch , &quot; says co@@ e .
Zi@@ egel@@ mann moves further : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and b@@ aked onions do not match one another .
it was typical for many of the house@@ keeping recipes .

he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed Omar dedicated his life to people in Syria .
he ris@@ ky all to save the lives of life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old died in an early @-@ breaking attack on the Assad regime .
Omar was a member of the &quot; White Hel@@ mets , &quot; a civil war group that saved almost 60,000 people according to picture @-@ Zeitung .
29@@ 00 Vol@@ unte@@ ers put their own life on the game to draw people from dist@@ ressed houses and to aff@@ ord people &apos;s first aid .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
Omar was the vision of the group : a video of civilian protection , that shows him with a 11 @-@ hour rescue of a babies from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Sy@@ rer to the bright symbolic figure in the grave of the war .
but as heroes , he has never seen himself , said to the image : &quot; for me this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I die , save life , I think that God sees a mart@@ yr for me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before Omar himself fell victim to a victim , he had spoken in a video about the last bomb attacks in Syria .
the helicopter have cast four fac@@ ades over the Alz@@ adia district , a covered with chlorine gas .
one woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breathing .
&quot; we now remove the po@@ ison@@ ous remains of the bomb , so they don &apos;t have children to play , &quot; the picture quoted his last words before he died .

Greenland : the oldest verteb@@ rates is nearly 400 years old
more rare sight .
Grön@@ ag@@ ha@@ ia usually come to the surface in the winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to go back on board by S@@ anna into the sea after an investigation .
it was born in 16@@ 24 and s@@ wimm@@ ers with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland failed only 150 years of offspring .
on the ground of the North Atlantic ocean floating on the ground of the North Atlantic , it is an average of 1,@@ 220 meters in an average .
only when it comes down , the five @-@ metre @-@ long animal accelerates to sat@@ te 2.6 km / h - and with this top speed it is half as fast as a seal .
this way of lon@@ el@@ iness lifestyle seems to be a sponsor@@ ing concept for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reports in the professional journal &quot; Science &quot; at any time by a Greenland , the 392 years old .
&quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ eu@@ er@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for demo@@ graphic Research in Rostock this life span which means for verteb@@ rates a world record .
the evolution of the ev@@ olu@@ tionary astronom@@ er already suspected that Greenland .
only lack the evidence .
Greenland &apos;s Greenland are difficult to observe , eventually they live primarily in the ice @-@ sea before the in@@ fer@@ rous coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ b@@ ard .
because it is water @-@ temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they dive in the surface usually only in winter .
researchers do not know about the lifestyle of Greenland &apos;s lifestyle .
her tim@@ esc@@ ort li@@ mb@@ s li@@ mb@@ s it , when they took six animals with one transmitter in front of S@@ val@@ b@@ ard .
however , these shar@@ ks still do : in the stomach of a beast , researchers found the remains of a Rob@@ be , another one had swal@@ lowed the p@@ ans of a young cone .
possibly , they hunt the sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice @-@ sea and seek car@@ c@@ ass , which are from higher water shi@@ fts to the bottom .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues investigated 28 Grön@@ ag@@ ha@@ ia , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or S@@ val@@ b@@ ard as a st@@ ub out of the depths of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long , while the largest 502 centi@@ metre found .
to determine the age of animals , they analyzed the lens of shar@@ ks with the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of ey@@ eb@@ lens exists before the birth of Ha@@ ie , which contained therein are not renewed later .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had a lot of carbon @-@ 14 in the lens core .
therefore , after the early 1960s , their birth should lie down as nuclear weapons tests of large quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
in the length of 220 cm of the third smallest animal , the lens @-@ core contained a low surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from nuclear weapons , it is likely to celebrate its 50th birthday in its investigation in 2012 .
all the larger ones of Greenland had normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities , which is produced by cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock was seen for a 4@@ 93 centi@@ meter @-@ long Greenland , which should even be 392 years old while the record @-@ shar@@ k with 502 centimeters is likely to be 392 years old .
that Greenland @-@ female becomes flat @-@ growing only when they are longer than four metres , it was well known .
now the researchers were assigned to the length .
since one of the animals with 392 centimeters is probably at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age at 156 years was determined , Grön@@ ag@@ ha@@ ia is apparent at least one and a half centuries of time .
that is likely to be world record for verteb@@ rates currently .
that such meth@@ us@@ al is mainly living in ice waters , is no co@@ incidence .
the previous record holder , an 211 @-@ year @-@ old Greenland , whose bac@@ on , on the neck , was caught on a 120 year old har@@ po@@ on head , was caught on Alaska .
at low temperatures , the organ@@ ism also runs on as@@ par@@ agus .
they &apos;re waiting later - and al@@ tern slow down .
in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals often become particularly large .
because the volume is growing faster than its surface due to the animal heat .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram of eleph@@ ant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal lives so more dangerous and should focus on what as soon as possible , as soon as possible , as soon as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the evolution of evolution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the evolution of evolution &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , a very large animal should be investing more in a long life .
construction floor in double pack
with topics of this building , the Municipal Council in the most recent meeting has been discussed .
with relief , the Committee adopted by Mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; finally the marketing of the recently approved residential areas may commence . &quot;
after the bound@@ ary , par@@ cel@@ eration and closing surveys have been resolved , the sale of plots in the residential areas &quot; street &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( area of Bin@@ der@@ straße - Sub@@ project section 1 ) has nothing to interested in interested parties .
the Municipal Coun@@ sel is convinced that the weak@@ nesses in the rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au young families and senior citizens alike speak alike .
as it was said , we can report itself in the City Hall , on the awarding of the plots , the community is expected to be presented in his September session .
in order to res@@ ett@@ les the res@@ ett@@ les of further commercial firms , connected to the creation of jobs , the Municipal Council decided to change its newly created land plan in the spring of this year .
as a result , there will be two par@@ c@@ els in the area with two plots in the direction of state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
the city on the Main has therefore in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg the best chances to put out London lost jobs and firms .
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt benef@@ ited from the most of Bre@@ x@@ it vote , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of the Compet@@ ence Markets and Real Estate markets of the I@@ W .
according to the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is un@@ certain whether fin@@ homes can continue to operate from financial transactions within the entire EU .
for the so @-@ called EU @-@ Pass it is enough to offer approval in the UK .
that &apos;s just great US banks .
several banks have already announced to negoti@@ ate jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt am Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens up with 10000 new jobs on the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , so the I@@ W , the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the Eurozone , and further important authorities as the European insurance view E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk provisions ES@@ R@@ B .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) established its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the banknote is important to banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luxembourg , a large fund sector , tail@@ ored as in Dublin for the infrastructure as well as in the infrastructure .
Frankfurt am clearly easier to reach the big airport .
further points the city is available with easily available commercial real estate .
&quot; in Paris , it is not so easy to find free @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ ean .
in addition , the rent for first @-@ class commercial real estate investment is 50 percent higher than on the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt also offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crimin@@ ality .
in a ranking of corporate consultancy Mer@@ cer the city on place seven , Luxembourg on No.@@ 19 and Dublin on No.@@ 33 and Paris on 3@@ 7th place .
even if life quality is a question of pre@@ ferences : &quot; with his already strong position as a financial centre for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors . &quot;
but in spite of Bre@@ x@@ it vote , London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe , my economic research .
thus the forces of forces said : in London , according to the figures of Landesbank Hel@@ aba , the end of 2015 around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking sector , in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2500 .

Mer@@ ck tries to draw up the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case goes back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck participated in each other , and took possession of laboratory work , including Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vi@@ r . , the active ingredient in the medic@@ ations of Gilead .

Clin@@ ton earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal tax
on Friday , Hill@@ ary Clinton released their tax return for 2015 , a revenues of USD 10,@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 Clinton donated USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes mainly to Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton delivered almost USD 5.3 million in spe@@ ech@@ es ; the former Foreign Minister issued an income of USD 3 million by Simon &amp; Sch@@ uster for her book in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clin@@ ton candidate for Vice President Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton , his tax returns the last ten years .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to continue standards in terms of financial transparency , while Clin@@ ton Kamp@@ ag@@ nen@@ hel@@ per Jenni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i was announced in an opinion .
in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump hidden behind false expres@@ sions and re@@ trac@@ ing in terms of previous promises to publish his tax return .
it is common for the US presidential candidate , to publish their tax returns , although they are not obliged by law .
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have given as reason for its ref@@ us@@ al to control the tax authorities .
&quot; they are at Zug , &quot; wrote Clin@@ ker &apos;s campaign workers &quot; Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , with regard to the publication of the presidential candidate in the Democrats .
on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ um@@ ps Special advis@@ ers to CN@@ N that he would not allow tr@@ ump to release something before the controls are not completed .
Tr@@ um@@ ps critics , among others also the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already deser@@ ted that his ref@@ us@@ al questions regarding assets , his contributions for char@@ itable organisations , his business and various other connections , especially with Russia .
Clinton had already been over@@ thrown on the subject and released a video on the internet in which high ranking Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump pursu@@ es its tax return .
on Thursday , she spoke about the subject of a speech to the economy in Michigan .
&quot; he ref@@ uses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax return . &quot; she said to the crowd .
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO has reported that Tr@@ ump did not pay or just a very little taxes during the 1990s , and an economic journalist in the New York Times quoted a number of tax@@ pay@@ roll and tax advis@@ ers , the information that this could be the case .
state taxes have become a theme in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation that is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett that would make sure that people pay more than USD 1 million a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during a campaign event for Hill@@ ary Clinton in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called the buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away Industri@@ gl@@ omer@@ ate here has his seat , Tr@@ ump to exchange their tax return .
&quot; &quot; &quot; buffet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said he was subjected to a tax inspection of the IRS and Tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear of the voters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the elec@@ tors and not before tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ cke campaign has published tax return back to 2007 .
the Clin@@ ton , which now lives in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an average effective federal tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective control rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % .
the tax returns in 2015 showed that this only USD 100 income became involved in wages , unlike the most of all Americans .

Jewish director dist@@ resses Berlin hotel because Israeli pres@@ election after &quot; arab@@ ic &quot; was removed - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ ted a media up@@ set after he had betrayed that the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Bristol Hotel in Berlin has no Israeli pres@@ election , since there would be Arab guests according to a staff . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Hol@@ oc@@ ent@@ documentary film &quot; Shoah &quot; made his anger at the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by winning an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the country &apos;s selection list .
however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be accessed directly from the hotel rooms .
what is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of Germany &apos;s capital , possible that Israel elim@@ in@@ ates and deleted Israel ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers a possibility to choose Israel over an own call center .
after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel lobby .
the answer , which he received there , &quot; sho@@ cked him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote .
the hotel stated that the measure has a &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the management of Kemp@@ in@@ ski hotels . &quot;
the reason that behind it was dissolved in the director even more rage .
&quot; most of our guests are Arab@@ s and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election will be deleted , &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann was cited .
the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ an @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great dis@@ grace , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were horri@@ fied by this event .
that is really very angry .
the fact that in Germany this hotel chain has happened in Germany , even greater dis@@ grace is even better .
this requires no explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ministers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a rather big reson@@ ance on the internet , where people called the whole sc@@ and@@ al .
some people submitted to the Kemp@@ in@@ ski hotel , that it would have been given to the alleged responsibility of Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; ashamed of you , &quot; she named it in another article that is noted that the hotel is located on the no@@ blem@@ an Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a synagogue .
the hotel quickly denied all the alleg@@ ations of himself and called the incident &quot; suspic@@ ious &quot; in Lanz@@ mann , reported Der Spiegel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct order , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Israel did not record into the fast list list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted at the South German newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kemp@@ in@@ ski Hotels &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the country code is added now .

students gathered together on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo with the police , when they gathered themselves together to demonstrate against the re@@ forms of government for public education system .
the police set the lac@@ ri@@ eng@@ as and rubber handles against demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began when police officers tried to cast off the students , which led to the police rubber handles and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as police .

trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT business
according to Russian Ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ in D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan grew by 7@@ 0.9 percent , according to Russian Ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , the interest in Russian companies grew strongly in the country , divided the ambassador .
Russian companies take existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to make access to the market .
of course , the further trade fair is one of the largest priorities of the bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan .
he noted that the trade rate between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 increased by 7@@ 0.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , the Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent to Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
the business up@@ swing was reached by deliveries of machines , land vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambassador .
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes back to Russia for this year from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year , the Russian foreign agency invested around 35,000 Vis@@ as , primarily associated with Reis@@ ev@@ is@@ as , on Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries , the number of tourists in Russia .
we could say that the record number of Iranian tourists in Russia will be broken off , &quot; he said .
at the same time , just a few Russians visit Iran , something that hopes the Ambassador that it will change .
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d to have received the monuments of the ancient Persian civ@@ ilization in a good condition , &quot; he said .

Scot@@ ch Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ ms home , as Br@@ ite Gold for Rad@@ sport
&quot; &quot; &quot; Scottish Call@@ um Sk@@ inner &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last night in a male team @-@ spr@@ int in Rio for fame , when the British team defended the title of London 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor roller , which had made his coun@@ try@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y . the meeting and made the legend proud to come home a victory from the favour@@ ites of New Zealand .
four years ago , England claimed a sho@@ cking victory , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympi@@ ad medals .
they repeated the trick , after they took place in March at the railway World Championships in London despite the withdrawal of Ho@@ ys only a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as exec@@ uting .
Ho@@ ys retirement produced a gap that tried K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ ampton .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw the potential in the sh@@ all@@ ots , which now un@@ fold .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - who sat four years ago with Ho@@ y won - and Sk@@ inner sat in the qualification round a Olympic champion , but in the stand@@ alone rounds the New Zealand won the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
after his turn , there was short , but Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and Sk@@ inner .
a strategy change made a large part of transformation from where in a higher gear to slow it down and it &apos;s Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y looked up from his position as a BBC expert and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des , when these rose to the podium .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a radi@@ ant comparison . &quot;
I am only here to do my best and to make me a name .
we set up an Olympic champion in the end round and defeated the World Champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph in 2012 at the page Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys in addition , there was a clear start to the railroad after a weak start .
he withdrew this statement later , and there was no appeal of England rival .
this time , in such a superior victory there was no such problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It feels like the whole GB flags at the grand@@ stand as London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
we came with so many world tit@@ les so bad that it was incredible again at the Olympi@@ ad .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , who won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months , we are expecting successful five days in Vel@@ od@@ rom .
with the shape of Kenn@@ y it is possible in the realm of Pos@@ sible that he repeated the victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition .
that would be for Kenn@@ y - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who also was born on March 23 ( a apparently holy date for British sports ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal .
the cheese is equal to Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the spr@@ int , which begins today and will go over three days .
the 28 year old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot;
the Team event always is best .
it can win it with his colleagues .
it feels something lon@@ ely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two other gold medals , he should be defeated at the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only med@@ alli@@ on competition of the day , but there were other news for England .
Sir Bra@@ ve W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four @-@ kilometre race .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 942 .
the world record , which won gold in 2012 at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held today on the second day of the contest , while the W@@ ig@@ gins will be focus on safety .
he had fought yesterday with evidence before the qualification , when the func@@ tion@@ aries had called him to measure his height .
in the appropriate Women &apos;s Competition , which continued tomorrow , and finished , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ ie in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB team is leaving his strong railway team to domin@@ ate the medium @-@ time period of the Olympic Games and to get a s@@ ar to medals .
after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute Domin@@ ance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio was shut down .
it plays Dr@@ amas in the background , leaving the re@@ sign@@ ation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April amongst sex and mo@@ b@@ b@@ ing@@ es and retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ leton .
however , if one sees itself the first evening of the competition at the bicycle rom , it looks quite afterwards , the legendary reputation GB@@ S , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment .
future of the melting of Portland , due to the end of the energy consumption
the future of aluminum mel@@ ts from Portland , Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - are standing at the game since the plant operator will cancel the energy supply contract , making all delivery contracts , like the supplier of energy companies .
this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria in the beginning of this year , no other subsi@@ dies to operate the plant .
a maximinum payout of 20 years has been set out in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the complex of Al@@ coa in Portland are standing on the game .
no fewer than 2000 work@@ stations -@@ direct as well as indirect - could be end@@ anger@@ ed at a closing time .
in addition , it could come to Domin@@ o@@ effects , as the melting plant uses around 10 per cent of the total electricity generation of Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as .
in 2014 , Al@@ coa completed the Point Henry melt , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year .
the melt of Al@@ coa in Portland loses money and ris@@ ky a closure .
this stage follows the years of spec@@ ulations regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last , due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , who supplies the large aluminium shafts with its Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , divided it out that three further owners will be announced their contracts .
the facility is in the majority of a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ en@@ i Cor@@ p will keep smaller shares .
&quot; AG@@ L goes out that the plant in Portland continues to operate , which means a further physical demand for electricity through the melting , &quot; divided the company .
AG@@ L also said that the contracts called &quot; securing transactions &quot; should be in force starting in November 2016 .
contracts have a 12 @-@ month period of notice that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to the revenues &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the supply of electricity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impact on income on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong termin@@ ology for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L evaluated the value of the contracts already in its annual financial statements in the amount of $ 187 million in &quot; expect@@ ation of a cancellation . &quot;
Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; ability of Al@@ co@@ as ... the melt of the melting or the power supply to ensure the melting of the melting . &quot;
the US company said that it has concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who should have risen in effect from November this year , even if there is still a declaration , why it came from the contract .
in front of the bad economic conditions of the sector in front of the possible closure of the Portland melting in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near Newcastle .
in reference to the statements of the Analy@@ ti@@ cian at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that there will consume about 900 megawatts and Tom@@ ago about 900 megawatts .
if both plants are dis@@ appearing from the market , there would be a considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; current market &#93; .
and for us as generating sets , this would not be good , &quot; he said .
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an reality TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of September edition of the V@@ ogue
K@@ end@@ all J@@ en@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an J@@ en@@ ner C@@ lan@@ s Kr@@ is is on the cover of the cov@@ eted Sept@@ ember@@ issue of the US V@@ ogue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der is and at Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced the news on her Inst@@ ag@@ ram account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a space full of people I love , brought me the sight of this Co@@ vers for weeping , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the unveil@@ ing of the Co@@ vers followed a bizar@@ re ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an family ) , which shows the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an J@@ en@@ ner family as well as in the presence of the most popular show bi@@ z @-@ on @-@ angle and producers of Ke@@ eping Up R@@ yan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , just like she finished the cover of her sister , and ends with a classical completion : they all have a surprises planning .
this represents the cl@@ erg@@ ee@@ zed action for almost every birthday . Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You thought that we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon animation on a Sen@@ de@@ platz at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning , but Kr@@ is had to participate in this Public@@ ity .
with regard to the September issue of V@@ ogue , the V@@ ogue started a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans .
K@@ end@@ all is big sister Kim like she ( she and her husband Kan@@ ye West were on it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of September issue of the magazine is a league for themselves .
the September issue is for V@@ ogue , most of the most expensive edition of the year .
with a circumference , rather resem@@ bles a fashion magazine resem@@ bles a fashion magazine , the issue offers a large number of advertis@@ ements ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were from the 8@@ 32 pages of the roller 615 pages advertisement ) .
the unveil@@ ing of his Co@@ ver@@ stars is expected to be ad@@ dic@@ tive that over the last two years the journal are still le@@ ak@@ ened before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Moss .
in recent years , more &quot; celebr@@ ities , the Mod@@ ules &quot; as &quot; Models , the celebr@@ ities are &quot; on the cover .
in 2013 Oscar @-@ Pre@@ ist@@ band and Di@@ or @-@ brand ambassador Jenni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
but even at the low probability that Mr@@ s J@@ en@@ ner - which is described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; break model &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their generation - under the former category , it is in good company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this celebr@@ ities are not related with famous people , or reality stars or young people from today that know how to hit a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if everything goes on J@@ en@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who stand in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , which appeared on the last cover , had the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of her career .
of course J@@ enn@@ ers don &apos;t like success .
with its reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ er &apos;s position was still very anxi@@ ous in the fashion world .
in June the lon@@ ging Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Steph@@ anie Sey@@ m@@ our J@@ en@@ ner and her colleagues in Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d and named them &quot; The Mist@@ er of the Eye &quot; .
this feelings bo@@ iled up again when the message comes with the publication J@@ enn@@ ers on the V@@ ogue Cover .
but on the mist@@ y sh@@ ove it seems to be at the point .
K@@ end@@ all J@@ en@@ ner is on the cover of the sept@@ um edition of V@@ ogue .
it is in the true sense of the word a super model .
she runs for Marc Jacobs .
it creates advertising for your floor plan of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
and all of her sisters will sell you images of their respective Pay@@ able apps .
she sells pictures from Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the magazine LO@@ VE .
and in their free time it is visible in reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
municipal centres show 16@@ 0,000 people each year
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s help fig@@ s have been accounted for every year by the Municipal Cent@@ res Cent@@ res , while the industry accounts for the impact of further medium @-@ cut transactions .
in Queens@@ land , three of five people - mostly elderly people , immig@@ rants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means of un@@ just del@@ og@@ ations and similar products - when searching for free legal services and legal assistance .
legal services provided by the church , which are already over@@ crow@@ ded , are ready for further cuts .
as of June next year , this legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal states .
the Director of the Municipal Cent@@ res of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rel@@ l said that the last survey of the National Association of Municipal Cent@@ res revealed that thousands of people were rejected every year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation without repe@@ ating the decision of the Federal Government shall only be worse .
&quot; Queens@@ land community centres are chron@@ ically @-@ funded , which means thousands of people from important services that you need to be rejected , &quot; he said .
people who leave violent relationships , people with un@@ mist@@ ak@@ able and poll@@ uted debts , families who have been dismissed by separ@@ ations , workers , in@@ consist@@ encies , and this survey shows that they cannot receive the help that they need .
the Federal Government will cut its funds by 30 percent from June 2017 , meaning that thousands of aid people from Queens@@ land will be forced to just@@ ify their legal problems without any help .
we call for the Federal Prosecutor and the Federal Government of the Federal Government and the Sen@@ ators of Queens@@ land George Bran@@ dis , to raise these middle short@@ cuts , so that people may need to receive legal problems with legal problems .
last year , the state government filled their promise to lift the funds for sp@@ ouses on the national average .
it is now at the time to view the needs of the community centres and their customer communities , and that the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k is investing in such an important work .

this showed representative surveys of Outlook IN@@ SA for the &quot; Image &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black government coalition could fall short on the north , this is not possible after the change values in Berlin .

Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
E @-@ mail and Internet in Time : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator came onto the market .
the successor today domin@@ ate the world - his producer experienced a disaster .
the device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was th@@ icker and larger , it was therefore not good in hand .
on the contrary , it was pretty kno@@ cked .
the built @-@ in memory was at the beginning of eight meg@@ abytes , which would be enough for about two stran@@ ds with high resolution .
an iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 gig@@ abytes .
the &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; came exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , to the stores - and it was the first smartphone .
for a few euros , lovers can still be purchased on the Internet , but they come somehow from the Stone Age of the Internet .
20 years ago , the Communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone maker had announced the product a few months earlier at C@@ eb@@ it &apos;s Computer Games in Hanover , Germany . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received a lot : SMS and emails could be sent and received , also by fax , the Communic@@ ator was able to reach .
even access to websites was possible via HTML browsers , although it &apos;s slowly too slow .
a calcul@@ ator was available , an digital address book and a electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be opened similar to a laptop .
then a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen took place .
the price was quite proud : 2700 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 Euro .
the average price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 million in 2015 .
no one could take place in August 1996 that the Communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
the smart phones are a success story , if not for Nokia .
the financial cell map of the Finn@@ s had an unprecedented disin@@ teg@@ rate , was finally sold to Microsoft .
today , the market be@@ holds today that came all much later than Nokia .
always and everywhere , this is today for very many people everyday life .
in 2015 there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide .
about 1.4 billion devices have been sold , on Samsung and Apple accounts for only 555 million pieces .
global sales with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
this is the well @-@ ongoing business of the countless app providers and the telecommunic@@ ations concert .
around the Smartphone is now an entire industry .
the decisive breakthrough to the mass market came in early 2007 , at that time , Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced on the Mac @-@ World the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an Internet communications , all with touch screen is easy to use .
Apple began the Apple &apos;s triumph@@ ant success today , the iPhone is the most important product of the Group .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market .
they disappeared finally , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the ages now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is 20 years after its invention , a self @-@ sensitivity .
on average , each Germans now looks back on its mobile phone in 88 times a day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must learn all to take the smartphone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina sphere , in the Siemens Board of staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is now a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must len@@ til the olymp@@ ic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row is not only offered in our local municipalities and throughout London , but in the whole country of renewal and prosper@@ ity .
for me , this was the largest attraction in He@@ ath@@ row , just as in 2012 in London when we run a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benef@@ ited from games .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits for Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and we will be able to get new possibilities for local and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local congregations alone , we &apos;re already able to create 10,000 new apprentices , 40,000 new jobs and youth unemployment within the airport environment .
as they were in London 2012 , there will be such that the challenge of enlargement He@@ ath@@ row is too big .
it was told me that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be scre@@ ened at the world stage .
the two fl@@ atten@@ s had wrong and they are also wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there is always obstacles to cease , but He@@ ath@@ row answered every question .
as the Olympic Games is He@@ ath@@ row for many and not for individual infrastructure project .
the expansion is an opportunity to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion at wit@@ ty growth and a legacy of skills and employment in order to leave the airport as well as in the UK .
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion in infrastructure investment programme in time and budget , from the T5 - the five years in succession to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to T2 , which was built in the middle of the two most frequ@@ ented mileage of the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third running drive , which is supported by £ 16 billion to private investment .
the London Games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the extension of He@@ ath@@ row is also one of them .
it is time that we bro@@ aden these Olympic and He@@ ath@@ row and creating our future trading and create a legacy of skills and jobs to be proud of England .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ atz and mouse game &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding display block
for companies , who earn money online money , according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to handle ad block , a &quot; k@@ atz@@ - and mouse game . &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook would block that it would be blocked on his des@@ kt@@ op@@ page , Ad@@ block Plus released a blo@@ g@@ post , in which it could update their filters in the program to block advertis@@ ements in the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook with that his des@@ kt@@ op@@ page would change the encoding regarding his advertis@@ ements , in order to identify it , which is part of the page advertising which is part of the page advertising .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to circum@@ vent the new codes .
in a blo@@ g@@ post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her @-@ struggle between the an@@ vil Open Source Community and the surro@@ unds has already been possible since the invention of ad temp@@ ting in the track , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook is coming soon with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest company has left for social media in the fight is a strong indi@@ z for the sector , as ar@@ ous@@ ed for the industry .
according to a study conducted by Pa@@ gre@@ air and Adobe around 200 million people worldwide use display and almost four times as much in 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion every day active users , access on Facebook via their mobile devices , hand @-@ advertising covers 84 percent of advertising covers fac@@ eb@@ ooks .
the company has shown it on display recor@@ ders to desktop PCs as mobile display block no effect on fac@@ eb@@ ooks mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ ag@@ ram .
advertisement on Desktop PCs makes a sufficient amount of revenues so that Facebook is worthwhile as worthwhile as worthwhile as worth it .
on Tuesday , Facebook said that it would be possible to re@@ ject his &quot; ad reference tool , &quot; to put the people more control over them .
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ block had ar@@ tic@@ ulate new filters , because they would also block content on the page that are no advertising on the page .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the users , this is no positive experience , therefore we plan to address the problem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; divided a speaker of Facebook in an e @-@ mail communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a silent , why we have concentr@@ ating on developing tools such as Ad pre@@ ferences to place more control into the hands of people .
woman being suspected of suicide on Swiss Highway
the sacrifice was in the middle of the night on the fre@@ eway .
the police call witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday during an assumed self @-@ murder of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred at the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
a woman put in Dun@@ kl@@ en , &quot; an act of desp@@ air &quot; on the road and were hit by several cars , the police stated in the Vau@@ d .
it is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49 , which was sent by several vehicles , including a load car , was wanted to kill himself .
she still died .
several drivers have already been listed , but some are not identified by the police , the police , who , as well as witnesses of the incident , said to report itself .
it was opened an investigation procedure , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter distributed to Le Tribun@@ e de Gen@@ eve .
however , it remains for waiting if one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a cl@@ ash avoid@@ able ?
this is something that the prosecutor has to decide , &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter .
two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers will not be put to responsibility .
in each of the two cases - in which one person ran in the Dun@@ kl@@ es on the motorway , it was decided that drivers must not go out of it that a pedestri@@ ans runs in the middle of the night , as it was called in the newspaper .
last year a polic@@ y@@ holder was acquitted on the cas@@ ual assault that she had a man survived and killed , who had a night at the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old had drunk , and has become un@@ conscious in the street .
the Court found that the polic@@ eman had responded to an justified manner -- on an justified type and that the presence of a man on the road had a &quot; completely extraordinary and un@@ predic@@ table situation , &quot; the judge said .
everyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday in the vicinity of Morges , should report to the police at number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 44 .
NASA climate models : Venus was once hab@@ itable
according to the proj@@ ections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was likely to be hab@@ itable .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of the Venus basis from tools and algorith@@ ms that resem@@ ble them of climate @-@ research .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could be consumed with its hot , water @-@ loose surface and CO2 dens@@ ities atmosphere could have de@@ pri@@ ved in similar conditions .
scientists have previously noted that the slow revolution of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ ful atmosphere , and slowly stopped slowly .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably proved more dry regions than Earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to store life and protected from faster evap@@ oration .
the early Venus benef@@ ited from one Sun , which was 30 percent matter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow revolution of Venus showed its day of the sun for almost two months , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this war@@ med the surface and produces rain , creates a thick layer of clouds , which works like a rain@@ bow to sh@@ iel@@ ding the surface of a large part of the sun heat .
the results are average temperatures that are a few degrees cooler than the Earth today .
the model brought out a history of the Venus that resem@@ bles the evolution that had previously suspected of planets .
although it was likely to be hab@@ itable , the Venus was exposed to much heat and ultra@@ violet light during the course of several billion years .
their oceans has evap@@ or@@ ated and its water vap@@ or was burned down from ultra@@ violet light .
when their hydro mowers accounted for only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a dead@@ ly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , which we know it today .
the researchers evaluated the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Letters .
Patrick Roy enters as a trainer of the Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy re@@ signed on Thursday as a coach and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che , which led to a minimum assignment in decision @-@ making of the team .
alternatively , President / General Manager of Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic uph@@ eld this decision and noted that the association will immediately search for a new trainer immediately after a new trainer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last three years I have performed my duties as head coach and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and destination , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy has been fulfilled in an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have thought in the course of summer long and much thought about how I could improve this team to give him more depth , this makes it necessary and bring it to a higher level .
in order to achieve this , the Vision of the trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations has to be voted for the organisation .
he must also have a right decision on decisions regarding the performance of the team .
these conditions are not fulfilled .
on 23 May 2013 , Sak@@ ic announced his contributions to the team for his contributions to the team .
&quot; Patrick has informed me this decision , &quot; said Sak@@ ic .
we appreciate all what he did for our organization and wish him for the future the best .
during his debut season with the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 , the winner of Jack Adams Awards was awarded as the best coach of the league .
he led the association to 112 points and in the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Play@@ offs of Minnesota and missed the post@@ season in each of the two last years .
the Aval@@ an@@ ches signed a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 mark in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the game for a second Wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference by five points .
the Hall of Fame Tor@@ wart has won four Stanley C@@ ups - two pieces with the Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the Aval@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ e@@ lar@@ ion join talks , continue strike
the workers were suspended regarding the re@@ mun@@ eration for Nord@@ se@@ e@@ pl@@ ings during all cont@@ actors for a new conversation round at the table , said the negoti@@ ator .
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were carried out spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea created by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wood Group as well as the un@@ ite trade unions can confirm that we have agreed on to rest@@ art the process process of the current battle &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says it in a common statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will hold some full @-@ day sessions in the coming weeks , which will start the beginning of next year to re@@ sign the problems .
the trade unions said that their last strike , who is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year , Wood Group has cut its contra@@ sts to its contra@@ sts in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s ratings follows a 10 percent reduction for on@@ shore contrac@@ tors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts to the company will have the required space to come through the market down@@ turn .
Shell has released its part of thousands of people and announced plans to aband@@ on his oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries , as it stream@@ lined its business activities as a result of its meg@@ ac@@ us flame flow with the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are based on the lower cru@@ de oil prices , an economic situation that by the decision of the British in June to leave the European Union .
the Scottish parliament of Parliament Dave Anderson met workers &quot; workers in early this week to discuss one of the greatest labour disp@@ utes which took place since a generation in the North Sea .
North Sea is important for regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need a business that works for many and not only a few works , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
2016 will be less than $ 1.4 billion in spending for new projects in the North Sea as opposed to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Kepler measures rot@@ ational rate of stars in star cluster of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Kepler Wel@@ dream teles@@ cope has helped to collect the complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the star of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades .
the new data help the astronom@@ ers understand why stars can rotate within the star cluster as well as in what respect the rot@@ ational spaces with the formation of the planet .
&quot; we hope that through the same of our results with other star clusters , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at C@@ alt@@ ech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star cluster of Pl@@ ei@@ ades is located 445 light years from the earth .
many stars in this star cluster created around 125 million years ago , reach adul@@ th@@ ood .
they now turn right now .
at peak rot@@ ational rates , these exp@@ ire stars are cast large amounts of star winds .
since this winds drive through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a s@@ lightest effect on the stars .
when a star is aged , its rot@@ ational rate begins to slow down .
Kepler also measures the rot@@ ational rate of each star when he recogni@@ zes the time between the appearing of a recogni@@ z@@ able dying - such as sun st@@ ains -- .
the latest catalog of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more massive stars brigh@@ ter than less massive stars .
Reb@@ orn compar@@ es the stars with dancers , whereby larger stars left pi@@ rou@@ bles as smaller ones .
in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades we see that bor@@ row@@ ly rot@@ ors tend to be mass@@ aging than faster rot@@ ors to be very bright stars , &quot; Reb@@ ull said .
since the star cluster of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ide@@ ological laboratory to compare pitch qualities such as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; the star cluster of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
it is still a lot of us how we would like to learn more like the How , When and why stars s@@ lows down their rot@@ ational rates and so to speak your &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and their colleagues are reported in detail on their latest analysis of the rotary rates of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades , which will be published soon in the astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversi@@ al Bas@@ eball Star enters
tears ran faster than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days of Base Base at Alex Rodri@@ guez .
after its emotional response announcement , the 41 year old professional will take place on August 12 against the t@@ amp@@ a Bay R@@ ays a last time the Tri@@ h@@ kot of his New York Y@@ ank@@ ets .
I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &apos; Good@@ b@@ ye &apos; to communicate with the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star game participants of the major league bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
three times , Rodri@@ guez became the most valuable player of the league , in 2009 , he won the World Series with the Y@@ ank@@ ets .
he has signed a tenth deal of US dollars annually since 2007 .
until the end of contrast to 31 December 2017 , it acts as a consultant and youth coach - with full content .
as a player , Rodri@@ guez paid long time with power .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he managed the Y@@ ank@@ ets a few mil@@ estones .
with the Hall of Fame Members , H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays show two other bas@@ eball players in the most important statistics similar values .
but the 41 @-@ year @-@ old is probably not included in the glory hall of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls .
because so successfully Rodri@@ guez - the nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - on the field , his appearance is outside the place .
as early as 2009 , the super@@ star presented to &quot; ES@@ PN , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 , the ster@@ oids have tried to be taken .
in August 2013 , he was closed to 211 games due to a settlement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis @-@ Sk@@ and@@ al until the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ guez is considered the main @-@ suspic@@ ious , many years over an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
after a dispute , the sperm was still reduced to 162 encoun@@ ters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the league could even have a favour for the year 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ guez said then . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his f@@ arewell days will not be silent .
while many bas@@ eball le@@ gen@@ ds in their last games are still the big stage , Rodri@@ guez had to sit on the bank .
&quot; my job does not include any f@@ arewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes the attempt to win any game , &quot; says Y@@ ank@@ ee @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ard@@ i .
after all , Rodri@@ guez , who was married with the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az , and to the act@@ ress Kate Hudson , sympath@@ y @-@ conversion of fans from Y@@ ank@@ ee @-@ Erz@@ ri@@ val@@ en Boston Red SO@@ X .
&quot; we want a @-@ Rod , &quot; sang the pend@@ ants at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ guez Team .
Olympia 2016 : Chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ in@@ ski are first d@@ op@@ ing@@ cases
wi@@ m@@ ingly : because of a positive di@@ op@@ ing@@ ing , Adrian &apos;s score may not start from Poland in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games will surprise by the first official D@@ op@@ ing@@ es .
a great athl@@ ete would have won almost a medal .
prior to the seventh race events , the first official release of the Rio de Janeiro have become known for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers Chen X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ metre steep@@ le trained in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and the Polish weigh@@ t@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ in@@ ski were positive and excluded - immediately before the beginning of the athlet@@ ic athlet@@ ics competitions this news come to the time .
for Chen was already proven the di@@ ure@@ tics of hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ de last Sunday , which is used as a m@@ asked means for d@@ op@@ ing@@ bats .
on Friday afternoon the International Sports Court of CA@@ S confirmed their exclusion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took the fourth place in the final over 100 m Butterfly , just around 0.09 seconds , she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Chen would have to participate in the pre @-@ war more than 50 m Fre@@ estyle .
Chen received the opening of the B @-@ Trial and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) at the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association take the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very seriously and demands Chen full cooperation among the investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cited X@@ in@@ hua from a Communication : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will work together with the International Sport@@ al@@ shof CA@@ S and will accept the verdict . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history not more than the IOC , but the CA@@ S is responsible for the san@@ ction of the sport@@ s@@ men with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio , the news on the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ ek@@ owa , with the 33 @-@ year @-@ old therefore went into the offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was an incredible shock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she is innocent , &quot; the only explanation could be food supplements . &quot;
according to the report , it is said to act with the prohibited substance by blood d@@ op@@ ing@@ ing EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ ova was given provisional release suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B sample is expected to have a positive effect .
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ jko Bor@@ is@@ sow wonder@@ ed immediately with criticism of the athl@@ ete &apos;s athl@@ ete .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the sport@@ s@@ men do not drag the correct battles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have been under observation , so many are already excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about all weigh@@ t@@ lif@@ ter from the chronic d@@ op@@ ing@@ ed nation may not be able to participate in Rio .
on Friday , the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ in@@ ski &quot; was also known , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested for three days earlier on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on .
both contest the intake , both may not start in class up to 94 kg .
prior to the start of the event , Dan@@ ek@@ owa is another serious blow for the reputation of the entire sport .
the world association IA@@ AF had the complete Russian crew to an exception due to systematic D@@ op@@ ings , also the L@@ äu@@ fer@@ nation Kenya produced in Rio numerous bad news .
in the swim sports there were also the previous clubs in China for fierce battles between the athletes .
so the Fr@@ ench@@ man C@@ amille Lac@@ our@@ t took the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang har@@ sh .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt purple . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium over 200 m Fre@@ estyle I will pass over , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun stood at the heart of a con@@ front@@ ation with the Australian M@@ ack H@@ orton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and not respect for D@@ oping st@@ rü@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was positive in 2014 with the Chinese nationals positive on the stim@@ ul@@ ans Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but had to sit only a three im@@ on@@ ati@@ ge sperm .
data kl@@ au : so per@@ fi@@ de presses h@@ acker her rans@@ om money
program@@ mers of generating malware are currently targeted entities in - and are successful .
according to a recent survey of the malware department specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes under 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of surveyed companies in the past twelve months were at least once , some multi @-@ offerings a attack with er@@ press@@ er software .
in Germany nearly 20 percent of companies were already a target of a R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware pur@@ ification .
40 percent of victims paid will@@ ingly offered by the perpet@@ rators required to use the challenged systems and data .
the do@@ ers speci@@ alis@@ es their er@@ aser software according to the observ@@ ations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes to Att@@ acks in corporate networks .
if they are successful there , the potential allowance is significantly higher than with private users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we currently observe a terri@@ fying fast evolution of pollut@@ ant software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; painter Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski declares in conversation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 most of the drawing programs have been designed to send advertis@@ ements .
then the perpet@@ rators re@@ discovered software for itself .
only private users were the target , but the change to company att@@ ains took place over the past months in the past few months .
R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware is working according to a simple pattern : once in the computer of a bull , you search for in@@ long changed files such as WordPress , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files and to archives of images and videos .
these files en@@ codes the R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als su@@ stain@@ ably .
the software then presents the requirements of the er@@ press@@ er .
to get the final key code to the files , the victims must be money - usually in the form of Cr@@ yp@@ sies Bit@@ coin .
however , where private users found the personal photo database on the game , it comes to companies with sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production is shut down .
accordingly , the damage increases if an R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware ski@@ pped .
22 percent of the affected German companies reported net sales by R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware , 13 percent had to break even the business activities completely , in case of being in Fat@@ al .
several hospitals have already been threatened by attacks in Germany , whose patients can be threatened by the loss of n@@ ac@@ ulture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say always to the victims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is it not paying , you only promotes the problem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies that are paying , their data will be back .
for managers , it is difficult to re@@ lie@@ ve the demand of perpet@@ rators in the company in view of a stand@@ still level .
h@@ ack@@ ers again know that and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the F @-@ Secure safety for@@ ger have examined and come in contact with the press and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
they explain their victims to chat as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , freely accessible support sites , or de@@ cryp@@ t for free example files .
and , individuals will be redeemed by payments of a few hundred billion euros , companies must pay part hard to negoti@@ ate and five @-@ digit sum@@ s to receive their data .
given the potential high and relatively ris@@ ky profits from the R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware pur@@ ification , the h@@ acker are always professional and share the work , explained security professionals Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ewski from the Internet provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware about within a week . &quot;
it is likely to be more likely that it is three or four people .
the program@@ mers sell their damage software then in the form of a software modular to the actual er@@ press@@ er .
the existing malware kits developed by malware , consulting and additional tools for one @-@ time , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the scope of delivery includes a adjustment tool , so that smaller configurations , appearance and bran@@ ding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ewski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ex@@ presses are looking for a further h@@ acker to spread the newly purchased software under the victims .
we live in service industry .
so , in one of the for@@ ums in the underground , the set of a crimin@@ als buys a further order to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
payment is made at an independent calcul@@ ator .
&quot; typically , the crimin@@ als apply sp@@ ammer with the spread , &quot; Wis@@ ni@@ ewski explains .
meanwhile , the risk of R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware is now known by many companies that provide their data better .
over 50 percent of companies IT managers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ie survey will trust that R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware by file back @-@ ups and sc@@ ann@@ er@@ Software can rely on it .
accordingly , the perpet@@ rators were pursu@@ ing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the encryption of data alone does not have sufficient threat to successful replacement parts , the perpet@@ rators instead , with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or prize calendar , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes @-@ Chef Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , the damage potential of data is still more times higher than before .
the perpet@@ rators could even take new goals on the internet of things in the future .
on the h@@ ack@@ er@@ conference Def@@ con demonstrated security for@@ ger , how to get it with the connected thermo@@ stat under their control .
in the middle of winter , the her@@ nia of a der@@ art block@@ aded heating could be worth a rans@@ om .
when the perpet@@ rators then block the entire production street in a factory instead of the heating in the future , R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware could also become a theme in Industry 4.0 .

Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and effective .
in the small HR @-@ V , Honda will pack all un@@ packing : a little SUV , a little cou@@ pe and even the versat@@ ility of a min@@ iv@@ ans .
sounds pretty over@@ load , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , has actually been extremely flexible in everyday life as an extremely flexible .
although only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , passengers both have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the Frank@@ fort .
the interior space of the inner floor are well finished and work comfortably , only the cockpit @-@ top falls off .

it is not only a trunk door of 453 l at top and 10@@ 26 l when folded back @-@ folded back re@@ ject , but there are the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; .
this is less mag@@ ically , as it sounds : the seat areas of the rear bench can be lifted like Kin@@ os@@ essel and offer the storage space , which is up to 1,@@ 24 m high ceilings .
the boot is well loaded , but the load height with 650 mm is slightly higher than in the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
he is likely to teach his work somewhat qui@@ eter .
the everyday consumption is 4.7 l / 100 km .

better traffic flow on the fre@@ eway
it st@@ owed regularly on the street road - here a picture from November .
but this should change : the de@@ fle@@ x@@ ural strength is to be extended .
this is a good news for all motor@@ cyclists who stand in the job at the ambient road every evening in St@@ au , when they drive over the auto@@ bahn ( A 43 ) .
the Street construction company extends on the coming Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the Hammer Street and the exit Wes@@ eler Street , the right @-@ carrying track by 700 meters .
drivers can then go directly from the Hammer Street to the right .
the great advantage : the traffic will benefit early , making the aggregate expenditure on the driving section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 is improved .
the idea for the extended exit had the CDU faction in the district of representation Münster @-@ West .
the lane at the Zu@@ br@@ inger nerv@@ ous the drivers especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days the back goes back to the bridge over the Hin@@ slo@@ ping way , and sometimes also beyond .
reason is the needle &apos;s eye on the B 51 shortly before the exit Wes@@ eler Street .
from here the traffic will be left only once a track on the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be back over a good three @-@ quarter years ago .
the reason : static calculations have shown that the bridge does not have the required load capacity to include the heavy duty of heavy goods .
how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the associated vic@@ tu@@ ous St@@ au can not say , the competent state can not say .
however , it is to be reck@@ oned with years : for the bridge has an official remains until 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal fle@@ x@@ ural strength , the state @-@ operation has been deliber@@ ately sought for the school holidays in the school holidays because with disabilities .
the traffic will be passing a track on Tuesday and Wednesday on Wednesday .
intercultural journey : cultural offers for schools

relaxing Night : tips against sleep disorders
in the evening you turn around forever , at night there is time for hours in the morning , in the morning it is not enough to think of sleep .
it &apos;s all other than relaxing .
after all , one is associated with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adult sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces and more than ten percent can be used to sleep or lasting longer than not relaxing .
how can sleep problems or sleep problems ?
there are several forms of sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces , and it can be destroyed many causes , emphas@@ izes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ e@@ ß , member of the German Society for Sle@@ ff@@ ing and Sle@@ ep Medicine .
however , what is under@@ going on it , however , the In@@ som@@ nia is never f@@ ere , thus an in@@ let and flow .
just the pier@@ cing , many people as harm@@ less or in@@ adequate , Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht says Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ir@@ cht , member of the German Haus@@ medical association with practice in Lower Saxony .
what &apos;s behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
it can be organic , mental or behavi@@ our@@ able factors , but also simply plug@@ ged medic@@ ations .
not rare is the bo@@ ther@@ ing disorder of another condition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awak@@ ening is often occurring with a depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ e@@ ß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it may be that various factors require each other .
those who has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc can be po@@ or@@ ly aw@@ akes , wake up every two to three hours and begins to gre@@ et more than everyday problems and care to gre@@ et , there is an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
from when should I contact the doctor ?
those who sleep over a period of one month in at least three nights per week should not sleep well and is imp@@ aired on the day should be at a doctor .
the impair@@ ment can be completely different : one can be beaten up , tired , in@@ hat@@ ched , has difficulties with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical complaints such as mag@@ or or head@@ aches .
in order to alle@@ vi@@ ate the sleep distur@@ bing , it is important to determine their causes .
as treatment options , amongst others behavi@@ our@@ al changes , a cogn@@ itive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or other medic@@ ations - traditional sleeping tablet only occurs in the case and at the most for two weeks - in@@ quiries .
established in Germany , it is hardly under@@ scores Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ esta , director of the inter@@ disciplinary medicine at the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
that is why , in case of sleep problems , you should turn to the hom@@ est@@ ologist , We@@ e@@ ß .
the problems may clari@@ fy whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should put into sleep laboratory , and what happens there ?
for the examination in the sleep laboratory , medical advice , for example , with respir@@ atory ag@@ ility , in case of illness , or if you do not find the cause of a sleeping trou@@ bl@@ esho@@ oting , explains Fi@@ esta .
we do not need to prepare for this examination .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; only do not make any lun@@ ch@@ ings , &quot; says Fi@@ esta .
after being shortened to its normal time , you &apos;ll go to bed .
in addition to the electrodes on the body you can connect one nose , a chest strap and a anten@@ n@@ ae on the finger .
in addition , a camera is also drawn on the ceiling .
how can I get the problems in the handle ?
there are quite many locking screws where you can set for a better sleep .
We@@ e@@ ß counts on : regular sleep and rise times , not too long in bed , not sleep on the day , not watching television to sleep , alcohol depart , and at night not at the clock - then it begins to charge instantly , and that &apos;s all and not eligible .
what the jung@@ le camp with lack of med@@ alli@@ sts in swimming
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus D@@ ei@@ bler referred to the dis@@ appo@@ inting end of the DS@@ V teams at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 he won gold medal for the first time in Doha and presented his first world record at the same time .
now , the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ let Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has taken care in front of his Ex @-@ team @-@ mates in the criticism .
&quot; in a country where an Olympic champion rewarded 20,000 € Premium and a jung@@ le @-@ head 150,000 € should not be about missing medals , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on Friday on his Facebook page .
the feed system in the swimming pool is bad , the d@@ op@@ ing@@ controls are very good .
with this , we cannot compete with countries who do not promote much and do not see it in the topic of d@@ oping or even use it .
&quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls should be set up here , &quot; he explained on .
if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , D@@ ei@@ bler would have to be reported for nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
it is also possible to keep it with countries .

airport : Ban@@ de of Bag@@ di@@ am arrested
professional th@@ iev@@ es at the Airport Düsseldorf
civil society of the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer Police managed to capture two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years .
the susp@@ ects were committed as a ban@@ anas with multiple ash@@ ore and luggage lock@@ ers .
against 21.@@ 30 civil servants in the area of Düsseldorf &apos;s airport , a ban@@ anas were again known to the polic@@ emen from the past theft .
the two women and two men had committed several Del@@ ic@@ ans since the middle of July this year and were ch@@ illed in community , working and particularly professional .
the specialists in the crime miss@@ ariat 34 can ut@@ ili@@ ze the de@@ pl@@ est , who had traveled to Germany in the survey of criminal off@@ ences to Germany .
they took a total of more than 15.000 euros .
Alt@@ buil@@ ded , a few lin@@ den baths , in between still a rest head@@ stone pav@@ ement : the Rig@@ a@@ er Street in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain works on the first look , but the police is one of the dangerous places in the city .
go along the street from east to west , one is passing playing places , a refresh@@ ed kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ kers over .
on the facade of a grey house someone has ug@@ ly ! &quot; spra@@ yed . &quot;
opposite of a Li@@ dl , which will soon be demolished , it will already be built : by 2017 there is a house with high windows and 133 new apartments .
article about this &quot; trendy district , &quot; like the competent property company Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain , will be preferred in the last weeks however with burning cars .
the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the inhabitants of rent , on the ground floor there are still spaces occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , in particular , the Berlin interior of Berlin had several occasions for a tough approach to the project , the area referred to as a &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schm@@ ie@@ de , had been evacu@@ ated three weeks from official statements , according to 30 to 40 civil servants and three team cars on site , locked up parts of the street and stayed visitors to enter the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile , renovated construction workers on behalf of the unknown house owner the rooms .
on 13 July , a Berlin administration decided that the clearance had been illegal , and a day later , police and workers passed under the Ju@@ bel of sympath@@ izers and residents .
on this summer afternoon , the street is peace@@ fully : parents walk with children , people sit on the brush set before the houses in the sun , others keep going di@@ ät@@ i .
in the immediate vicinity of the skin projects there are primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
left hand is not the main concern of many residents : K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the &quot; Kie@@ z &quot; since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who has been here three children , are mainly generated by police presence .
with the inhabitants of the hood , they share the care in front of increasing coun@@ ters and genetic diagnosis .
it doesn &apos;t sound after a Kie@@ z , who wish to w@@ ished the majority of police in a v@@ and@@ al@@ izing left .
the tr@@ ench , den of the Berlin interior and the police between shel@@ ters and their neigh@@ bors , obviously not exist .
Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain in the East Berlin was actually a traditional labor quarter that also today has a lower average of poverty in comparison to the rest of the city .
the number of residential projects also belong to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kie@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including nearly the whole Main road quite close to the Rig@@ a@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the Main police had been cleared under great police forces , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ id and are still inhabited by people who had occupied them 26 years ago .
at the same time , the district has become increasingly become the mag@@ nets of all over the world in recent years : with them , residents of GDR times and former house occupied their Kie@@ z .
this is also noticeable during the rental period , which has risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009 .
many of the new@@ buildings in the Rig@@ s are being attacked as symbols for these developments : one recogni@@ zes them in raised discs or fresh@@ ly kn@@ itted fac@@ ades which were subjected to paints .
no other street was mentioned as often along with the words &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence . &quot;
a reason for this , that not all neighbours must be considered a problem , that they are not necessarily affected by the crime . according to off@@ ence , statistics are almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
the largest part of criminal off@@ ences make the damage of atomic facts , who tend to meet the newly built and newly renovated houses .
for K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives for 17 years in a rental house next to the controversi@@ al 94 , cannot be talking about un@@ certainty .
there is a violent man : the people in the 94 are their neigh@@ bors who have not been determined .
also the famous burning cars will give it directly to the Riga already longer .
for the studied archit@@ ect@@ in , her street is not a criminal fir@@ ing , on the contrary : &quot; here you can get one another , along the road and get more each other than what else . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliber@@ ately drawn into the Riga street - and stayed .
this is why it was so important that the inhabitants of the city will return to their streets : from the police , politics and the media , which has suddenly taken the interpretation of the city in July .
but in the eyes of residents such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the street will continue to be taken away : through heal@@ th@@ less new buildings in former buildings that twi@@ sted the ancient inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so are the con@@ domin@@ iums , which are not interesting for many people - there are more people living here , who are not so good things , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says she . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; violence and Dest@@ ru@@ ction can I not gu@@ ill@@ ate . &quot;
but what should one do if you never listen to someone ?
it places fru@@ stration among all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants .
for mapping that anno@@ yed over colour bombs , K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer becomes little understanding : the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the &quot; Kie@@ z . &quot;
who attracts , should be aware of - just like someone who draws to a K@@ nei@@ pen@@ se area , can be easily compl@@ ained about noise .
all persons only presented with pre@@ names are asked to be called not to be called by their right name
Ur@@ bach : An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is a new refugee community
An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact partner in terms of integration and organis@@ ator .
in addition she is a social worker .
since July An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the refugee camp for Ur@@ bach .
the social ped@@ agog@@ y supports the team of administration around Ach@@ im Gro@@ ws .
it sees itself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , workers , refugee assistance , administration , authorities , and who else is not included .
RE@@ G@@ INE client of the employer indicates that the volunte@@ er are than@@ k@@ ful to be than@@ k@@ ful , that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now , the ins@@ ane wo@@ k plants , which has a problem in particular .
so some - less mo@@ cked as a rather re@@ warding to the multitude of problems - meant as the administration wanted to re@@ write the place .
we sought an administration of administrative with a talent for tongues and people , connected with a long @-@ year experience in the field of social work , but a heavy wo@@ k plants .
yet administration is not its central area , An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , it is about organization , working with the people on site and also behind the scenes and network activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been in existence for around six weeks .
it has a 50 @-@ percent spot on three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine Client that An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le Ehr@@ or and Security &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was supported . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are large and small problems , organiz@@ ational , human and communication problems .
soon there are new containers in the Was@@ en@@ straße
there has been a great problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting pl@@ ough@@ s that have been recognized .
the municipal authorities are responsible for the connection output .
they must accommodate refugees in their own or rented rooms .
the cost of construction , the rent or renov@@ ations of these accommodation must bear the municipalities themselves .
the responsibility goes from the Land@@ rat@@ ory , municipality and Job@@ center .
problem : there are free objects , but not each owner wants to offer his apartment .
the search have been very difficult for some time .
de fac@@ to is not able to manage private apartments .
it did not work yet to be conf@@ used to private apartments , as Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , new homes must be not@@ orious , as it is so beautiful .
so soon new container will be installed in the Was@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the key@@ word , Reg@@ ine customer and An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a fixed lead , intern@@ ships , training places , one @-@ euro jobs and staff activities for refugees and migrants who need to be frozen or set up .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine customer .
many work in the farm or assist household , do @-@ in @-@ profit work - and the motiv@@ ated and very ti@@ dy , as An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
it hopes that the work of the community leads to a positive external effect .
that is &quot; no employment treatment . &quot;
activity doesn &apos;t mean work .
the day require a solid structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
human beings would have to develop an increase .
so there are offers like sport , contacts with loc@@ als and especially Spanish courses .
professional courses are ra@@ r .
so you can also ski@@ p here administration and volunteers .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome in Germany and welcome .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
they have to explain the refugees that it will take and allow them to be able to reach the time , for example , with language courses .
those who like the feeling he could help in Ur@@ bach , he could not work in Ur@@ bach , do not work , and be un@@ profitable who will never be in@@ corporate .
the distinct majority are motiv@@ ated .
problem cases , however , will be hon@@ est , &quot; people , with whom even nothing goes . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others .
all this is quite a &quot; Mamm@@ ut@@ task . &quot;
a difficult question : did both fear the recent inci@@ dents in front of radi@@ cal@@ ization , also in a small municipality like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine client quite clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what lack of n@@ ai@@ v &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; a risk can I could not exclu@@ de it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sen@@ si@@ can be the hel@@ pers already .
these inci@@ dents have also been subject to refugees .
they had the fear that the assassination attempt to call them completely in order .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine Client . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would glad@@ ly stay in ur@@ bach .
thus main and honour must be paid on site and in the region according to activities .
in the background they always have a new stores to refugees and migrants to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a upper limit ?
to answer this question , the policy is known .
actually it is un@@ fair to put them hel@@ pers on site .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we are not there where we would like , &quot; says An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
no new refugees , that would be able to relax .
RE@@ G@@ INE customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ b@@ acher already fully util@@ ized that human beings are reas@@ on@@ ably reasonable .
there are currently around 100 people , mostly young men .
but when people are in need , one must help them , both women are in@@ ig .
the political world situation is so complicated , there is no simple answers .
