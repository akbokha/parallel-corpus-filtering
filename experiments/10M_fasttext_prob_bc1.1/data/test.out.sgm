<seg id="1">Clincke and Trumps Economic Policy in Comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and prevent the trade agreement TTP - which want to be Clinton as well as Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US Presidential applicants is based on the tax and energy policy as well as in a basic question.</seg>
<seg id="4">Differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are a fundamental, more philosophical difference being destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="5">He, about the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to hold the doubt rather small and warns, as the state of the economy could harm - with taxes and regulators.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wool to control the economy and regulate the economy, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself would be entirely different, claims Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will make them massively, and he makes himself strong tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton says: the state has given certain tasks, he has announced opportunities to open and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore, taxes for the rich would increase, says it.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both very close to the topic of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the final one must be invested, Trump and Clinton had almost wortted.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are rejected by the state-ritual Teaparty-wing of the Republican strikt.</seg>
<seg id="16">So on drunky, so many internal discussions could come.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policies are significant.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and drive the coal production in the USA again.</seg>
<seg id="19">In now protected areas, oil extraction should also be possible to terminate the climate agreement in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="20">In contrast, Clinton wants to expand renewable energies with its investment program: "a country will create the superpower of clean energies and create millions jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will be either China, Germany or America - I want that we are."</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in the infrastructure - even at international trade agreements the two competitors are not too far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the Real-fish trade agreements, do not want to sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both the United States don't want to isolate the U.S. by international trade - but simply protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">These should then be paid even better, for Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The present minimum wage of 7,25 US dollars is a hungry wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to $15 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do this question is not clear: once he says: the minimum wage has to be, then he says he may not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months is likely to develop in order to develop the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one hand, Trump, who wants to reload the economy and citizens to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics stop him, so the budgetary deficit would only be greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton who want to ask at least of the rich, that they will pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="2">Sexual violence is among women who flee to almost daily life.</seg>
<seg id="3">When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatised.</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">Four women sitting in a large kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each has a baby, which is at most one year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has laid their young son in the arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He guesses with big eyes neugig in the room.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother rigid on the table top.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until they noticed that it is observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiled short and kissed the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene seems normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until one speaks with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">She is a division manager of Condrobs, a sponsor for social aid offers in Bavaria, and deals with the subject of women on the run.</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are ploughing.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the Munich north in one of the few decentralised accommodations for all participating women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January, Condrobs made up the institution together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Office.</seg>
<seg id="18">It has been officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">Men are not there - also not as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a watchman before the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who comes here has done on her escape experiences with sexual violence," says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee because of wars, because they are politically persecuted because of them death or death, because they send their families a hopeful to Europe," she tells them.</seg>
<seg id="24">Among women there were many reasons for the run: "many steal themselves secretly for the flight, because they don't see any other way."</seg>
<seg id="25">In her homeland they have made experience with sexual violence, forced laboratorial, slavery or forced prostitution.</seg>
<seg id="26">That drives them off.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "for example, tugboat for a bottle of water require sexual action is no rarity," "" "says Bahr." ""</seg>
<seg id="29">And women are alone, they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">Who think that the end as soon as they come into Germany, irre, tells Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="31">Too, all women among refugee families would have often regarded as mineas and worse and worse.</seg>
<seg id="32">This means that around 90 percent of women who live in the accommodation of the Munich north are traumatised in the accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not voluntary."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are there such that they say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "or they don't trust, open on the earth, because the shame is too great." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">Since they often did not get to help you need more accommodation only for them, calls Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Bavaria, the seven regional governments are responsible for the establishment of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the question whether they were similar to a similar project, as in Munich in her state of jurisdiction, they reply some with no.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the Oberpfalz region and Oberfranken, there are not something in voluntary governments.</seg>
<seg id="40">Even in Schwaben, women alone are not accommodated alone, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press Officer of the government.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Central franken, there are only two floors or their own houses for all women and their children.</seg>
<seg id="42">The exception is Lower Bavaria, there are two central accommodations only for women.</seg>
<seg id="43">The "Rights of Women and Gender Equality" in the European Parliament is calling for women to be accommodated separately from men.</seg>
<seg id="44">In a study published for the committee, it is said: "it is very important that men and women are separated separately."</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "lack the privacy or are accommodated together, it can come to - persistent - violence against women" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Especially the shower room should be separately accessible and for women easily accessible, is in the study.</seg>
<seg id="47">How much the women of this protection needs to be felt, you can read on the Andalucía who gives it to the house in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="48">"since it has been spoken that there are a long waiting list," says Bahr.</seg>

<seg id="2">Assistant representatives of the assistant doctors have called their union to approve new workhorse measures in their disputes regarding a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has requested its entire advice from the beginning of September more workhorse measures.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leader of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce their hands and make an official end of the eight months in continuous war of the words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin took his Turkish counterplayer in the gilded Hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I can't forbid that Ankara wants to destroy these reconciliation in most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the manual, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin was narrowly worked narrowly and he radiated warmth, even for his repeating conditions.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke about his" "" "dear friend" "" "according to a report whole five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to its old level before the crisis, but can still improve even better.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day a newspaper described that Erdogan would have thought so would never happen to happen.</seg>
<seg id="11">His enthusiasm seemed to indicate the opposite of my enthusiasm.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's daring, sustainable cooling showed that the State of Russia had not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the crisis of crisis was the first, what he mentioned in his introductory remarks: the surplus of a Russian fighter aircraft at the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow reaction to the time was wutrified.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared Putin and accused Ankara to be in the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">That was even bigger, as it was committed by a promised friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Vetropes will be difficult, if not even impossible to become impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media led a sharp, unrestricted attack against Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">Once it seemed to be, the Turks would bear the iniquity for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">The serious civil servants, that Erdogans have benefited their own family from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria, which will be controlled from the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He fought this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look back to the front.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the President Erdogan the excuse that he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">To Ankara lie the benefits of an armisture clearly on the hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan needs to be primarily associated with all friends who he can get after last month at a failed coup d'etat of his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terror attacks on Turkey also have shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions are hard hit Turkey - particularly the ban of charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number is gone by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, travel companies and charter companies are facilitated when the flights resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a subsequent aisle storm of the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week projected cable-cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural exports are allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">A report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows: "tourists there long, tomatoes for long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is raged in the West as it was the response to the attempted power of power than a weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">For this purpose, the continued Groll pass through the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pike is to take advantage of the cool mood and to reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">In Ankara, Russian president won security in Ankara with security that he asked the attempted coup d "état support for the chosen state of state.</seg>
<seg id="40">That is well pleased for Moscow, a self-intelligibility, which himself has a prositting fear of Regimeering.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit meeting in this glittering palace made by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey, one how it seems to introduce a analyst, "Alliance of outsiders": two countries, which are cast off from the West and feel poorly treated.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still big differences between the two still big differences.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave the role as a peace-point, but to support Russia and Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be recording that after almost three hours of first discussions on the press conference, they said that they had not taken the topic once.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey agreed to answer a question concerning their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize this.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus about it, where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after the months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster as NATO member of the Russian Battle jet, it is certainly better that the two state heads talk at least once again.</seg>

<seg id="5">In an opinion of the Kremlin it reads that Putin was arranged for the release of Ivanovs by his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidium Administration. "</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who joined Ivanovs in 2012, was appointed to his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital of Tallinn, he graduated from the renowned Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the website of the Kremlin it is called (in Russian) that he later referred the log of log and Staff Manager of the government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said to Putin:" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the most important role of the government to assist your activity as a state Secretary with Legislative Decree and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov has asked to leave his post and recommended to Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Persuade the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has been mysteriously Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergey Ivanov was a long time in the close of Vladimir Putin and works as he works for the Soviet Intelligence Service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcasted on TV, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff came to his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the exacerbation of the cameras, just a few of them are convinced - especially in front of the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So here is the result of a kind of power dispute?</seg>
<seg id="20">This is no one knows.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official claim - that a man who once again proved to be a potential President, who would like to guide the Russian environmental policy - fell to big skepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks on Putin, cited on the website of the Kremlin, Ivanov, "it's true that I asked you in early 2012 in a conversation to tell me this very complicated post - one could almost say - to use this post for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it states, I have been chairman of the Russian chairperson for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov resumed the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin's former member of the State Security Service of KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), he was appointed the KGB, Ivanov was appointed chairman of his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power he called Ivanov as one of five people, which he trusted in the most.</seg>
<seg id="29">It was assumed that Ivanov could be President of Russia to Putin's second term, as a third term of Putin would have cast off to the Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this item was taken by another opponent, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin was Prime Minister before he became President of three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the flow between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a heigle activity which require extremely precise tolerances for fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">Altogether, almost 79% of the total bridge decks in their place and the last stretch of Decks gets a concrete finish for the deck, which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted up on the bridge to its place.</seg>

<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenager and child for games do not go beyond outside, but rather preferring their leisure time to spend on screens, has been proclaim in the last decade of many.</seg>
<seg id="4">At Pokemon Go, people go to take people from the sofa and to be more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time at the screen was initially displayed on the TV, then play video games and last on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">So it's great to see that technology and activities are not out in the open.</seg>
<seg id="7">I'm playing of course on the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that was created on the characters that were created for the video games in the 1990s (later developed a cartoon animation, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">How many phenomena of pop culture sank the interest in front of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed by massive demand that overload the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within less days, Pokémon Go has more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, the players go out with their smart phones and searching for Pokémons that were followed by a GPS as soon as they were found once, "photographed" (via a screenshot on the mobile phone) or "taken prisoner."</seg>
<seg id="13">One generation that played the game when she was still younger, joined the winding and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>

<seg id="15">Cardiver, an app for Apple Watch, who followed 35,000 users, divided the Washington Post recently with that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of people followed every day 30 minutes, from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>

<seg id="17">"" "many public awareness programmes for health, people want to bring to" "" "to come to" "", "of the sofa" "", "and" "" "to be active every day," "" "because many public messages are bored for health and come from people who look like." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be assessed.</seg>
<seg id="19">Who regularly drives sports, reduces his chances to ill cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of advantages, which is too long to run them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful of Pokémon Go is that there is people to do something in the open, that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus three columns of health covered - movement, fresh air, sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people close the hunt even new friends.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there is mürric gameplay, which must always be complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it mean?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps had already able to follow our activity earlier than Fitbit, they gave us no reason to exercise sports, as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its maturity and use it with the time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, due to Pokemon's success, there will be more games that can join apps and virtual reality with the activist in the real world and will be able to help many people on the hunt, more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie initially beat all the same way like Aly and Madison to create it to the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "Last Five," because the next Olympics will only have four gymnants in the team. furthermore, the last year with Marta Karolyi was as a trainee.</seg>
<seg id="18">But reality looks so that gymnastic sports is a expensive sport and Turner first place in private gyms, which are calculated for the training, integration, travel, clothing, clothing and hotel costs (for the trainer and their Turner and families). the list can be displayed as desired.</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these turntables are located in wealthy suburbs that can support business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs, Turner will receive a whole workout and that is for the families a most expensive and long-term commitment.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainee by Laurie Hernandez, both have trained their athletes, since they started with the Turnen.</seg>
<seg id="22">We must be innumerable to the municipalities of Aun countless, young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a strong and easy-to-reach turnaround.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British travel reasoning his immune system and troughness of a serious exam - leaving some of the most dirty places of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and itautor Ian Wright, 51, made from Suffolk its course on a euro banknotes, a railing at the Piccadilly Circus, a scaling toilet and a public telephone in Russia to demonstrate the resistance to its immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before demolition any object it used a luminometer to show up and show us what it is left.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, titled "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results of daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought that rinsing the insing knob of a pull-toilet, which was used already by thousands of others, may be completely detectable, but indeed there are more poor bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical specialists in the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Luckily did not leave what he leaked, more than a bad retaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright has been known to test the resistance of his gut by the world, where he travelled through the world and ate strange things as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public funds at railway stations till the rinsing knobs of toilets, the task was definite the immune system definitely under a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he told: "as a child I was relatively unconcerned about what my health was about and I have put all possible things in my mouth, earth, worms and sludge."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was justified with his reputation in the film.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he was leaning, was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His prosthesis showed a luminance of over 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">In comparison, the Luminometry is freshly washed hands less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet which he refused to refuse after its Luminometric number was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have a less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the bacterias number in different locations like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">In the film, he says: "this is the worst, what I smoked in a toilet, near."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing dirt than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not laugh here because it is inside or inconical.</seg>
<seg id="21">"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company stet Mr. Wright with Valio Geography, which contains both Lactobacilli as well as vitamin C and D to support the support of intestinal bacteria and immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Validation Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vujenmaa says: "we wanted to have something new to consumers.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time the advantages of Probiotics explains.</seg>
<seg id="25">We conducted a mad Brainstormings that concluded that we said "Let us call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in the intestinal health will become a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of just over the products we wanted to put it into a larger context - the good and poor bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of the intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">Growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide the consumer more information on an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "Tom Hakala, who led the direction of the film, said:" "" "let it be said," "" "I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he had suffered some of the things I have instructed him, such as the most beautiful Russian toilet which is shown in the film" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things, with which it was easier to bring Ian, she anzilateral and others, where this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad that we recorded some of these dirty lads on movie. "</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio conducted by 84 percent of all respondents of Lactobacilli in particular with the benefactors of stomach and intestines and 58 per cent said they are using at least occasionally products that include the enclosed lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: locals get nothing from the summer campaign with - and the holiday from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country.</seg>
<seg id="3">They understood in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="4">2021 will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays at the end of the summer holidays.</seg>
<seg id="5">As far as until now, it is not: summer holidays, heat and land heats - that bites.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals that are to be impressed by the electors, are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the tourists who are in the country are on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not a native, so may not choose the country's day.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are practical problems: in the holidays, helpers, posters hang on, air balloons, flyers, and drove to them by the end of the vote, just laboured.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until September 4, 2016, the election and last day of the day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to pass over the people's election campaign once again.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say it at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it also goes to something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition, has to be afraid.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting how strongly Neuling AfD will cut and what remains difficult for the end of the end.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 head of head, makes an almost unobtrusive campaign, one sees his grandparents.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels across the country, spread, and plueth a little with men, as it is already his legendary advertiser Harald Ringstorff.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise, sailors have got cold feet and Chancellor Merkel blame the blossom of the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their refugee policy, her "We are creating the" Ascension of the spooopoists, what's thought to do it now.</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with her top-edge data, the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced, as it is, if you make the right time at the right place of election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has been invited twice as a Chancellor Angela Merkel; Merkel's federal circuit lies in the northeast.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree that there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as the Mecklenburg-Westphalia and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"there was probably the majority of other federal states," accused of Vincent Kokert, General Secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern more recently in NDR.</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's a shame even anyone from the other corners of Germany, who Angela Merkel can listen to Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">Otherwise, the Nordost-CDU explores largely on the common constituencies in marketplaces and in front of shopping centers with parasols and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">This is, cocaine, and plays only a "minor role."</seg>
<seg id="25">Even the Union has noted that in the country the base had the base so that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people.</seg>
<seg id="26">You are like the left, the SPD, the Green Party: hardly exists in the times of the country.</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the Council of the CDU-Elepher Kokert to his fellowsoldier is however also self-explanatory: "you have to go where it is doing, wherever the people are: Dorffeste, Golden weddings, each birthday party must be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">Because a lot on the game stands, Sellering has now called his SPD on a particularly committed election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In polls, the Socialists and Democrats continue with 22 percent behind partners CDU (25) and just under the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">In the election in 2011 the SPD gained clearly at 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The green, party with seven percent in the polls, make the jump in the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern day out of the holiday emergency, refresh their selfancy share into the internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"online campaign" is called the Presidents Claudia Müller.</seg>
<seg id="34">Otherwise, walkers rely on trace elements, seeking local stimuli, among the tourists.</seg>
<seg id="35">Silke Gajek, the leading edge, curvt straight with a house boat due to the Mecklenburg-Mecklenburg lakes, and finds it even nice too.</seg>
<seg id="36">Your impression: "election holidays in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is no punishment."</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination records: who actually buys sound plates?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men of middle age love panels.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before joining the commiteil, in order to overseeding him under the pseudonym non-ribbon age of age, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to Yougov, it is not the most discussed rebuilding of sound plates on a boom in millennials that would like to welcome the rejection of physical objects, but back to Midlife-Nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all foresight according to the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">Indeed, the age group of 18-24 is the most likely buyer group.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a Horden by hobbyers - it has a emotional meaning: older record buyers will retain their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it alone time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But does the results vote by YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog would be a news report on TV, I would follow the camera, while I will keep my hands in the middle of a busy street in Soho, before I stop my hands and keep something amazing like: "so let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So let us take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart of SoHos is slowly linked to its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once, independant sellers have been located, there are as a handful of fantastic record shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the camera program to turn off the camera for the next part, in which I am standing near to different men in such stores and try to assess your age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I am from Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three men of middle age) in Reckless Records (data number: eight men of middle age, a woman, probably around the 20) sequence is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">These record panels, above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I'm not followed at home), clothe walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of his available income: it is now able to buy plates that he could not afford to buy [them] and again objects, which he sold, when he sold young and compleite.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy, are from the late '60s, early' 70s, which appeared, when I was 11 or 12. things I probably was too young to buy them," says he.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is true that those who buy boards, rather chained and would like to spend some time, and adds: "I smoke not, and I drink not much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my scaster.</seg>
<seg id="22">Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, believes that many customers who meets the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the Medienhpe, people who have heard about the comeback and decided to buy their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of the talks, which I have led, people usually have disposed of their collection in 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs, now sell their CDs to buy themselves their records. "</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom on followers of a specific age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the innable emotional significance of slabs?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a business like phonica to detect that record shops offers a soothing community of equality.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to Wez, some of the previous clients participated in the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some disk fans will be overwhelmed by the digital world and want to draw back to the stability of confided silencer, from objects, the happenviable viviations.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think, sometimes it can be the colt of a void or property of possessions as a type of comfort," says Wez.</seg>
<seg id="32">That's with me as a collector, and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal with spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social worker!" "" "killed one employee from a record stack." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of the ICM in April reveal that almost 50% of people who have bought a record has not yet been heard.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% possess a turntable that they never use, while 7% of those who buy a plate, do not own record players.</seg>
<seg id="37">At that point of the news report, I would like to look very worried, while I bluish a stack of Bossa Nova compilations through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works with sounds of the Universe (data number: three men of middle age) has worked on a "trophy of" the Revival. "</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came only recently here and said," I have no record player, but I would like to buy them a radiohead sound plate, so I'd like to set them into the shelf. "</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a large percentage, but it's definitely happening.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less musicling.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I have no record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">Those are younger people, not older, that come slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Opp that has been dedicated to the sound plates almost a whole floor, has a blower audience, than I cleans.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and women of middle ages.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is slightly relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops, Wild Beasts's latest Synthesis and right-right pop instead of experimental jazz drillers from the loudspeakers - is it good to see such diversity to the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them sees strange indeed, but nagious traumata are hard to conceivable, if one stands for about 30 seconds in addition to someone.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around the business for some minutes and considered the variability of the plates that are available for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">She rather makes a shutter bumper in a big shopping.</seg>
<seg id="50">It doesn't deserves much, therefore the Collecting of records are not a real option, says she.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to listen to music from a computer or to other way, but the beauty of slabs'... they drives with a sigh sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it is truly unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a store that is said that a new generation of record lovers have to be inspired: urban outjig.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I admit to count the jeans-Hotpants, I observe a group of young teenager who grouped for a moment around Polaroid cameras, before a father and his daughter superior to buy a Crosley player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left there is a staircase, a wall full of plates from Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a blend of contemporary music and classics that are essential for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one sees her - perhaps because they are only purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to deal with them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that every attraction for these objects would mean more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of sohos for more, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">There is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, also the one that is most for luxury items such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my researches showed that the results of YouGov would match them, at least in record shops in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record facilities that exist in reality, business transactions and in Onlineforums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard in school or offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with security in the crumble by record shops of the Berwick Street and the leaves by slabs, while the starred view of an unknown, 30-year-old creator meides that rises not over the shoulders men aged men.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court is rejected by the authorities in Calais, dozens of visional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">In case of hearing this week, the authorities argued that the state should have jurisdiction to sell 72 temporary shops, sale of cigarettes to Energydrinks, selling, hairdressing services or tea for 50 cents (40 Pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The prefecture of Calais argued that these places should be settled down because they would represent a parallel economy out of which no taxes would be paid and that a fire and risk of fire hostels.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups divided the court with that the shops and restaurants are important as the free meals that supported by the state-supported union and other groups, do not provide sufficient foods for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They went out that the visional business and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of people who operate the 72 visional business, but spatially discarded the concerns of Calais prefecture. "</seg>
<seg id="8">The judge Jean François Molla said that the food business, cafes and restaurants would play a lot more important role, than only people live, who live in extremely prevalent conditions. "</seg>

<seg id="10">One of the places that was threatened by the decline was the young Book kids' Café des camp, which is meant-nered and 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as guidance on asylum seekers, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Britain at the 7-er Rugby came in the final on Thursday evening at a rupting stop at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis, when they were beaten up with a score of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji gave a master class in the handling, Side-Stepping, Afterback, liner and rock strength to win gold - their first Olympic champion every color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was not very proud of the silver medal - Great Britain fourth on that day - and they could quite be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they struck New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Bodies, 7-5 in the semifinal on the same day could fall in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But independently of these, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in the shape.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a comfort for GB - but it probably won't - that at least one Brite will have hanging a gold medal around his neck: Fijis chef coach Ben Ryan, former head of England for Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult road behind it.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago she lost under Ryan every play on Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This canopy becomes weaving, but the progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began admired and made the GBS attacks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt at the Kapitän Tom Mitchell and Co. in driving. the World Series winner went 5-0 to the top, when Osea Kolinisau arrived in the corner rovercrowded.</seg>
<seg id="14">With four minutes of playing time Jerry Tuwai added another attack out of the right corner, which he converted.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly used the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A third goal of Mitchell stops the mountain of Man Leone Nakarawa to get a third goal but it has only stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute Jasa Veremalua in the right corner is a touch down and it was 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new since the re-start and there was still over one minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">VGuatemo Ravouvou developed a lot of weak tacklings of the GB teams and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion carried a 29-0 until the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's like Fiji who was born to play 7 while the GB still learn.</seg>
<seg id="22">So it is too.</seg>
<seg id="23">UK introduced fundamental changes to the half-time and ended the fijivian gap... for a whole four minutes, which was good for the ratios of the first half-period, until Joshua made Tuisova according to a Brilliant intermediate play of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt on GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went long for the southern seeinment, whose fans sang and danced at the grandstand.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not hard to admire the playsite Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the i-door with another attempt in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The plumff sounds, the Fijis impoverished and GB disclosed down in the lawn.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the day Fiji Japan defeated in semi-finals with 20-5 defeated and Great Britain pushed South Africa in a close half match from the race - Great Britain's conversion of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the Bodies in the first half after the front, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footing and scored a gate under the post in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliantly late Tacoma of Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside teams, assured the prize - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by the cancer of the trainee as a rowing victory</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no emotional gold than with these games and that wants to be hot.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first rowing stroke to the last, 220 hard Hieve, who go into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning were an additional significance in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even if there were only those who were sitting at the rudder, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was allpresent at the second Olympics in the two-year-old female without tax nurse, the first women in the history of British sports, who laid on such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolutely, after all of her 39.ed unleaking use, which is also exemplary.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant Athletes which reflects the surface with elegance of weaknesses, which does not reflect the nature of the Arc de Triomphe.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind each gold in the ruins there is a battalion on content helping to make the difference, and there was no one more hilly than the coach that would not survive the difference 30 months ago, if he was diagnosed every day when he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer, the operable and so did it.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do this, he spreads out everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty serious situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It doesn't change a bit.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio had luck that he could be treatment early in early 2014, outside the season, could begin the interruption to a minimum in case that is the right term under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to go back soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was a incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in hospital and ran at the station around - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">It starts like that.</seg>
<seg id="19">The rowing on itself is a challenge, but this makes it a bigger one.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the infertility of victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerved morning to talk a little more than else, trying to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">Stanning who was the captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, "I was this week an emotional wreck. that's perhaps something extremely, but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">It is repeated, how much I mean, how much I and Helen and Robin have worked at this time.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin, nobody would be no one, that's a massive Danke to him. he is the best coach in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I would have no better person for exercising or a better coach.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have lost no race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The pair had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not survive.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even during the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to move up, the anning and Glover had too much in the reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very close at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "lead in the process, stay in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important to let yourself be ripping.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not to do something of rabies.</seg>
<seg id="33">We wanted to give today no fireworks, we wanted to achieve a good result, go out and win the race, what we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take a break before it will meet over his future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glover must appear next week on a wedding in their own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now, just want to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that my last race was.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">In London it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="40">It was all so new for me and I was so stressed.</seg>
<seg id="41">It took about four minutes.</seg>
<seg id="42">That feels so much better, "she said.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Singen has accompanied her whole life: as a young girl, she was in the schoolchoir, in the teaching position she finished the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior senior choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "singing and physical," "" "she moves." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">After one rehearsal it feels balanced, cheerful and a total of alive, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By side, her health and her spirit practises something good.</seg>
<seg id="6">For singing is like from several perspectives: a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler from the German senior liga.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most senior students sing together in chorus, and share the joy in music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular interaction, senior business contacts can take up and maintain.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often, social and family structures in the age on, a chorus is then an ideal place to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: "to arrange and organize, to be able to leave and learn from each other - a choir is a very special shape of consciousness."</seg>
<seg id="11">It is possible to sing in the positive sense, hors hunters.</seg>
<seg id="12">Senior citizens exercise a deep and controlled respiration.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who demands his lungs are regularly challenged, which is not as fast as fast in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even if it comes to get the sound of the voice at age, Singen is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">On older people Singen often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the German labour community of the seniors-organisations.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations, the common singen had a much higher score, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and free time, explains them.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz is often observed that singing or listening of songs in older people have wearoused many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth time.</seg>
<seg id="18">By lyrics and especially melody apart from lyrics, people are aborted by themselves in a long time of events.</seg>
<seg id="19">When singing the head, a special output is required, Lenz is explained.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, focusing on their own voice and to a given rhythm and to adapt to other singers - this is a major cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Just older people who live alone, do not practice, do not only concentrate on itself.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition of which one goes through the singing in chorus, hates Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">A thrilled audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Even the self-esteem is growing by the singing in chorus.</seg>
<seg id="25">Themselves to show itself: if I am long for something, I will get better and watch over me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start with singing, so there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Those who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he think, little talent, may be avenged.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sings alone - at 50 singing people who listens on, if a tone is next to it?</seg>
<seg id="29">Looking for the appropriate offer, Seniors have various possibilities, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">Someone sings from the acquaintance circuit in an icroenchyor, you can simply connect it.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities offer overviews over the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Who wants to sing in a church choir may turn right to the church or church leaders.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior stats can also be found on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Anyone does not have access to the internet, the family, friends or neighbours must ask help for Internet computers.</seg>
<seg id="35">Anyone who wants to sing, shouldn't join a chorus, hates Hackler.</seg>

<seg id="6">And then there are Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women's black with dimples, would have definitely be sent to Prime Time, build by sponsors and well-being-being-advertising when he would be a swimmers, Turner or even Fever.</seg>

<seg id="13">Although the tramp-jump has been an Olympic event since 2000 when it had made his debut in Sydney, it was the last 16 years so many that I had asked, did not know that there is an Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional Ignoranz.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the United States won a contest for the competition, it has never gained a medal in the tramp-jump, and by 2012 it has had a athlete until end-round.</seg>

<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennon from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The tramp-jump has a certain outer side of side, partially because it sounds for the unexplained ear for a clownsschool than those for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At that point I should admit that I'm not an expert, but only a second enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humoristically potential - the cartoonous citations of his never to swollen imprit - but also the grazie of the gym and diving, the two sports that combines it essentially.</seg>

<seg id="23">According to the official Olympiaprograph, you will be evaluated according to execution, difficulty and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Two-undeterologous athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists must continue in their streaks to gold, faster, after top and draught, sometimes up to the target, sometimes, and back, down and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They do not chase the finish line or the pretext, but in the television transmission as well as the TV broadcast: the world or the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="28">The targeted goal is Nobel, admirable, even fanatically - and it is enough to stir even a audience on tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also that, what I even have to look at this games as a bit tired.</seg>
<seg id="30">This trampoline offers a reprieve.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampolines is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A downward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she cries off, seemingly heavy heavios like an astronaut, goes down, then downwards, then effortlessly back up.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during practice there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreaming, elegant cancelled of time and heavy force.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is so Zen as the competition can only be in the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and final round of women will take place on Friday afternoon in the streaming of 13.00 Eastern Time; the men's men on Saturday also around 13.00.</seg>

<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of failure after years of worsening under the surface now explode.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in the last few years, many Ethiopians were able to communicate with the social media, as cheap smart phones were increasingly more common and improved the Internet services.</seg>

<seg id="41">The third reason for the rest is death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was until his death in a non-public disease in 2012 for 17 years of Ethiopia prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was regarded as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>

<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to scatter the last controversy on Friday, referring to his campaign by provoking President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the "founders" of the terrorists of Islamic State, not serious.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification threw new questions on the communication skills of the presidential candidate of the Republicans if it is capable of communicating and understandable with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also takes its mitigators who endeavoured him to take him during an eventful phase in protection, to explain the peculiar position to declare that he could not have meant.</seg>
<seg id="5">After winning the signing in a campaign event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump was made in terms of the assertion on Thursday and consisted in interviews on Thursday that he really did not intend to interpret the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early mordial Mr. Trump, he was simply ssarist.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tweeter was contrary to the previous day, in which Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he meant being completely serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump help him weaknesses the statement by telling him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican candidate candidate knew nothing of it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism were down to Mr. Trump, while he tries to redirect the focus on the economic situation due to his campaign.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches for the economic situation in Michigan in this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday, Mr. Trump tried again to return on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="12">On Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton would result in higher taxes and found that he found their talk about boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump did not present sarcasm for his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he moved to criticism when he thought the Russians should be Mrs. Clinton's emails. but he later declared "Of course" of course I said the sarist. "</seg>

<seg id="17">But I think, however, he is clever enough to keep vage enough for his statements, so that they can be interpreted in various ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of the sound for the presidential election, Mr. Trump did not even assume that, since its changeability has dropped further.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new poll of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was released on Friday, showed a lead with a large advantage over the federal states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado, and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is generally attempted to excuse his provocation, he accused his criticisms frequently to understand his testimonies or to understand his humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he strengthened in the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps's Purze have brought his loyal Mitigers into the uncomfortable situation, regardless of what provokant might like his statements.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps prominent advocates, gave great effort to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview from Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I believe what he says," "" "said Mr. Giuliani, he said to the correctness of Mr. Trumps statements, whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had established the Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in that sense that Obama was an almost unknown, small organization, he named amnists, entirely wrong, and therefore it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream republicans try to argue that the government served under Obama in which Mrs. Clinton had allowed ISIS to spread out the situation in the Middle East under control.</seg>
<seg id="26">In front of the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued to pursue its attacks on the media, and threw them before, on any of his words, and to be preoccupied against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">He inflated the "poor, twilight" TV experts who try to understand and said, "You cannot tell it!"</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the Democrats Group mocked at Mr. Trumps, merely a further evidence that he is not suitable for the presidential election.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest vertebrates is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">More rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Grönaghaia usually come to the surface in the winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to go back on board by Sanna into the sea after an investigation.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was born in 1624 and swimmers with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland failed only 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">On the ground of the North Atlantic ocean floating on the ground of the North Atlantic, it is an average of 1,220 meters in an average.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it comes down, the five-metre-long animal accelerates to satte 2.6 km / h - and with this top speed it is half as fast as a seal.</seg>
<seg id="9">This way of loneliness lifestyle seems to be a sponsoring concept for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reports in the professional journal "Science" at any time by a Greenland, the 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," commented Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for demographic Research in Rostock this life span which means for vertebrates a world record.</seg>
<seg id="12">The evolution of the evolutionary astronomer already suspected that Greenland.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only lack the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland's Greenland are difficult to observe, eventually they live primarily in the ice-sea before the inferrous coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because it is water-temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they dive in the surface usually only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers do not know about the lifestyle of Greenland's lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her timescort limbs limbs it, when they took six animals with one transmitter in front of Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, these sharks still do: in the stomach of a beast, researchers found the remains of a Robbe, another one had swallowed the pans of a young cone.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly, they hunt the sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice-sea and seek carcass, which are from higher water shifts to the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues investigated 28 Grönaghaia, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Svalbard as a stub out of the depths of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 cm long, while the largest 502 centimetre found.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of animals, they analyzed the lens of sharks with the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of eyeblens exists before the birth of Haie, which contained therein are not renewed later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had a lot of carbon-14 in the lens core.</seg>
<seg id="25">Therefore, after the early 1960s, their birth should lie down as nuclear weapons tests of large quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the length of 220 cm of the third smallest animal, the lens-core contained a low surplus of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons, it is likely to celebrate its 50th birthday in its investigation in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All the larger ones of Greenland had normal carbon-14 quantities, which is produced by cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 clock was seen for a 493 centimeter-long Greenland, which should even be 392 years old while the record-shark with 502 centimeters is likely to be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland-female becomes flat-growing only when they are longer than four metres, it was well known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were assigned to the length.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters is probably at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age at 156 years was determined, Grönaghaia is apparent at least one and a half centuries of time.</seg>
<seg id="32">That is likely to be world record for vertebrates currently.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusal is mainly living in ice waters, is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">The previous record holder, an 211-year-old Greenland, whose bacon, on the neck, was caught on a 120 year old harpoon head, was caught on Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">At low temperatures, the organism also runs on asparagus.</seg>
<seg id="36">They're waiting later - and altern slow down.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals often become particularly large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume is growing faster than its surface due to the animal heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "a smaller animal lives so more dangerous and should focus on what as soon as possible, as soon as possible, as soon as possible," "" "the evolution of evolution" "" "says" "" "the evolution of evolution" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="9">The two flattens had wrong and they are also wrong with Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">There is always obstacles to cease, but Heathrow answered every question.</seg>
<seg id="11">As the Olympic Games is Heathrow for many and not for individual infrastructure project.</seg>
<seg id="12">The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion at witty growth and a legacy of skills and employment in order to leave the airport as well as in the UK.</seg>
<seg id="13">We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion in infrastructure investment programme in time and budget, from the T5 - the five years in succession to the world's best airport terminal, up to T2, which was built in the middle of the two most frequented mileage of the world.</seg>
<seg id="14">Now they are ready to deliver a third running drive, which is supported by £16 billion to private investment.</seg>
<seg id="15">The London Games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the extension of Heathrow is also one of them.</seg>

<seg id="8">The planet probably proved more dry regions than Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to store life and protected from faster evaporation.</seg>

<seg id="3">The new data help the astronomers understand why stars can rotate within the star cluster as well as in what respect the rotational spaces with the formation of the planet.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that through the same of our results with other star clusters, more about the relationship between the mass of a star, his age and even the history of his solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>

<seg id="6">Many stars in this star cluster created around 125 million years ago, reach adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="7">They now turn right now.</seg>
<seg id="8">At peak rotational rates, these expire stars are cast large amounts of star winds.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since this winds drive through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a slightest effect on the stars.</seg>
<seg id="10">When a star is aged, its rotational rate begins to slow down.</seg>

<seg id="19">Several hospitals have already been threatened by attacks in Germany, whose patients can be threatened by the loss of naculture.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we say always to the victims" "" "Is it not paying, you only promotes the problem" "" "says Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies that are paying, their data will be back.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers, it is difficult to relieve the demand of perpetrators in the company in view of a standstill level.</seg>
<seg id="23">Hackers again know that and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the F-Secure safety forger have examined and come in contact with the press and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain their victims to chat as they can pay by Bitcoin, freely accessible support sites, or decrypt for free example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And, individuals will be redeemed by payments of a few hundred billion euros, companies must pay part hard to negotiate and five-digit sums to receive their data.</seg>
<seg id="27">Given the potential high and relatively risky profits from the Ransomware purification, the hacker are always professional and share the work, explained security professionals Chester Wisniewski from the Internet provider SOPHOS: "a single person can write a Ransomware about within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">It is likely to be more likely that it is three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their damage software then in the form of a software modular to the actual erpresser.</seg>
<seg id="30">The existing malware kits developed by malware, consulting and additional tools for one-time, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "the scope of delivery includes a adjustment tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski. "" "</seg>
<seg id="32">The expresses are looking for a further hacker to spread the newly purchased software under the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in service industry.</seg>
<seg id="34">So, in one of the forums in the underground, the set of a criminals buys a further order to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made at an independent calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"typically, the criminals apply spammer with the spread," Wisniewski explains.</seg>
<seg id="37">Meanwhile, the risk of Ransomware is now known by many companies that provide their data better.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of companies IT managers in the Malwarebie survey will trust that Ransomware by file back-ups and scannerSoftware can rely on it.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators were pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if the encryption of data alone does not have sufficient threat to successful replacement parts, the perpetrators instead, with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or prize calendar," "" "says Malwarebytes-Chef Marcin Kleczynski" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="41">Thus, the damage potential of data is still more times higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">The perpetrators could even take new goals on the internet of things in the future.</seg>
<seg id="43">On the hackerconference Defcon demonstrated security forger, how to get it with the connected thermostat under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter, the hernia of a derart blockaded heating could be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">When the perpetrators then block the entire production street in a factory instead of the heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a theme in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="3">In the small HR-V, Honda will pack all unpacking: a little SUV, a little coupe and even the versatility of a minivans.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sounds pretty overload, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, has actually been extremely flexible in everyday life as an extremely flexible.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although only 1.60 m high HR-V is rather small, passengers both have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the Frankfort.</seg>

<seg id="9">This is less magically, as it sounds: the seat areas of the rear bench can be lifted like Kinosessel and offer the storage space, which is up to 1,24 m high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="10">The boot is well loaded, but the load height with 650 mm is slightly higher than in the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening you turn around forever, at night there is time for hours in the morning, in the morning it is not enough to think of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">It's all other than relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is associated with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adult sleep disturbances and more than ten percent can be used to sleep or lasting longer than not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How can sleep problems or sleep problems?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disturbances, and it can be destroyed many causes, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the German Society for Sleffing and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, what is undergoing on it, however, the Insomnia is never fere, thus an inlet and flow.</seg>
<seg id="8">Just the piercing, many people as harmless or inadequate, Jens Wagenknecht says Jens Wagenkircht, member of the German Hausmedical association with practice in Lower Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="9">What's behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">It can be organic, mental or behaviourable factors, but also simply plugged medications.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rare is the bothering disorder of another condition.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early awakening is often occurring with a depression," "" "says Weeß." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it may be that various factors require each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">Those who has a herniated disc can be poorly awakes, wake up every two to three hours and begins to greet more than everyday problems and care to greet, there is an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">From when should I contact the doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who sleep over a period of one month in at least three nights per week should not sleep well and is impaired on the day should be at a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can be completely different: one can be beaten up, tired, inhatched, has difficulties with the attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical complaints such as magor or headaches.</seg>
<seg id="20">In order to alleviate the sleep disturbing, it is important to determine their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">As treatment options, amongst others behavioural changes, a cognitive behavioural therapy or other medications - traditional sleeping tablet only occurs in the case and at the most for two weeks - inquiries.</seg>
<seg id="22">Established in Germany, it is hardly underscores Prof. Ingo Fiesta, director of the interdisciplinary medicine at the Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">That is why, in case of sleep problems, you should turn to the homestologist, Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="24">The problems may clarify whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should put into sleep laboratory, and what happens there?</seg>
<seg id="26">For the examination in the sleep laboratory, medical advice, for example, with respiratory agility, in case of illness, or if you do not find the cause of a sleeping troubleshooting, explains Fiesta.</seg>
<seg id="27">We do not need to prepare for this examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only do not make any lunchings," says Fiesta.</seg>
<seg id="30">After being shortened to its normal time, you'll go to bed.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to the electrodes on the body you can connect one nose, a chest strap and a antennae on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera is also drawn on the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can I get the problems in the handle?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite many locking screws where you can set for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Weeß counts on: regular sleep and rise times, not too long in bed, not sleep on the day, not watching television to sleep, alcohol depart, and at night not at the clock - then it begins to charge instantly, and that's all and not eligible.</seg>

<seg id="1">Altbuilded, a few linden baths, in between still a rest headstone pavement: the Rigaer Street in Berlin-Friedrichshain works on the first look, but the police is one of the dangerous places in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">Go along the street from east to west, one is passing playing places, a refreshed kindergarten and a bikers over.</seg>
<seg id="3">On the facade of a grey house someone has ugly! "sprayed."</seg>
<seg id="4">Opposite of a Lidl, which will soon be demolished, it will already be built: by 2017 there is a house with high windows and 133 new apartments.</seg>
<seg id="5">Article about this "trendy district," like the competent property company Friedrichshain, will be preferred in the last weeks however with burning cars.</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the inhabitants of rent, on the ground floor there are still spaces occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, in particular, the Berlin interior of Berlin had several occasions for a tough approach to the project, the area referred to as a "no-go zone" for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">On 22 June the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, had been evacuated three weeks from official statements, according to 30 to 40 civil servants and three team cars on site, locked up parts of the street and stayed visitors to enter the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, renovated construction workers on behalf of the unknown house owner the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin administration decided that the clearance had been illegal, and a day later, police and workers passed under the Jubel of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon, the street is peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the brush set before the houses in the sun, others keep going diäti.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the skin projects there are primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left hand is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in the "Kiez" since 1999, and Jana *, who has been here three children, are mainly generated by police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the hood, they share the care in front of increasing counters and genetic diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="15">It doesn't sound after a Kiez, who wish to wished the majority of police in a vandalizing left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The trench, den of the Berlin interior and the police between shelters and their neighbors, obviously not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the East Berlin was actually a traditional labor quarter that also today has a lower average of poverty in comparison to the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="18">The number of residential projects also belong to the "" "" Kiez "" "": in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including nearly the whole Main road quite close to the Rigaer. "" "</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Main police had been cleared under great police forces, many of the projects were legalized in the Rigid and are still inhabited by people who had occupied them 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the district has become increasingly become the magnets of all over the world in recent years: with them, residents of GDR times and former house occupied their Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also noticeable during the rental period, which has risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newbuildings in the Rigs are being attacked as symbols for these developments: one recognizes them in raised discs or freshly knitted facades which were subjected to paints.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other street was mentioned as often along with the words "left-autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">A reason for this, that not all neighbours must be considered a problem, that they are not necessarily affected by the crime. according to offence, statistics are almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The largest part of criminal offences make the damage of atomic facts, who tend to meet the newly built and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives for 17 years in a rental house next to the controversial 94, cannot be talking about uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">There is a violent man: the people in the 94 are their neighbors who have not been determined.</seg>
<seg id="28">Also the famous burning cars will give it directly to the Riga already longer.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architectin, her street is not a criminal firing, on the contrary: "here you can get one another, along the road and get more each other than what else."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is deliberately drawn into the Riga street - and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">This is why it was so important that the inhabitants of the city will return to their streets: from the police, politics and the media, which has suddenly taken the interpretation of the city in July.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents such as Neugebauer, the street will continue to be taken away: through healthless new buildings in former buildings that twisted the ancient inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "so are the condominiums, which are not interesting for many people - there are more people living here, who are not so good things," "" "says she." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"violence and Destruction can I not guillate."</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should one do if you never listen to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">It places frustration among all sides, even with the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">For mapping that annoyed over colour bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer becomes little understanding: the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the "Kiez."</seg>
<seg id="38">Who attracts, should be aware of - just like someone who draws to a Kneipense area, can be easily complained about noise.</seg>
<seg id="39">All persons only presented with prenames are asked to be called not to be called by their right name</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is a new refugee community</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact partner in terms of integration and organisator.</seg>
<seg id="3">In addition she is a social worker.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuschle is the refugee camp for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogy supports the team of administration around Achim Grows.</seg>
<seg id="6">It sees itself as a contact partner for all actors: refugees, workers, refugee assistance, administration, authorities, and who else is not included.</seg>
<seg id="7">REGINE client of the employer indicates that the volunteer are thankful to be thankful, that Deuschle is now, the insane wok plants, which has a problem in particular.</seg>
<seg id="8">So some - less mocked as a rather rewarding to the multitude of problems - meant as the administration wanted to rewrite the place.</seg>
<seg id="9">We sought an administration of administrative with a talent for tongues and people, connected with a long-year experience in the field of social work, but a heavy wok plants.</seg>
<seg id="10">Yet administration is not its central area, Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organization, working with the people on site and also behind the scenes and network activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been in existence for around six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50-percent spot on three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "says Regine Client that Annika Deuschle Ehror and Security" "" "was supported." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and small problems, organizational, human and communication problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon there are new containers in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">There has been a great problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting ploughs that have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipal authorities are responsible for the connection output.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must accommodate refugees in their own or rented rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The cost of construction, the rent or renovations of these accommodation must bear the municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility goes from the Landratory, municipality and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not each owner wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search have been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto is not able to manage private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">It did not work yet to be confused to private apartments, as Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, new homes must be notorious, as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new container will be installed in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a fixed lead, internships, training places, one-euro jobs and staff activities for refugees and migrants who need to be frozen or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the farm or assist household, do-in-profit work - and the motivated and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">It hopes that the work of the community leads to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">That is "no employment treatment."</seg>
<seg id="35">Activity doesn't mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day require a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">Human beings would have to develop an increase.</seg>
<seg id="38">So there are offers like sport, contacts with locals and especially Spanish courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rar.</seg>
<seg id="40">So you can also skip here administration and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome in Germany and welcome.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They have to explain the refugees that it will take and allow them to be able to reach the time, for example, with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Those who like the feeling he could help in Urbach, he could not work in Urbach, do not work, and be unprofitable who will never be incorporate.</seg>
<seg id="45">The distinct majority are motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">Problem cases, however, will be honest, "people, with whom even nothing goes." the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is quite a "Mammuttask."</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: did both fear the recent incidents in front of radicalization, also in a small municipality like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "no," "" "says Regine client quite clearly," "" "what lack of naiv" "". "a risk can I could not exclude it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">Sensican be the helpers already.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents have also been subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They had the fear that the assassination attempt to call them completely in order.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do" "" "says Regine Client." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would gladly stay in urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">Thus main and honour must be paid on site and in the region according to activities.</seg>
<seg id="56">In the background they always have a new stores to refugees and migrants to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question, the policy is known.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to put them helpers on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we are not there where we would like," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">REGINE customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher already fully utilized that human beings are reasonably reasonable.</seg>
<seg id="63">There are currently around 100 people, mostly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, one must help them, both women are inig.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there is no simple answers.</seg>
