Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to address the implementation of international agreement and in@@ flow of dest@@ abil@@ ising measures in the Middle East .
but at the meeting , there is also a conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ states solution .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been un@@ e@@ ager@@ ly awa@@ ited for years .
Washington is critic@@ ised the continuous sett@@ ling of Israel and raises Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s com@@ promising will in the peace process .
through the deal worth Obama , in order to wor@@ sen@@ ed the Iranian nuclear programme , the relationship of the two further deterior@@ ates .
in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu declared an invitation to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans to the US Congress a controversi@@ al speech which has been weighted with Obama .
the speech was not spoken to Obama , a meeting having rejected this with regard to the election of the upcoming election in Israel .
in an emergency call he stands , his gir@@ l@@ friend got shot dead
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon Lamb with a somewhat tri@@ cky voice of the police , that he had shot his gir@@ l@@ friend and that the officials would have to come to his house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he was important to emphas@@ ize that his &quot; swe@@ eter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but still alive and probably said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the officials found the dead of A@@ my Pr@@ ent@@ iss and a handwritten note that was critic@@ ised for a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I loved A@@ my and she &apos;s the only woman who ever loved . &quot; this was signed by the authorities in the letter and he was signed from Lamb .
there was no evidence that he who had traveled to two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school premises , where , according to the police , he had killed a popular story professor , E@@ than Schmidt , on the door to his office and killed .
Delta State University Poli@@ gn@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that University staff heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that he did the fatal form @-@ call before him .
until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took the life when the police captured him .
one day after shooting at shooting in the university , students and do@@ z@@ ers forced them to hide themselves behind closed doors , try the authorities to make a picture of it , what Lamb is motiv@@ ated .
the details released by the investig@@ ators to the two ends of the state , just as did what students and staff who knew him , helped us to draw a picture of a talented , but may possibly difficult instru@@ ctors .
students told that they rejoiced in his instruction .
the police in G@@ auti@@ er , where Pr@@ un@@ iss died , said he has no history of violence or a criminal appearance .
he mentioned himself in one of his written book , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; which he shared his academic life .
both worked in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose teachers are 17 members , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time there were some in@@ clin@@ ations to problem@@ atic behavi@@ ors .
a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ agle , the Lamb lob@@ s , &quot; he seemed to be a little nerv@@ ous and nerv@@ ous , &quot; as if something is wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mi@@ kel Sy@@ kes , said he told him that he told him at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 with stress .
finally , before he had asked the Delta State University in order to reply to health reasons , he said that he had any health problem .
he only taught two online courses that year .
the latest changes in employment policy of the university meant that the doctorate , for the Lamb that had so hard worked , had no guarantee for an automatic way to an employment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he knows nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something like Mr Lam@@ bs presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions , the Lamb can &apos;t answer any more .
after the escape from the campus the police found later Lam@@ br@@ Ã¼ck , when he was back in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi in Ar@@ kan@@ sas .
before he was arrested , self @-@ treated himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about one mile south of his parents on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , Washington County , Cor@@ scho@@ el Johnson .
his car ran still in the drive .
it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said that she knew he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew out in the area .
since 2009 the Lamb started working at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with around 12,000 inhabitants and taught par@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he completed his doctorate in spring in education .
one of the many years @-@ long gen@@ bs were known as intelligent , char@@ ism@@ atic and fun .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said that she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met with joint friends .
they and their friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who had tried some years to get the guitar game .
he was then the black women .
all the girls has melted down when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson city of Bran@@ don .
Lamb and Pr@@ ent@@ iss were obviously some time together .
in the emergency call , &quot; I had killed my wife , &quot; but there was no charter from a marriage .
they had a dog named Light@@ ning which lived with them in the brick house that is connected to a Ba@@ you at G@@ auti@@ er .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex husband of Pr@@ ent@@ iss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were trained 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed at the bottom , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he had never met him , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he had heard that I was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ ent@@ iss , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail competed in the summer three years ago .
later they played together the one or another gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , his daughter writes and sings their own music .
Pr@@ ent@@ iss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ keeper and sometimes entert@@ aining coordinator at The Jul@@ ep Room , a weak lit bar near G@@ auti@@ er , said that he had the Lamb and Pr@@ ent@@ iss Night in the night 5 . September for the last time after I finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica record before a sp@@ ens@@ able audience .
there was no evidence that anything was not equal .
&quot; just a happy pair , &quot; he said .
we were in the appet@@ ite and cher@@ ished .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ est@@ ing .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first @-@ semester seminar programme and specialized in American u@@ cle@@ ann@@ ess and colonial history , Don Allan Mitchell , a English teacher at school .
he was married with three small children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in Kansas and was President of his Brotherhood and student &apos;s Committee .
on Tuesday evening about 900 people took part in the Cleveland State Campus in Cleveland , including do@@ z@@ ents , employees , students and members of the community at a candle light .
Sch@@ mid@@ t &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt was also part of the memorial , while the &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Amaz@@ ing Grace &quot; sang .
the Cl@@ ass@@ room is resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; said La@@ for@@ ge .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Rog@@ el@@ io Soli@@ s reported from Cleveland , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
Associated Press releases Emil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story was corrected to reflect that the police said that he had shot the emergency , after he had shot dead in his emergency call , and that he called his wife , but there is no evidence there@@ with that the two had ever been married .

Michael J. Fox ow@@ es about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a professor for Michael J. Fox .
it was also notable for personal reasons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we at the theater wait for the roy@@ als , and I know that the seat is adjacent to me , and it becomes quite clear to me that Princess Diana is next to me &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said in a trailer for a forth@@ coming documentary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back in Time &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

UN Secretary says , There is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General B@@ an Ki @-@ moon tells his response to Russia &apos;s reinforced military support of Syria : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the conflict that was held for almost five years , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen for millions of people .
the UN Secretary General calls upon all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to un@@ ite and support integ@@ rative negotiations on the Fin@@ ding of a political solution .
B@@ an told a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to discuss the foreign minister of the five permanent member states of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the outskirts of the meeting of the General Assembly of the General Assembly in this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the positions in Council and of the Syrian People and the Regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation dis@@ sol@@ uble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to present the five constant members in Syria , in which the crisis in Syria agreed to demonstrate the same solidarity and unity , which they have proven to achieve a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 Sur@@ ro@@ id values that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as the flop .
others have put it as a joke .
and some wait for the collapse .
but no matter how some Rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to move Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper push in poll@@ s down , it didn &apos;t work yet .
ten of the last eleven national surveys show Donald Tr@@ ump in a double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means the chances of nom@@ ination of the real estate business .
of course it is too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump will probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts wor@@ kes that this time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys received a guided tour leading to the rising leadership of Herman Cain , not just a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ fit groups such as J@@ eb Bus@@ h@@ s Super P@@ AC and the conservative Wirtschafts@@ akademie Club for Growth now recognize Tr@@ um@@ ps stamina and start to flow their dollar , to overthrow him .
here are some current circumstances that suggest that the real estate business Mog@@ ul is not only a temporary phase :
tr@@ um@@ ps of popularity characteristics have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced its candi@@ dat@@ ure in mid @-@ June , a survey of the Mon@@ mouth @-@ University revealed that only two of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans saw the real estate business .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
roughly three of ten say that they have negative opinion .
and these numbers hold in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa has found last week that 60 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good opinion of tr@@ ump .
two thirds of the GO@@ P @-@ elec@@ tors GO@@ P would be happy with st@@ ump as candidate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week 67 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans would be &quot; excited &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Tr@@ ump were nominated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two of 10 say they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; off@@ ended , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he was the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son manages to say the same enthusiasm as a tr@@ ump ( 43 per cent , they would be &quot; excited &quot; vs. 40 per cent , who say the same about Tr@@ ump ) .
the next thing in enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say that they were &quot; un@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; were off@@ ended , &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the greatest of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans can not see as a problem as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is already critic@@ ised for its bombs and syn@@ thes@@ ize statements , 52 percent of people rep@@ ublic@@ ans the U.S. rep@@ ublic@@ ans to have the right tuning unit for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is true in the first Romanian state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Republi@@ can think that he has promoted the personality of a Supreme Commander , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
however , 44 percent think that he didn &apos;t have the personality to effectively carry out his ministry and almost six out of 10 un@@ related warning , that his temper@@ ament is not into the White House , ABC / post .
republi@@ can Cho@@ ose get used to the idea .
when they set up their lust , Republi@@ can elec@@ tors tr@@ ump for real .
when asked if they are asked to win the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , they say four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet after a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C .
this is a change from the time when four of ten had sat down at J@@ eb Bush , from ten to the end of July .
complete dis@@ closure : GO@@ P @-@ voters had not the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this point in the last cycle , four of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans thought that Rick Perry would win the nom@@ ination opposite just 28 % for the final candidates of Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , it shows that a variety of GO@@ P @-@ elec@@ um@@ ps Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign will be considered pl@@ au@@ sible .
even when the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans cleared to another candidates , Tr@@ ump still strike almost everyone .
some experts predi@@ ct that the sh@@ atter@@ ed field probably contributes to Tr@@ um@@ ps leadership , while the Anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support has spread to more than a dozen of other candidates .
but a survey carried out at the Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ thet@@ ical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other republi@@ can candidates , tr@@ ump are seriously seriously .
he competed in front of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally on the edge Paul , John Kas@@ ich and Chris Christ@@ ie 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head @-@ race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who hits him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ lay the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ thet@@ ical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a large majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans says that they have made their opinion .
a new survey of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only little more than half of voters want to support tr@@ ump , they say that they will have their voices .
of course , much has happened to change that , and no one can really say , never change the mind .
46 per cent said they leave the door open to change other candidates .
nevertheless , Tr@@ um@@ ps is the strongest competition on the moment of the other side out@@ si@@ ders , neuro@@ sur@@ geon Ben Car@@ son , but elec@@ tors they say that they have formed their opinion , are twice as frequent for tr@@ ump .
six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on the subject of immig@@ ration .
since Donald Tr@@ ump was named in its elec@@ toral campaign , two months ago , immig@@ rants from Mexico &quot; rape &quot; was the immig@@ ration and move in the public dis@@ course in 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ arian expression gets rid of Tr@@ ump little His@@ p@@ ano @-@ Americans from the Republi@@ can party and will be damaged the re@@ orientation efforts .
however , after the new ABC / post pol@@ l of Monday six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say they coinci@@ de with tr@@ ump into issues of immig@@ ration .
as long as the immig@@ ration fr@@ au@@ ght in the r@@ amps , Donald Tr@@ ump is apparently very doing .
the fru@@ stration among the government accounts for new high@@ s .
on Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , roughly half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , mainly due to its out@@ sider status .
six out of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans speak in the new mon@@ day survey of ABC / post , they prefer a political out@@ sider as someone with government experiences .
and they are also angry during Washington .
a pol@@ l of Des Mo@@ ines Register / Bloom@@ berg in I@@ owa , two weeks ago , shows that three of four I@@ owa rep@@ ublic@@ ans were fru@@ stated in congress , with 54 percent &quot; un@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 per cent .
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential neighbor@@ hoods in Germany
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg there is the most expensive residential community - with view over the North Sea resort .
in the street , a square meter apartment of a cage for an average is 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros .
&quot; in Sy@@ lt , it is limited to objects of natural objects , &quot; says it in the study - therefore the high price .
a new study shows , in which special layers are one square meter , most .
of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student book in Munich are not really a bit .
unlike in Germany &apos;s top residential buildings , however , one of the price depends on a Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider angel &amp; Ful@@ ler has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square met@@ ering prices in narrow @-@ del@@ ousing heights .
there are several ten thousand euros for nothing - per square meter , well @-@ noted .
but well , who can aff@@ ord it ...
by the way : Munich is not an exception on the top here .
Champions League : Bavaria @-@ dream start thanks to MÃ¼ller and Go@@ ze
double tor@@ gu@@ ards in Pi@@ raeus : Bavaria @-@ star Thomas MÃ¼ller just has a run .
a happy hits by Thomas MÃ¼ller on the FC Bayern move the way to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at the Olympi@@ ak@@ os Pir@@ ae@@ us - then it ran .
a su@@ prem@@ acy for the Champions League @-@ season .
for his dream , the world champion Thomas MÃ¼ller and Mario Go@@ ze have a dream start into the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; in the wit@@ ch arm@@ chair by Pir@@ ae@@ us .
the team of coach P@@ EP Gu@@ ardi@@ ola has won the champion in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to the tr@@ asp@@ ing double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and sacrificed there ( 8@@ 9. ) it deser@@ ves 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth race in series is to be the first step towards the finale on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola wants to get to the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third running .
MÃ¼ller was awarded on his 28th place in the Champions League of Bavaria @-@ Gui@@ ded Home Organization for the Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ go@@ al@@ di , who would pass a Flanders of the World Cup as a flange .
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate that Bayern @-@ Captain Philipp Lah@@ m promised before the game in Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich &apos;s word .
it showed up , concentrated and committed presentation , without spar@@ ing .
pir@@ ate had gained his youngest six home games in the Royal class , including rep@@ utable clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ Ã©@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 , there were also Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
however , Bavaria , in seven European @-@ up du@@ els , came out of Greek teams , would not have to be the next sacrifice .
they had cour@@ age@@ ously , in their reve@@ aling effort but often into deeds .
the attacks were often led to the link outside of the left outside of Douglas Costa , which was rarely used against the earlier Braun@@ schwei@@ ger Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
MÃ¼ller was on the right side of good luck , when his flan@@ k beat out of the right hemisphere in the left corner .
in the 6@@ 7th minute , the World Champion gave the option 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half of one had sex Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first , as the Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ StÃ¼r@@ mer Brown used the head ball of Poland from the line ( 26 . ) .
then with direct participation , the go@@ al@@ keeper with the knee was par@@ ked ( 31.@@ 5 ) .
although the Bayern dominated her acc@@ ust@@ omed game , he was able to put his hor@@ os@@ mot@@ ions .
in Tor@@ ch &apos;s Manuel New was put down .
so , having a shot of ide@@ ye on the lan@@ tern ( 5@@ 6th ) .
yesterday , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola had to defend a neighborhood with David Al@@ aba in the centre near Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , which made it well .
Mario Go@@ ze , after mus@@ cular problems re@@ posed in the case , sat at first .
the World Cup report@@ edly gave more green light after the final training , said advis@@ er Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; he who wants to make something different from it has already been mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot;
also in the first switch Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided on him when he wrote down the King@@ sley Com@@ an for the nomin@@ ees Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ . ) .
Go@@ dd@@ ze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it all clearly , by El@@ f@@ m MÃ¼ller still a dr@@ au@@ ght .
in front of the game it was come to Kra@@ w@@ allen &apos;s stadium .
after a small group of partly stun@@ ned Bavaria fans in their audience block , the supporters of the host pir@@ ate with words and gest@@ ures prov@@ oked , the security forces seized and went against the Munich trailer against the Munich tra@@ ilers .
a herd of at least one Bavaria fan was injured in the stadium .
anyone smo@@ kes , has a higher risk to lose teeth
if anyone smo@@ kes , it is not only the lungs , but also the teeth - this is close to Potsdam &apos;s long @-@ term study .
good news : when aband@@ oning , the risk is sin@@ king rapidly .
smo@@ kers have a much higher risk to lose their teeth early .
that will come out of the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several collabor@@ ators of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smoking , the risk to lose their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to lose the 2,@@ 5- to 3.6 @-@ barrel .
scientists observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
main causes of t@@ ooth@@ paste , car@@ ies and fl@@ ashes of the gum , emphas@@ izes the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these par@@ o@@ don@@ tit@@ is , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ize the authors .
the connection between smoking and dent@@ ures therefore travel to frequent g@@ ing@@ iv@@ itis in smo@@ kers .
not be clari@@ fied in what extent qu@@ itting smoking also increased the risk of car@@ ies .
people who heard at smoking could reduce their risk in a short period of time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
it could take place over ten years until the end@@ anger@@ ed haz@@ ards could return to the level of non @-@ smoking , the first writer Thomas Dietrich von der English University Birmingham .
one must persu@@ ade people to make smoking , non @-@ smo@@ kers , explained the leader of H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking short@@ ens the lifetime . &quot;
not to smoke is good for lungs and vessels and leads to our in@@ sights , too high age .
in Germany , more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of ex@@ cre@@ denti@@ ality is affected by the DI@@ f@@ E .
earlier studies , we noted that smoking is the risk for early cut failure .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ lines the findings .

the repeated time , archaeological sites have been carried out in Cologne for the repeated time .
near the construction site for the new Rhein@@ bou@@ levard , arch@@ e@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic museum sk@@ el@@ eton and remains of historical buildings have dug up , said Museum Manager Marcus Trier on Tuesday .

EU Commission proposes in the dispute over TT@@ IP new court
the EU Commission proposed an extensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system on the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement TT@@ IP .
the controversi@@ al private de@@ ar@@ isation devices for disp@@ utes between companies and countries should therefore be replaced by a transparent system , which corresponds to significantly more traditional courts in its operation .
&quot; we want to raise a system to trust the citizens of the citizen , &quot; explained the EU Commissioner for Cec@@ ilia Hotel strÃ¶m .
the Swe@@ din continued to submit the proposal to European negoti@@ ating position with the United States as European negoti@@ ating position .
the German Government announced support .
TT@@ IP is intended to create the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
the plans to reform current arbit@@ ration procedures can be seen specifically that the EU states and the United States have selected independent judges to meet a new investment courtyard .
they are to be parts from the EU , the USA , and third countries .
the second instance is also provided for the first time .
it would allow it to collect against the judgments .
so far , the process involved have agreed among themselves on the refer@@ ee , there was no exception against their sentences .
in the discussion of recent months , it has become clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in Fair@@ ness and justice , but was no trusted .
in the long term , it wants to work according to own information on an International Investment Tribunal .
there , other disp@@ utes between Chinese companies and EU states could be clari@@ fied there as well .
most notably , the investor &apos;s solvency procedure ( IS@@ DS ) shall apply as one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TT@@ IP .

Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the prime minister of the Prime Minister
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns has made his election with tension from the Prime Minister &apos;s premi@@ er since its election .
the new Labour leader Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n is his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s fre@@ est@@ ing minister and met David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n is lifted up for the first of his six @-@ given questions shortly after noon , and his performance is likely to be inspected by the media and the Labour MEP from the neighbourhood .
he called for &quot; less Theater and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could ski@@ p some meetings to allow her colleagues to go on .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary exam for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns leadership , because she comes to his appointment as a member of the Shadow Cable , and following his speech at the TU@@ C annual meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the decision of the Labour leader , on Tuesday during the singing of the National An@@ them on a commemorative ceremony marking the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , prov@@ oked the criticism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MP@@ S and are at the heart of several title page stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision , not to sing the national hy@@ m@@ ne , has drawn attention to itself
&quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had worked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in respec@@ t@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he had the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ge of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Sch@@ atten@@ d@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told in the BBC Two News@@ night program , he decided to sing the Labour leader , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished .
nearly a dozen of shadow organizations have refused to serve Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , and they are called for differences in the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Parliamentary Party supported it as a leader .
the Political Cor@@ respon@@ dent to the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political dis@@ agreements are also within Labour , &quot; according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s comments on the European Union and the limit of women .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n told the TU@@ C conference that Labour changes put to be complete in order to remove the whole idea of a limitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; hours later , Mr Smith , the shadow of labour and pen@@ sions , said that the party &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is clear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is only against the government plans to reduce the limit of 26@@ ,000 Â£ to 23@@ ,000 Â£ . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n , the fifth Labour leader , David Cameron , who has been chief of T@@ ory boss in the last decade , has been across the Dis@@ patch box in the last decade .
the Labour leader , which has promised a different policies , says that he has given &quot; C@@ row@@ d sour@@ ced &quot; ideas to Mr. Cameron and has given him more than 30,000 exc@@ itation .
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the prime minister of the Prime Minister is con@@ serv@@ atively , and that he has under@@ gone down and made war with resistance and turns , to focus on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality , and challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , who will not participate in the shadow , she will not take part - for example , if Mr. Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought the idea to talk , that other colleagues are likely to take the word , and that he spoke John Ber@@ ber , the spokes@@ person of the lower house , to en@@ ig@@ ate the problem .
when he was a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he was to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le @-@ Theatre &quot; which is often linked to the minister of the Prime Minister . however , a few years later , he quit the Prime Minister .
since it was broadcast@@ ed first in 1990 on TV , the questionn@@ aire was regarded as the most important Bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his position among his parliamentary report , although critics argu@@ ed that they had become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require far @-@ reaching forms .

Peg@@ ida poster brings more Lebanese on the potato @-@ idea

inspired by the prover@@ b &quot; potato &quot; D@@ Ã¶ner &quot; on a poster of the Peg@@ ida movement , Al@@ h@@ ay potatoes and meat will be connected to a sk@@ ewer .
the idea brought him a poster with the inscription &quot; potatoes &quot; instead of D@@ Ã¶ner , which he had seen by chance on TV .
since then , in his shop , a grill sk@@ ewer , which is populated with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is multi@@ polar for the stomach , &quot; Al@@ h@@ ay .
the idea of Lebanese has meanwhile be used by the Patent Office in Munich in 1993 .

met@@ ro@@ cash kick@@ ed cash Campa@@ ign for the fight against al@@ di@@ fication
Met@@ re tries to protect the IG@@ A stores in front of an Al@@ di @-@ march to South Australia and Western Australia .
whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers @-@ whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers has started a base @-@ language campaign to defend the market share of IG@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance with a $ 700 million Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepar@@ es the opening of two sales centres and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia in the beginning of next year , Met@@ re and IG@@ A @-@ supermarkets will strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and expand the brand IG@@ A through the mainst@@ re@@ am marketing and marketing about social media , as well as events like Adelaide .
IG@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as E@@ ish@@ ec@@ Simm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes and distri@@ butions in IG@@ A @-@ stores , the cheapest tickets for the South Australian soccer league will sell to faithful customers .
it is expected that Met@@ re @-@ cash Details of his defense strategy will be released on September 29 if the whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers of food , alcohol and devices will perform an annual Invest@@ ors &apos; Day .
it is much on the play , as South Australia and Western Australia comprise almost 30 percent of met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A stores and higher profit mar@@ gins than met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in the eastern countries .
proc@@ urement in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ep@@ tional provincial and IG@@ A retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to roughly 14 percent in eastern countries .
however , anal@@ ysts predi@@ ct how Morgan Stanley is that Al@@ di twelve months after opening its first markets , roughly five percent of the food market in these two states will take away , but mainly the existing retailers can take away sales .
according to a report published in this week , analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stanley told that IG@@ A retailers can lose $ 360 million in turnover per year and met@@ ro@@ cash to $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this predi@@ ction is based on the assum@@ ption that Al@@ di opened 25 stores in SA and 30 stores over the next year and generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in the food and grocery and market for the met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high @-@ cost base could cost USD 13 million with profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ re &apos;s market share in the eastern countries , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , even though a newly conducted survey conducted by Roy Morgan had found that IG@@ A buyers are the faithful .
Morgan Stanley is participating in the food and grocery store by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2017 , and the market share of 14 percent in 2015 will reduce by 10.3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading F@@ ond@@ s@@ manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , following a business meeting in Melbourne that Met@@ ax@@ is probably will probably disappear within a decade .
Met@@ re refused to react on the comments given by Mr Dou@@ glass to the Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a member of the board of Met@@ re with Mr Dou@@ glass was able to contact Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ As market share has dropped from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trade , which has about 1,200 percent declined since 2012 , refle@@ cting the operating reduction of operating pressure on sales and mar@@ gins .
the wholesale tra@@ der is however , and invests more than 150 million dollars to make sales prices with red and vodka at hundreds of products each week , and IG@@ A retailers to improve fresh food to improve fresh food and deliver a better selection of private label food .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s chief executive director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and loading rehabilitation programs to be exchanged and hopes that the wholesale tra@@ der will return to profit for the first time in four years .
Tan@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by president of the Australian tennis ship Steve Heal@@ y
Than@@ asi Co@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deser@@ ves praise in criticism for his behaviour .
Tan@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damages &quot; in the shortest storm around his friend Nick Cy@@ cles and deser@@ ves his friend to President of the Australian tennis ship Steve Heal@@ y rather praise in criticism for his own behaviour .
co@@ ca@@ em@@ ak@@ is , the younger of talented Du@@ os , became in@@ ev@@ it@@ ated again by the not@@ orious struggle of Kyr@@ gios with St@@ an WA@@ W@@ R@@ IN@@ KA at the Montreal Masters at the lim@@ el@@ ight .
in a fe@@ as@@ ible qualification game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon afterwards , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent had to be separated with the arbit@@ rator , with Har@@ rison had said , &quot; WA@@ W@@ R@@ IN@@ KA had to beat , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was last seen , as he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket for a potential US Open @-@ win by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by Heal@@ y Respon@@ se .
the teen@@ ager is currently at Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth in second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi@@ finals against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I think about myself is the fact that after my view Than@@ asi was a little bit in the dispute &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Heal@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a bat than he lost because of a cr@@ amp in the US Open but he is not the first player who has broken a ra@@ cket of fru@@ stration among themselves , and I know Than@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , it was extremely well in the US Open , even under the pretty pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think it deser@@ ves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around itself , he has a great family around him , and I think that he was treated quite a little bit .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he &apos;s never worked with the other players , he is worked hard in shape , he is well thought , he is well in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he earns it to be judged according to his own services .
Heal@@ y also supported the decision , Cy@@ gios works on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right to all , but he as@@ sures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return to the team from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term permanent part to the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not on all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gios &#93; , &quot; said Heal@@ y .
and I think that Nick has pointed out very quickly the asc@@ ension to what people as Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray lives lost , but we try to help him understand the consequences of his trade , in which he can only think about it , and it is best for the team , and it is the best for him .
European refugee crisis : Hungary states Not@@ with@@ standing , closes the border , holding refugees back
Hungary declared the not@@ ary and locked the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held out all that tried to come into the country . everything with the aim to stop the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed on the border , as hundreds of migrants re@@ acted to a war@@ fare and Serbian officials .
the people who fled before violence , for an unknown period in a country strip on the street between the two fac@@ et@@ ings of the countries , settled down and settled there .
but fru@@ str@@ ations rose .
when a police raid over them swe@@ pt through them , the migrants &quot; opened the border ! &quot; and the damages are out against the Hungarian sen@@ ses .
some showed signs of protest food and water .
Serbia &apos;s foreign minister said it was &quot; un@@ acceptable &quot; that migrants were sent back to Hungary during more and more from Macedonia and Greece .
( Serbia ) will be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
it will have to take place in the coming days with Brussels and other countries , &quot; said Iv@@ ica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague .
the tur@@ mo@@ il of the Hungarian Serbian border came to a day after the 28 @-@ Nations block at a str@@ ingent meeting in Brussels to agree joint conven@@ tions .
however , the ministers agreed to condemn the responsibility for 40,000 people who would have fled Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the next month or until the end of the year had an agreement reached that the EU states would receive another 120,000 refugees , including some of Hungary .
on Tuesday , German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special agreement in the European Union to discuss the immig@@ rant crisis of the continent .
in Hungary , Hungary , however , settled his hopes for a bal@@ lot of action from Brussels or his neighbour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were more powers in two southern regions in the southern regions to handle the crisis , so that they could accelerate roads and asylum procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Hungarian foreign minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ ar@@ ar@@ ah said that his country also plans to build a por@@ cup@@ ine wire along his border to Romania , to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after it has ended a fence at the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News Cor@@ respon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that a prison in@@ mates were used to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months , Hungary has become a large number of war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East into a substantial bott@@ len@@ eck and the entry point into the European Union .
Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban already insi@@ sted that most import@@ ing economic refugees who are in search of a better life , and non @-@ war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , among them Germany .
the new laws , which stood at midnight in Hungary in order to cross the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high gate , which caused the government along the southern border to Serbia , to commit to a crime . these laws also constitute a higher liability for the human rights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by the mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the emergency status , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; government spokes@@ man Z@@ olt@@ an K@@ ov@@ acs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Z@@ olt@@ acs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the parliament is still to agree on the use of the military , which is expected for the next week , but re@@ por@@ ters of Associated Press had already seen an armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , Country Security Consult@@ ant for Or@@ ban , said that authorities knew 45 people attemp@@ ting to cross the border , 15 others were already lower into the country .
they come by , dis@@ embar@@ king the fence , they are now in custody , and will be charged with criminal off@@ ences according to the new laws .
authorities are doing so quick to repair the fence .
Hungarian officials were also two of the seven border crossing with Serbia , after a train car with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos led the main border crossing near Brussels , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians joined a small office in a metal container to edit the data of people and pressed a lot of human dig@@ s to cast themselves there .
some 20 managed to enter , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants who block the most important highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would like to refuse food and water until they are travelling into Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clinton flew to Ber@@ nie S@@ anders into a national pol@@ l
the former US State Hill@@ ary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit margin in the democratic race at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her opposite to the ground .
Clinton had the support of 47 percent of the democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent earlier ) , while S@@ anders are in second position , with 27 percent ( rise by 17 percent ) .
Vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced his presidential candidate , receives EU support of 15 percent of democratic voters .
more than five months before the beginning of the Presi@@ dential elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is determined to support the candidate .
but Clin@@ ton Supp@@ orters are independent in their election , than one of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News survey Clinton had lost some winning projects in a series of demo@@ graphic groups .
Clinton holds a great advantage in women and moder@@ ates , but they have reduced these jumps .
their support in men has fallen significantly , and S@@ anders are only returned with 5 points .
Clin@@ ton Adv@@ ance at democratic elec@@ tors under 50 years has de@@ vol@@ ved , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level .
Clinton had a great advantage over the older voters .
last month , Clinton appeared before S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit margin from the Liber@@ als but S@@ anders therefore has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic voters call on the country &apos;s elections that they would support with enthusiasm , if they were nominated by the party .
one quarter would support them with some conc@@ essions and another 15 percent would only support them because it is the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
perhaps it is not surprising that Clin@@ ique recent Supp@@ orters are particularly impressed with her .
the views are stronger than those who currently not support Clinton - only about one quarter would delight them .
while 48 percent of the democratic voters call the elec@@ to@@ b , Clinton had to support fewer republi@@ can voters using Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 per cent ) .
if Clin@@ ards Supp@@ orters receive in an open question , why they want the fact that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the opinion that it is time that one woman is the president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
in Clinton , Clinton had also been associated with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent for dealing with problems and voters will also be cited .
since the Vice President has a potential for the presidential hop@@ ing , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third one believes it would not do it .
if democratic voters call for the party , those who would be their second choice for the party is Bi@@ den at the top .
from Clin@@ ton supporters say more than half that bi@@ ds would be a second choice shortly before S@@ anders .
if bi@@ den decides , not for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton flew to S@@ anders , from 20 points with biograph@@ ies in the race at 30 points without him in the race .
in favor of five @-@ fifty percent of democratic voters , Clinton had seen the election in favor with the best chances to win the election ; however , this figure has fallen by 78 per cent last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den has a second at this measurement , but the percentage that sees him as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; selectable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have increased . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , with the question that is more important in a Candi@@ date , Democratic voters call on the voters .
similarly as in the last month , the only demo@@ c@@ ese candidate or potential candidate for this elec@@ torate is known as in@@ acceptable .
the Democratic candidate , or potential candidates yield good results in some important characteristics of voters of the party .
maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as hon@@ est and tru@@ st@@ worthy and with strong guide quality .
Bi@@ den cuts best with the three candidates at best when Clin@@ ton Economy is increasing the lead .
thirty per cent of the democratic voters think not that Clinton had a hon@@ est and tru@@ st@@ worthy , twice as many say that over S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion about him .
Democratic voters of the Pre @-@ Ele@@ ctions in general also Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ological in accordance with their views .
with all this measurements , roughly a quarter of democratic voters does not have any opinion of S@@ anders .
as questions concerning Hill@@ ary Clinton had to use a personal e @-@ mail address and server during the term as Foreign Minister , most of the Democratic voters were satisfied with the question of the issue and say that it did not affect their opinions .
but it is a different story in the American public .
half of Americans are now satisfied with their declaration , while only one @-@ third is satisfied .
the public opinion about this was in March , shortly after the problem of the light came .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail contro@@ vers@@ y had no effect on their general consent of Clinton , although 36 percent said they were still wor@@ sen@@ ed .
there are mainly Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more than six of 10 that say that their views are worse by Clinton .
although Clinton flew their party as hon@@ est@@ ly and tru@@ st@@ worthy , this is still a problem for them under registered voters : only 32 percent see it as hon@@ est@@ ly and tru@@ st@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 % of those entitled voters do not hold a tru@@ st@@ worthy and tru@@ st@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of those entitled to voters think national tr@@ ump , as well as not tru@@ st@@ worthy .
Clinton and tr@@ ump , however , get good notes at leadership .
of the six tested candidates , Bi@@ den and Bush be best with hon@@ esty .
a majority does not see otherwise than hon@@ est , but as with Car@@ son many will have no opinion about it .
the error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic elec@@ tors in the procedure is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son went closer to Donald Tr@@ ump near the national road near Donald Tr@@ ump on
Ben Car@@ son is located on the latest survey by C@@ BS News / New York Times dense behind Donald Tr@@ ump
on the two candidates , half of the support of voters in the new survey , and others lose their fall dramatically .
Republi@@ can voters fail to support tr@@ ump in large numbers . the support grows by 23 % in the last C@@ BS undertaken , which was conducted before Fox News debate last month , by 27 % on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son kick@@ ed off at the same time from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son deals well in demo@@ graphic groups and sur@@ passes tr@@ ump in Republi@@ can elec@@ tors .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Govern@@ or John Kas@@ ich , is beaten with Wis@@ con@@ sins governor Scott Walker , who is on the lowest , namely 10 % support within the last month to now 2 % .
the former FL @-@ Govern@@ or J@@ eb Bush , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ sas , Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are located at 6 % on the third place .
the code of error in the sample of 376 people of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in this latest survey is Plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week , shows that Car@@ son grew up in the surveys - with 19 % support during Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post showed tr@@ ump clearly ahead of Car@@ son .
with a view over one of the last week , Tr@@ ump took some side@@ hi@@ es for the former Neuro@@ sur@@ geon , even after Car@@ son decided to ap@@ ologi@@ ze to question Tr@@ um@@ ps faith in question .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump on last Saturday during a campaign of campaigns in I@@ owa .

five members of the Brotherhood are charged with the death of a Baruch College
almost two years after a student has been handed over by a student union in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , today , M@@ ord@@ an attacks against five people will be handed in .
members of the New Yorker &apos;s Baruch College P@@ i @-@ del@@ i @-@ P@@ si @-@ bro@@ therhood can become brut@@ ally and delayed its transport into the hospital , which has contributed to his death in September 2013 .
officials said that he had been inter@@ locked with connected eyes with a 30 pound back@@ pack of sand , and repeatedly attacked while he was trying to pursue a frozen field on a destination .
Mr. Den@@ g def@@ endant about head@@ ache , then he fell un@@ conscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ del@@ i @-@ bro@@ therhood call not the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was accomplished and waited a hour before they brought him into a hospital , so the police .
they had time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing to state his symptoms and Andy Men@@ g , to contact the national President of the Brotherhood to join Council , said Poli@@ gn@@ ef Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; at this point the members began to hide U@@ ten@@ sil@@ ia and introduced the good care of the Brotherhood , basically the by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Poli@@ gn@@ ef Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died in the next morning to his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g repeated with dum@@ my strength injuries in head , tor@@ so and upper th@@ igh .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least a student has been working every year since 1970 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , who de@@ fies the D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
religious bro@@ th@@ erh@@ oods and their members have to be held responsible , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended a charge concerning Mor@@ ning third Gra@@ des for the first five members .
two and thirty members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with sch@@ ik@@ ane attacks and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; we do not only want to do only the participating persons responsible , but if there is an organization that has officially declared - officially and un@@ official - that we will also draw these to the account , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday .
the Baruch College had forbidden the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood ple@@ dges its affili@@ ation to the local group .
that will happen if the F@@ ed raised interest
an interest rate will come , and the domestic product will come to be refu@@ elled , yields to bonds , and the economy will lead into recession .
we know that .
what we can &apos;t know how long will it take away and how long it will stop .
in particular , the story of the economy provides a small manual for the exp@@ ir@@ ation .
a recession came within only 11 months after the first interest rate and lasted 86 months .
the aggressi@@ vity of the Federal Reserve at the lifting of interest rates is often , if not always , a factor such as the economy and financial investments are react .
therefore , representative of the US Central Bank has emphas@@ ised so fierce that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather over the period , which is needed for normal@@ ization .
in fact , several variables are playing a role .
at the end , market participants could however detect that the whole exc@@ itement was possibly ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated due to a rate hike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is mis@@ interpreted by a few than a signal to the end of the era of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian J@@ ess@@ op , Chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a Communication to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradu@@ al return of U.S. interest to normal heights , but still on a low level to the seism@@ ic shock which seem to fear many .
this does not mean that there will be no effect .
here is a look at historical trends , what some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen in the past month , the anticip@@ atory rate of interest rate for a while will take place .
once the increase is imposed , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is apparently a tendency to contra@@ di@@ ct wealth orders for 12 to 24 months after the first increase , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Deutsche Bank anal@@ ysts predi@@ ct results in a newer study what happens after interest @-@ rate hike of the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in more specific , the market is usually aged in the past 35 years - on its way to interest rate hike , fairly flat in the 250 days later ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , with an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.4 percent according to a recent analysis , which published Bob D@@ oll , CEO design@@ ator at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , in Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on shares ten@@ ds to appear later in the Incre@@ ased cycle and returns , to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest rate increases they often promote .
in the current case the F@@ ed is con@@ fron@@ ted with some conditions that could not lead before and accelerate the recession .
extremely interesting it is that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point at an interest rate hike of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , 118 percent of interest rate has been only twice the nominal GDP under 4.5 percent since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 stood at 3.6 percent , only few that will last and expect to anticip@@ ate the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed only 1.5 percent .
interest rate at a frag@@ ile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and throw the question as if it is different this time , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank .
market participants have made the whole year to an interest rate hike around the F@@ ed , and all eyes were aimed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could generate an increase in this meeting , the fut@@ ures trade is only a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study all increase cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing weak@@ ening of GDP and converted them very quickly after the start of recovery in the shade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a very slow recovery of what the worst recession observed in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest , which has maintained the F@@ ed since the end of last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these are now 74 months .
the fixed income was also vol@@ ati@@ l since the market anticip@@ ate a rate hike , and the pattern is pretty similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the impact of bonds are faster than in stock , if its strategic class change .
when bonds appear to change the head@@ ings , once the initial raise / decrease in the cycle is performed .
at the end of the increase cycle , the applicant are immediately exp@@ elled , the Deutsche Bank said .
the Strat@@ ess of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the rise in interest rates will lead that yields between longer and shorter form of bonds come closer and lead to a breakdown of the curve .
highly interest bonds often bring a better yields , even though we &apos;re still careful to expect higher income , &quot; says Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Analy@@ st in with Schw@@ ab , in an analysis .
its interesting fact is Jones that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy requirements .
&quot; beside the strength of the dollar and the decline of the inflation expectations , there are some evidence that the market has adjusted to the pro@@ spect of stric@@ ter policy , &quot; she wrote .
short @-@ term interest have increased , the yield curve is flat , lending has increased , and the volume has increased - all characteristics of the market if the F@@ ed has tigh@@ tened its strategy .
in large and entire companies , companies with un@@ winding the larger part of its business activities in the U.S. , will benefit from it , when interest rates rise and local products are attractive .
multin@@ ational enterprises are worse due to high debts , as a rising dollar caused its products on the global market , and also the financing of their debt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares are extremely positive , three months after an initial rate hike , said Gold@@ man Sachs @-@ anal@@ ysts in a report for the customer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have exceeded the level achieved by 5 percentage points after each of its interest rate in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital payments , as well as low volume rate among their shares exceeded its counter@@ parts with low quality of average 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts are a big problem .
companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose the most , said Gold@@ man .
outside the pure stock games , consumers can benefit from increasing the rising dollar .
Spar@@ er could see gains through higher income , even if experts of different opinion may be how fast this will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says parliamentary Council of Andrew B@@ ingham
in the Parliament , the conservative member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the transmitter for his &quot; stup@@ id &quot;
he argu@@ ed that he is not to distinguish increasingly from any commercial rival .
he was add@@ ressing the BBC Music Awards , and said they only quoted The Br@@ its
member of the Parliament of Dam@@ ien Collins , the show The Voice to and said that this was not a very original .
BBC Radio 3 &quot; converts up to Classic FM , asser@@ ts a leading member of the parliament and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove something that he does not do something .
the conservative MEP Andrew B@@ ingham also called to BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen , that the public @-@ legal radio broadcast &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; and has no longer to be distinguished by his commercial competitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t want to hear the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stup@@ id &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to be converted to Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he accepted also to the BBC Music Awards , which started in December last December .
the BBC Music Awards , who began last year appear to appear only under a different name .
so if you try to do something else - this is two spontan@@ e@@ ously mentioned examples , in which you are only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC Director General appointed the alleg@@ ations and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 goes far ahead of its commercial competitors , when it comes to live music and ligh@@ ten@@ ment of the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 I will learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music , which is really un@@ surpassed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment to Radio 3 , new music is to be found and new works , I think also really for important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argu@@ ed that har@@ der had to work , to eng@@ age the audience as it was this in the past because the British were informed about classical music .
radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production that fell during the hearing in the Committee on the selection of culture , media and sport for it under fire , falling to commercial rival sitting on the feet .
The T@@ ory of Dam@@ ien Collins The Voice On The Voice On - The musical Talent Show of the BBC , which was bought by the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media , for an estimated cost of Â£ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often disc@@ arded because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
LORD Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - featuring Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as judge - &quot; was produced in a special BBC technique . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added to them that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our own barn , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is the next time to start a entertainment series . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he ref@@ uses to exclu@@ de the order from the Voice of The Voice in the Future or to spend money of stir@@ r@@ ers to other consumer formats .
net sales increased in August at the slow@@ est and the Black Friday cannot be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
there was the lowest result since the start of records in 2000 .
online sales increased 3 years ago through the use of mobile phones to buy
experts believe that the Black Friday in November has slow@@ ed down spending money in November
for more than one decade , the virtual shopping is bo@@ oming , and many of the main shopping streets in Britain have turned into gh@@ ost .
but experts say that there are now signs that online sales stag@@ n@@ ating , after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August was the lowest rise in growth since the start of records in 2000 , with only five percent increase over the previous year .
experts predi@@ ct that there are signs that online sales stag@@ n@@ ating , after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you consider the growth rates for previous years until 2000 , it has always been developed over the course of time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ RG sale of the Guardian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he explained that the online sales increased by more than three years ago as buyers began to make purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now this is true , and we will see that growth is reduced .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon , which was imported from America , is quoted as a reason for the aband@@ on@@ ment revenue .
experts believe that buyers will take place in front of this event , taking place at the last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers got their computers to make their bar@@ gain , and some dealer websites are stor@@ med .
experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyers would be able to fin@@ alise the fin@@ isher , buyers of it , buyers would be able to make purchases .
a study by the British Ret@@ ail Con@@ sortium was found out that out of Â£ 5 spending money was issued online .
in some products such as television and washing machines more than one @-@ third of the purchases now have been carried out via Web @-@ shops .
at the same time more than one quarter of man clothing and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in the inner cities .

B &amp; Q Boss is said that the time of cheapest Eastern European crafts@@ men passed by
British concern more art@@ is@@ ans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of qualified crafts@@ men from Eastern Europe has a rise behind
this means that there are 200 other screens , which are target to tra@@ des@@ people on tra@@ des@@ people ,
at the same time , King@@ F@@ isher 60 B &amp; Q outlets will close ties
from Ru@@ pert Steiner , City Head @-@ Cor@@ respon@@ dent in the Daily Mail
it is claimed that Brit@@ ons are able to conduct their hammers and pain@@ t@@ brush in favour of the use of qualified young European crafts@@ men that perform the work in their home
you are sk@@ ill@@ ful to handle with a hammer or a brush for p@@ inn@@ ful of walls , you belong to a minority in nowadays .
for Britain , increasingly des@@ iring to do more crafts@@ men to do home jobs in their houses , head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
V@@ Ã©@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new managing director of King@@ F@@ isher , who owns the tre@@ mol@@ ded chain , said that is a great increase in the number of qualified crafts@@ men from Eastern Europe that offer services too low prices in the meantime .
hence , King@@ F@@ isher is planning to open 200 other screens shops that are interested in crafts@@ men and hold 60 sales outlets from B &amp; Q .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said that they would employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight of ten buy decisions in the store are taken by women .
at the moment , the men weigh the men .
it said that it is necessary to represent the growing demo@@ graphic trends that have more female single homes that make more renov@@ ations in the past .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; there is still a majority of men in our stores .
we must move it more pot@@ ence to a balance .
in principle , half of our customers in women are 80 percent of the decisions concerning the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women on the top of a British in the FT@@ BE 100 Index , has also en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed their top team to reflect the same number of men and women in man@@ ag@@ erial positions .
King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that has occupied almost 50 percent of the team with women including his management and Chief Financial Officer .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a deliber@@ ate decision - this is an important topic here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ F@@ isher reported a decline in the half @-@ year profit and the surveys , after the Group ow@@ es its costs to the closing of the shops .
because of the trends , King@@ F@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q will have to open 200 new branches .
officials of A@@ I / D@@ if because of un@@ faith@@ fulness in court
the Provin@@ cial Court of Klagenfurt took place on Wednesday two officials of the Austrian Volleyball cup A@@ I / D@@ if for un@@ faith@@ fulness and con@@ sent@@ ing education .
the def@@ endants are not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse of authority .
he was acquitted in May by force in May .
the current process was post@@ pon@@ ed .
according to the tor@@ ney @-@ At@@ tor@@ ney Robert Ri@@ ffel , he showed that the accused were taken by the United States between 2006 and 2011 , on which they were able to work spontan@@ e@@ ously for private purposes .
he estimates the damage with around 400,000 euros .
the sport func@@ tion@@ aries are also charged with financial support .
this fact was the President Micha@@ ela San@@ in , Chair@@ woman of the office of open@@ er , judge Micha@@ ela S@@ in .
it should be written at a later date .
the Defence sent the Defence resulting from that the association was not a good time to the association at no time .
the sport func@@ tion@@ aries had only been delayed and the sport club , which had been active from 1982 to 2011 and in which it had spent a lot of time and money , from the debt - the Passi@@ va lived around 600,000 euros in 2001 ( approx . 44@@ ,000 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , we stood before the situation : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the club on or locking , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; telling one of the def@@ endants in the bread of bread , the financial authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he decided to co @-@ def@@ endants with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants to take this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have put money pre @-@ shot to put our life insurance as security at the Bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said within the deposit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as agreed with the association : you can manage the money free , there must only be no debt .
it was also possible - with the corresponding financial - success to dis@@ bur@@ sed the re@@ charges in retro@@ active up to 1991 .
so , as a result of the adv@@ ent damages only years later , in 2003 , when an increase was on the account , it paid out .
therefore there are also tim@@ bre@@ l@@ - and not detailed scenarios , the former observ@@ ance of the former Ob@@ man .
the former accused , being administered by the two accused , accused the second accused .
why the pay@@ outs had not been enlarged in detail , asked the judge .
the society was not interested in detail for the financial relationship , important is only the debt of debt , so the answer .
in 2011 , an amount of 120,000 Euros was transferred to the club account for a functioning in 2011 .
they were these were the def@@ endants , the def@@ endants appeared .
this issued account ran on the name of the second accused and was not known in its statement by the association .
&quot; why ? &quot; he wanted to know the judge .
by reading the answer , I asked no answer .
then he said that he had believed that this was the best for the club .
if something happened to something , nobody would have known something of this money , the prosecutor presented in the room .
the co @-@ def@@ endants were informed and just@@ i@@ fies the function .
this transfer was formulated as &quot; damages of damages . &quot;
why damage report ? , wanted to know judge and prosecution .
it declared that the first accused was not understood with this formulation , because the association was never made serious damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what shall I do when the lawyer says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are all of you all from the Schneider &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; have I been an legal agent ? , &quot; he asked .
in addition , the function wasn &apos;t which he has never referred to a cent content , he only count o@@ dom@@ eter and di@@ ets .
in di@@ ets , he was charged to the association â¬ 1,000 per month , but the actual effort had , however , added a lot more .
exact documents for the early years were not able to present the accused .
those who have been judged by an operating examination , in which everything was evaluated as correct , they declared .
also the second accused was accused .
all of them are in cash , in which he must lead to lead people from his residence to the Bank to Ab@@ burg , in his statement .
the trial is continued on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard st@@ ills another 30.000 jobs
in addition to the start of three years of ongoing personal fin@@ ders , computer science will reduce further jobs when it expi@@ res .
the job sub@@ missions at the US computer giant H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) are not end .
during its restructuring , the U.S. technology group plans to hold a reduction of 25,000 to 30.000 jobs in its corporate customers .
as a result , the company has to be saved in the amount of EUR 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) , the company distributed on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special loading of around â¬ 2.7 billion that will be incur@@ red in the fourth quarter .
the ongoing reduction of 55@@ ,000 jobs have been ongoing since three years .
at the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 , HP employed some 30,000 employees .
the listed price of the H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard share came into 2.3 percent .

time of decision on interest rates for the US @-@ Bank bank
the world is ob@@ serving when the US @-@ mark expi@@ res in two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , in order to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest is raised or not .
a survey conducted among 80 econom@@ ists who were surveyed by Reuters took out that a little more than half , who is still last week of view , think that the F@@ ed will do this , now even th@@ inks that the F@@ ed will continue to wait for longer and interest rates on the current stand from 0 @-@ 0.25 percent .
it &apos;s a historical event because it has been seven years ago since the F@@ ed interests was set at NU@@ LL .
for the first time , we approach a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero area and starts a process of normal@@ ization of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , Head of Employ@@ ees at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the U.S. economy is at a relatively good power level , trillion dollars will be added to the balance and generate just one small inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less stunning views of a global situation .
she warned the markets to raise itself to an increase , but the evidence indicate that the opportunities are good against such a step .
the decision should be posted at 8@@ pm CET on Thursday
death of the Delta State University post@@ pon@@ ed cancellation notice
after the shooting and killing of his gir@@ l@@ friend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later shot his colleagues , he wrote a note to say that it would be sorry for him &quot; with the first murder and wanted , &quot; he could make it un@@ done , &quot; said the authorities on Tuesday .
the police in G@@ auti@@ er , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that he is a teacher for Ge@@ ography and social scientific education at the Delta State University , calling the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and he said that he was shot on someone and to put man to death .
the staff of the emergency call shows that police officers have to send police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the house , but that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody can inter@@ f@@ ere &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably it will be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the call@@ ers after his name , but he didn &apos;t make him .
Lamb has no explanation for its shots .
when police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ ent@@ iss , 41 , and a handwritten note from Lamb , 45 , saying : &quot; I &apos;m sorry for me , I wanted to rep@@ ay it .
I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
after writing the notice , he drove 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday night as polic@@ emen trained to kill him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he knows nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something like Mr Lam@@ bs presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday , the Lamb report@@ edly believed that Pr@@ un@@ iss had given a relationship with Schmidt on Tuesday , there would be no information , no evidence , no evidence for a &quot; three @-@ relationship relationship . &quot;
Pr@@ ab@@ iss was described by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said she was married for about seven years , considered a &quot; good man . &quot;
the two were di@@ vor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , he and Pr@@ ab@@ iss had a daughter who is 19 , and it was destroyed . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ ent@@ iss had her daughter , &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
Pr@@ ab@@ iss worked online from home , according to the left home of Lin@@ s@@ day Know@@ les , which was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close gir@@ l@@ friend of Pr@@ un@@ iss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ ent@@ iss had a dog named Light@@ ning that had been lying here for about three years .
&quot; it would always help others to help others , &quot; said Know@@ les
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We had called relatives to a certain point on Monday to tell them &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he doesn &apos;t go to prison &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a polic@@ emen fet@@ ched him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville in that night he drove his car to the side , fled at foot , ran in the forest and killed himself with a shot .
here , in Spring 2015 , he received a PhD in the University of the University from the Delta State University .

Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa builds the Group
the Lufthansa is planning a large group sales .
the Lufthansa Group intends to save a half billion euros in the year alone with a better organization .
the Group &apos;s workforce of about 1000 managers will cost the workplace in the world .
with the pilot @-@ term handic@@ raft the new negotiations are available .
the Lufthansa will build up its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the Billi@@ g@@ to@@ k Eu@@ row@@ ings .
the aim of real@@ ignment is the contribution to the contribution of some 500 million Euros per year from cost of cost and sol@@ uble turbines , as the airline served on Wednesday .
among other things , there is no provision for the passenger car in the future .
the Billi@@ g@@ flug@@ el@@ line Eu@@ row@@ ings should be specifically designed as in@@ compreh@@ en@@ sible as possible .
in the Executive Board of CEO Dr. Carsten Sp@@ oh@@ r will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings in the future .
with the new position , Sp@@ oh@@ r emphas@@ ises the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings with the Group to stand against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet .
to date , the organisation of the 120 000 employees was complex .
under the roof of the Al@@ line Group , the airline is a three @-@ quarter turnover of 30 billion Euros .

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can &apos;t play for a double fra@@ cture
Luke Sha@@ w was defeated in the Champions League @-@ defeat of Manchester at the PS@@ V Eindhoven , a double fra@@ cture of his right one .
while this left the left out@@ fit for the weeping and brought him for at least six months from playing , Louis van G@@ aal will not give hope that Sha@@ w can play back in this season .
the injury was caused by a guided attack by H@@ Ã©@@ ctor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was installed in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the field and required oxygen before joining the hospital .
van G@@ aal said : &quot; he has a double leg press and is situated in the hospital . &quot;
tomorrow , he will be re@@ located tomorrow or maybe one day later in Manchester .
it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes up to Manchester United , it &apos;s very hard and then it plays fantastic , and then it happens .
in the dressing room he had an oxygen layer .
he wept .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double fra@@ cture , it will take six months and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed to be happy , a red card and the hanging of a cub@@ ator .
Nic@@ ola R@@ izz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , won &apos;t get the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van G@@ aal assumed that the Italian arbit@@ rator had er@@ red .
you can decide to yourself , if I say that a mo@@ cking meter and a red card have to become due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
a twe@@ et was written : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words can not describe your messages , as broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I &apos;ll be back again . &quot;
elsewhere : Manchester United suff@@ ers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w at the defeat at PS@@ V
in France , the British Defense Minister has an additional inc@@ en@@ tive to recover from the European Championship in France until the next June .
Philli@@ p Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player leaves the space with this type of injury , all are very sad about that .
it &apos;s never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate a opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg press leaving as Mexico against Van Ga@@ as Holland team at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; he &apos;s very hard because it was not his intention to viol@@ ate the opponent , and when you hear that there is a very bad injury , that is not good , &quot; said Coc@@ u .
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball , who was moving in another direction , so it looked as if he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know as it feels like , I know how difficult it can be .
I feel very badly doing . I &apos;m sorry for that .
the PS@@ V @-@ player Andr@@ Ã©s Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to the hospital - after a oul@@ ders of Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David knows David Cameron The Lor@@ ax better ?
it &apos;s a thing to learn all of the parents : if your child loves a book , it will not last long until you know it almost .
unless , you are perhaps David Cameron .
as he was asked by a supplier of child care systems to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens , the Prime Minister of The Lor@@ ax , which appeared in 1971 , decided to see the environmental label of Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult election , writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company Super@@ camps , and continues : &quot; funny , lively , creative and with a powerful message , it is a book that I like to read my children , because it seems to have always a picture or a message which we have missed . &quot;
everything was nice and good , except the calcul@@ ator of the book describes which Cameron is supp@@ os@@ edly described the action of the book , instead gives a presentation in the movie version of 2012 , which added new characters and details to expand the fairly short text @-@ text .
&quot; in the heart of the fortified city Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature is gone and even the air is a commod@@ ity , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , to see her desire to see a real tree , has been met . a love inter@@ acting was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name Theodor Se@@ uss host@@ els , who died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if that is not suspic@@ ious enough : the text of the Lor@@ ax movie that will be presented on the website of Internet Movie Database , where everything is artificial , and even the air is a commod@@ ity , a boy called T@@ ed , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although fact , it seems un@@ likely to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems un@@ likely that Cameron triggered the action of the book as little tru@@ ant , Th@@ need stri@@ cking Once @-@ ler despite the Prot@@ ests of the nam@@ ing Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ ling , schn@@ ig@@ y beings , &quot; which is laid down in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was assigned to a hel@@ per that The Lor@@ ax has not read 20 times in a row in a row .
a Dow@@ ning Street spokes@@ person said that the text came probably from Cam@@ er@@ ons election .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text of Cam@@ er@@ on staff was delivered , but there were no other immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult .
it is a difficult task in Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , but is a difficult task , but if you want the K@@ ader to the UK for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series is not on my card .
I would not exclu@@ de a down@@ turn victory .
Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks website may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the Batt@@ ing Meeting , and the community is strong ; they will bear no sc@@ ars of 2012 , only a you@@ thful alignment .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali develops itself as spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and A@@ DI@@ L Ras@@ hid , even when it represents an un@@ familiar size on the test level , is an option for the attack .
this news @-@ related message : Adam Ly@@ th consists of the Great Britain @-@ test C@@ ader and is replaced by Alex Hal@@ es .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , very difficult to analyze .
at his seven tests there were two good attacks , under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cre@@ ck@@ et@@ ions are targeted at results .
there was no question at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nomin@@ ee , as - and I told these things - players their own top choice .
long ago would have been extended the race of Ly@@ th , but he had the control of his own dest@@ iny .
if hop@@ efully further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance will be seen .
the England Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude , even though he did not so good performance , and that surprised me not , he is especially a team @-@ guy .
the question how much time a test stroke is awarded to set his sign is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton did 9 .
only comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down@@ wards .
the only design that you can collect , that England began at first Jonathan Des@@ p@@ ite in the Caribbean - but as Ly@@ th in the Caribbean - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex Hal@@ es came in , and he is a stroke that I eng@@ age in high places .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ mp@@ et@@ ker , which saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season , when he scored 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which hit us very much .
he must have at least the same odds as they received before it , but this depends on the occupation of United Arab Emirates in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to beat the Mo@@ een next to Cook , I would bring four qu@@ icks hat@@ s over a spin , and I have nothing to control .
I do not see why a b@@ ats@@ man can &apos;t beat there and this left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a devil sk@@ er@@ l of cri@@ cket players .
Mo@@ een may not do his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , yet he is a number 3 for them , and there is no great difference .
my previous team @-@ mate Just@@ in Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before being joined as Op@@ ener in 2001 .
he immediately abolished three hundred p@@ uns and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ re as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited handling he has very impressed me as a young man .
people may see their statistics on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it is a p@@ unt , but there is no large number of backup sp@@ inner that lift up their hands and the trainer have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England made a few wise additions to the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ ed , the governor from Sri Lanka , served as an advisor for the test games could be a master &apos;s coup .
he is one of the most common guy of the game , which will bring a wealth of experience since he has played under all the terms and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood is used for the white ball stages of the Tour and brings energy and powerful use into the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international Cri@@ cket Competition as a player or as a coach , and as Mah@@ ela he has an in@@ sights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can still bring fresh air in the dressing unit , even if the messages are in line with the prior command .
coll@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , will not be used in the One @-@ Day@@ er , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem for my part .
some will not agree , but co@@ aches and team support cannot determine the schedule .
and you must remember , that , as with players , will depend on their jobs from the results .
such decisions are not made easy to heart .
Bre@@ x@@ it stock ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit of British accession from the EU ) could win ad@@ on if the economy is sl@@ ack@@ ing up until 2017
David Cam@@ er@@ ons un@@ pronounced new bar@@ gain strategy to keep Britain in the EU will come deeper into trouble with every day , even without the election of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is It Yes or No ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leaders of Labour or TU@@ C , who are violent in Europe on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
fore@@ igner also have their Cor@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ acy , as recently , some member states that are deeply split into different cr@@ ises such as the EU is now and not always from their own debt , British itself created agenda with split @-@ pal@@ ms and distur@@ bing changes , which they usually are not satisfied , are satisfied .
in Brigh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided on its annual meeting that it does not like it even if they end@@ anger@@ ed the social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie agenda .
Prime Minister and Minister of Finance climbing at summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capital cities make a photo of itself in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they win allies for re@@ forms .
it always goes around me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend who wish to remain outside the Great Britain , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let us not alone with France , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and can look through that more and more sum@@ marily minister and civil servants come to the point at which it doesn &apos;t matter whether we remain or go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany &apos;s c@@ auti@@ ous Chancellor Angela Merkel is a ally , but it has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks po@@ or@@ ly for her like the ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated long expos@@ ures like Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
French FranÃ§ois Hollande looks back on his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
he is also a promising force .
Poland may soon become a national@@ ist regime , Spain , in Spain .
it &apos;s difficult to imagine that it should be a leg w@@ rest@@ ling to prevent the Sel@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy should get better for it , Scotland &apos;s withdrawal from the UK - something that they do not want to have the most similar separ@@ at@@ ist tenden@@ cies .
therefore , perhaps some such ministers might even deliber@@ ate not helpful comments , all in the SN@@ P @-@ style , while Britain &apos;s refer@@ end@@ ums in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , believes my friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new trial was a Ple@@ ite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Britain has won nothing from the transition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how to burn the Fle@@ et Street to its cost , and which EU Sk@@ ep@@ tics is the oli@@ gar@@ ch@@ ie of the press bar@@ ons , but did not have been inspired by Tony Ben@@ n inspired them in 1975 at a ratio of 2 : 1 .
you can remember the weak of Boris Johnson , the ore Euro Opp@@ ortun@@ ities , who has made itself a name as a &quot; EU @-@ Straight ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels Cor@@ respon@@ dent in the early 90 @-@ s .
with all his conf@@ ession , Ed Mil@@ i@@ band , who were his enemies .
in addition , the Med@@ ley of the tax @-@ fÃ¼r@@ t @-@ Sch@@ ur@@ ks , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ ing foreigners and the pseud@@ o @-@ non @-@ foreigners who own most of our large newspapers .
actually Tony Bl@@ air thought about it , but presented that if you &apos;re sitting with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , one is distributed better ban@@ anas in order to give him instead of his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mil@@ i@@ band led more Bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ ans as a Bl@@ air himself , as he had surrendered to the Cam@@ er@@ ons refer@@ end@@ ums , because Bl@@ air had turned the principle concerning the non @-@ adopted Constitution of the EU , which then opened to him by French and Dutch voters in 2005 .
the press also has never missed it .
but the nice Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly fl@@ ap on the back on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he would not need more time for me - seems to repeat , Neil Kin@@ no@@ cks Bo@@ boy@@ cott Mur@@ doch at the 80 @-@ year @-@ old , an error at that time and today .
it may take it , but it must develop a coh@@ er@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa has left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position to Europe - I do it -@@ friendly - in development .
it says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional bladder tendency and wild po@@ lics by Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can well say Yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A ben@@ n , &quot; but no Ben@@ n@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n in the radio and on television this week , when the boy sc@@ outs played in him , not to ad@@ mit that Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s appointment of John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as a shadow Chancellor was a bad idea .
it remin@@ ded me of the 70 @-@ year @-@ old when his old father felt on television in spite of his turning , ag@@ loy@@ al opposite his Labour cabinet office , without going to go too far and lose his Cab@@ inet job .
Hil@@ den@@ ys &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
but to fight , in order to remain under all circumstances - Ben@@ n was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said that what J@@ C told his fellow cont@@ ention and MPs back to all reports on Monday evening .
what always wants to inter@@ rupt the touch @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n - think it even has touched me - News discipline remains important in the age of TV round the clock and especially in the structure of the social media , a breeding place of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ y@@ al .
it &apos;s right to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe that allows him to hold the Lab@@ ours support in the refer@@ en@@ ity campaign for a self est@@ ess , as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins always th@@ inks about that .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns is a basic majority of EU membership - in line with their anti @-@ capitalist debate - is no longer just a question of animal origin under left dis@@ sidents , for which the Nar@@ c@@ is@@ sm@@ us of small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic forces .
as with its launch of Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign for the withdrawal , foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find in particular a sense to their su@@ peri@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have mis@@ demanding voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British , if this will be po@@ int@@ less ?
the United States are already dis@@ appo@@ inting by the weak military service in Iraq , in Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government on power , what was rec@@ alled during the start on Monday , what British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum was mentioned .
experts critical report from public Health England over E @-@ cigarettes
claims of a state @-@ funded agency that E @-@ cigarettes is less dam@@ aging than smoking taken from a meeting of 12 people , some with connections to the tobacco industry .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ C ) proclaimed Lanc@@ et by critic@@ izing the references of public health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigarettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basic report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however some researchers have asked the load capacity of the data and referred to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
one of the editorial in the professional journal Lanc@@ et last month , the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily cast foundation , &quot; which he founded his most important conclusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two more researchers are writing to the BM@@ C and asked if the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can build &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Ep@@ idemi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the detection of effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public statement would expect that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that E @-@ cigarettes is about 95 % less dam@@ aging than smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on a detailed review of the evidence and modeling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for a multiple criteria @-@ making analysis ( Multi @-@ Crit@@ eria Decision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) in order to execute their opinions on the damage of various nic@@ ot@@ ine content of synthesis , the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting called Euro@@ Swiss Health was whose managing director was supposed to have received from British American Tob@@ acco ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BA@@ T for Public Health in a Corporate Sustainable Development Report .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting stated that funding from a E @-@ cigarettes manufacturer would receive , but not the financing , which to receive reports before the tobacco company Philip Morris International , added them .
the reasons for the member of the committee are not supplied but include several well @-@ known E @-@ cigarette , some of which also specify a sector financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the tobacco management of the P@@ he participated in the session .
the research work of the group &quot; stated that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products in most criteria , &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee &amp; Cap@@ e@@ well .
however , no such connections or restrictions are discussed in the P@@ he report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee &amp; Cap@@ e@@ well said that the claims by P@@ he that &quot; there has so far been no evidence that E @-@ cigarettes as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smoking . &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he , said that BM@@ C has already responded to the claims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ cigarettes are significantly less dam@@ aging than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ life @-@ cat@@ cher dies on his view@@ finder .
all evidence shows that the health risks of E @-@ cigarettes in comparison are small , but we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has the unique duty to report the public about what is proof of evidence and what does not , especially when there are much public confusion about the relative risks in the comparison to tobacco .
almost 80,000 people die annually at a disease with respect to smoking , and smoking cost the National Health Care System Â£ two billion per year .
by the clear approach of current evidence that E @-@ cigarettes is not without risk , but only a fra@@ ction of damage caused by the smoking , we comply with our national competence .
BBC should impos@@ e noble En@@ ders , former chairman of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said to send the BBC , the BBC should stop programs like the East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial rival &quot; would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the radio @-@ charge cost should only be used to make the kind of programs not broadcast by other UK broad@@ casts .
he critic@@ ised the BBC that they are public offering public authorities which probably will probably be viewed by a smaller audience , in the hard @-@ cont@@ est@@ ing time window against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals , and radio models like the BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC Director General , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he had attempted to get into contact with BBC 4 for six years at his time in Channel 4 .
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , that would be demonstrated in un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus Communications Committee in the framework of his investigation on the future of the BBC .
if you want to hold the radio fees , what I do in medium or long term not for a good idea , you should do at least for programs that do not do or put it in order .
you will send The Voice in a first @-@ class schedule because they want to achieve a broad support for the future .
the idea that otherwise nobody would show this is a joke , it is ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , it is naturally non@@ sense .
Johnson said , &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax program is financed even without subsidi@@ zation .
the Voice is such a program such as East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own @-@ productions .
hon@@ est@@ ly , other channels would give their right arm for it .
I ende@@ av@@ our to see how this is meant to be public .
I don &apos;t think that this would decrease the BBC .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for the series , led by Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC Deb@@ d on the hunt is &quot; because of the amb@@ itions of people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to guarantee long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC will give the back the former leaders of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ ed@@ gart at the Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows like the East@@ En@@ ders should sell .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs would be able to go to BB@@ C4 , but they fulfil all their tasks , and they can , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these ob@@ sc@@ oring programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they lay them in a window , where nobody wanted to see it .
to support the communication fee , Johnson said to the Committee : &quot; I challenge you to find a rather rainy system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value in this .
of course you think all that one receives a great value for 150 Â£ per year , but for people who is a lot of money for the 150 Â£ a lot of money , ask me whether this is right , because they consume not much of the BBC .
former Sky@@ and Channel 5 CEO David El@@ stein , who also said to the Committee on Tuesday , asked that the BBC should review their Ter@@ th@@ ian mission , to form and maintain . &quot;
he said , only little bit of the BBC production would now be classified as a education - he said that it is 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % in the radio . and it should take an example of public @-@ supported television channels in Australia and Canada . &quot;
on the question of partner@@ ships , El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas as the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a hand@@ ful of television is shown and with the commercial Sen@@ alli@@ ances alli@@ ances to go everything online .
&apos; Son@@ ogen@@ et@@ ics &apos; can control brain cells by waves of sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ emat@@ odes can change onto the moment in which they are sh@@ ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound im@@ pulses .
scientists have bred wor@@ ms with genet@@ ically modified nerv@@ ous systems which can be controlled by drop@@ out of sound waves .
the tiny N@@ emat@@ odes can change the direction in the moment in which they have too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard , they are ir@@ radi@@ ated .
the im@@ pulses work through the switching of Mot@@ one@@ ur@@ on cells , which are genet@@ ically modified to carry the membrane channels that react on ultr@@ asound heads .
more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said that wor@@ ms showed the power of a new procedure , called Son@@ ogen@@ et@@ ics , which can be used in ultr@@ asound to activate a series of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Srebrenica Sal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of a day could replace the depths of brain stim@@ ulation , an inv@@ as@@ ive method that gives an electrical im@@ pulses to the brain of people for treating Park@@ inson &apos;s disease .
chocolate wor@@ ms do not react to ultr@@ asound , but chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did it when they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic air bub@@ bles .
the bub@@ bles , he found out , intensi@@ fy the waves of the ultrasonic , that leads to the wor@@ ms .
the intensi@@ fied ultr@@ asound impact on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 lines and can be found in membran@@ es of some of the wor@@ ms .
the sound waves comply with the opening of these ir@@ on@@ channels and activate the cells in which they are allocated , such a report Nature Communications .
in order to create ultr@@ asound @-@ controlled N@@ emat@@ odes , Bh@@ as@@ ani genet@@ ically modified the wor@@ ms that some of their m@@ one@@ ur@@ ns carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 channels .
when it used ultr@@ asound to the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied through the micro@@ gl@@ omer@@ ates and transmitted to wor@@ ms , where they turn the changed m@@ one@@ ur@@ ons .
the method has some simil@@ ar@@ ities with Op@@ to@@ genet@@ ics , a ground@@ breaking tool that allows researchers to switch neur@@ ons with im@@ pulses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ is@@ et@@ ics could have some advantages compared to this technique .
in contrast to light , which must be sent down to an optical fiber to the desired position in the brain , the low frequency ultr@@ asound tissue can be prevented and can be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gen@@ e@@ therapy and a therapeutic antibody , it is possible to set up human neur@@ ons in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

8 golden rules for life in student residence halls
eleven years ago , I moved as self @-@ forgotten 19th @-@ year @-@ old in a student residence , still in belief in Ber@@ ets and moral re@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the attached smile of them that I have anno@@ yed - and at the numerous , long @-@ term dis@@ comforts of others .
most of what I have learned can be dist@@ illed in eight simple rules .
the entry into student residence halls reaches from easily ner@@ able up to absolutely sho@@ cking .
it is temp@@ ting to supp@@ ress : people tell me where you come from where and where you get Sab@@ b@@ n , where you &apos;re hon@@ est@@ ly say Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a He@@ fe@@ extract h@@ ah@@ aha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
bre@@ athe out through .
and help others to do the same - Ask questions and show interest .
it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you find out human beings , which you like to talk to those with which you would not say even if your lashes are burned on fire , and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be .
let people go .
the rooms of people often turn into drinks @-@ recipes , film / night event venues and communal meeting points , but they are also the putting on which people go on and wear their under@@ wear .
here : do not think of how to start with a relationship with a relationship
Introduction To Main@@ tain a rough treatment at the University .
your room should be a refuge , but many student residence halls make a room @-@ to @-@ room @-@ B@@ um@@ mel culture that is friendly and soci@@ ally and lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone who is trying to recover .
nothing in the culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want to keep up our friendship , but you must go away to keep the energy back with you . &quot;
try to feel when a com@@ it@@ ones of soci@@ ability is exhau@@ sted - and send an SMS to kno@@ ck instead .
A@@ pro@@ po@@ s anchor : do it .
a guy in my student residence H@@ aving the idea that a not closed door was a invitation .
he saw some things .
exclu@@ de friendship by baking .
since you start the Uni at the cli@@ max of the Back @-@ Man@@ ie , the clo@@ cks at the doors of people are displayed , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ ies &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I have something b@@ aked . so , and now please do smile when I ask you a few personal questions . &quot;
homemade le@@ ver@@ ies is a good way to close friends .
their roomm@@ ates feel committed to maintain and will be associate at the end of perhaps your face with a delicious surprise .
naturally , this depends on whether you are a fixed b@@ aker .
po@@ or@@ ly mixed cr@@ um@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat that lead people sleeping , when you sleep well .
food to steal , is a common crime in student residence .
of course , the cl@@ aws of chicken is a theft , but it is the take of a drops Mil@@ k for your tea ?
check the use of the dairy farm .
the odds are good that they can say to use themselves , even if they cook in the inside .
if a man ste@@ als your stuff , is anno@@ ying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with that balanced , as my roomm@@ ates , who added to their milk to pun@@ ish th@@ iev@@ es .
she is in jail now .
you should make no noise , the people from sleep or from work .
it &apos;s not just the way to be a constant human being , but that you belong to man in the true sense of the prover@@ bi@@ ds , which are sitting in the glass of the glass .
a girl in my corridor asked her neighbours , if there is something wrong , drum &amp; bass could make something more quiet , since there was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and it had a test in the morning .
they responded to music with a loud music .
when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she left her neighbours , even two hours sleeping before she dropped their own music , shut down their door and went down to her three hour test .
would it be romantic when your future sp@@ ouse would happen to go into the same student residence ?
the other way round it would not be ab@@ out@@ ly , if you take a roomm@@ ates for your future sp@@ ouses to take care of them again , and will see them every day and may be co @-@ experienced , as they are taking over all mutual friends ?
of course , the heart of his own ways - but when a hot roomm@@ ates definitely not your future sp@@ ouse in , try at least to talk to your pay@@ roll a little understanding .
in the most exciting moment in which you noticed that someone has to lie his key in its un@@ closed room , the border between a Ul@@ k and Mo@@ b@@ bing is one , seems to be it .
a good stre@@ ak is funny , but it takes only moments until he gets to the b@@ um@@ er@@ ang .
share a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but never f@@ ails to spread a room with t@@ ooth@@ paste and sh@@ ampoo .
close your door , and place their keys in a glass of water , which you then put in the freezer - but drives their rides on the ceiling no more than twice .
terra@@ ced houses for refugees , all@@ ying , Ger@@ ing@@ will@@ er
the real estate contrac@@ tor Markus Gil@@ bo@@ died in a medium @-@ to @-@ place Eck@@ ental H@@ ousing Complex in people who do not have a lot of money .
so for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need a student space but also the mother &apos;s alone and the Ger@@ ing@@ verb@@ er . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show how to get well and build today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 year old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees are ad@@ mi@@ red on the housing market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus Gu@@ dner reli@@ es on how a affordable accommodation can be created : he builds in a project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terra@@ ced houses for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mist@@ er mer@@ cen@@ aries , many refugees are ad@@ mi@@ red on the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Pre@@ mer@@ cen@@ aries : a mass@@ aging in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for people stay in a great part here .
in view of the refugee @-@ flow we also need a living space for the next decades .
a whole band , three @-@ storey series house is the solution .
Gil@@ bo@@ im : a row House needs a f@@ ew@@ est place .
it facilit@@ ates integration .
that is different if you under@@ score people in flats .
each of the six houses built in the pilot project consists of three units for asylum seek@@ ers .
each residential unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be , that many refugees will say it &apos;s peace , I go back .
then the houses can be changed easily according to their needs .
how high are the cost ?
guesthouse : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house is worth â¬ 184 000 , without property .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction lasted for six months .
that is reasonable .
have the construction provisions un@@ complicated ?
Gil@@ deb@@ tors : I have developed my project correctly .
it always makes the dro@@ pping Dam@@ o@@ cl@@ es@@ worth special building and the position directive .
gr@@ assy .
it is still under@@ lined , who created three apartments in a row , with at least three plots .
only in the cities missing the place .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did he respond to the local church project ?
Gu@@ ild : there were those who have been accused of creating luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers .
what definitely is not right .
but do you not tigh@@ tened the compet@@ itor to pay cheap apartments ?
Gil@@ das : true , although in the last five years , we had a boom in Germany , but were built for luxury apartments which can hardly be aff@@ ord to aff@@ ord .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my project also does the message , even the normal human beings take living space . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not only refugees but also the mother &apos;s alone or the Ger@@ ing@@ verb@@ er .
I show how to meet and building well today .
this is why it is .

iOS 9 : how to receive the new iPhone OS operating system when Apple update will be released
the new operating system can be challenged by selecting to set up the app , select &quot; General &quot; and then &quot; Software Update . &quot;
if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and install Inst@@ all .
some are working after the installation of problems , since they get an error message , the message is that the &quot; software update is missing . &quot;
in order to avoid the problem , users are recommended to wait until the ons@@ lau@@ ght is going back or try to update about iTunes .
the phone itself takes you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the del@@ eting of Apps - but Apple has made it more likely to do this update due to the van@@ ishing of the updates . likewise , it will be easier if you need a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them as soon as the process is complete .
it is worth to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is close by a charge tool , so the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple is not sure that the update will be continued , as the telephone may de@@ per@@ ate on half way and lead it to a crash of updates .

G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann has supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation which supports the chairman of Alfred Klein .
this makes it possible to record chess players , who cannot bring the membership fee .
youth and talents are also supposed to be driven by .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann insi@@ sted that membership in the Chess club and also friend contact to the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; is expressed as expression of its adher@@ ence to the spa town .

in addition to advis@@ ors you can also participate in courses there .
the social Foundation takes it down from the mountain to the city center .
more precisely at the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
there a new qu@@ arti@@ ist office recently opened there .
here , immediately next to the shopping market , receive from immediate seniors and advice information as to the care insurance or services of the n@@ urs@@ ing and care insurance .
since years we have been established with our out@@ patient care staff , that often only farms will be left alone .
there are infinite questions yet .
&quot; Neither has many achievements of insur@@ ances , because the complexity of insur@@ ances will hardly be understood , &quot; explained the new managers in J@@ utta W@@ eig@@ and , who is responsible for the Anton@@ ist@@ i@@ ft and the Civil Guard , as well as for the &quot; Amadeus &quot; civil service . &quot;
besides the advis@@ ors , the new source office offers health prevention , health insurance , and wellness .
for this purpose , the Sal@@ udi@@ s was captured by boat .
therefore we can use additional offers like crash prevention , remin@@ ders or physi@@ o@@ therapeutic treatment .
the offers of the senior centre and the Sal@@ udi@@ s supplement in an ideal manner .
Sal@@ udi@@ s stands for prevention , precau@@ tion and rehabilitation .

men test for 17 year old Afgh@@ ans
the police search for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mÃ¼n@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 o &apos;clock there were three young men on foot from Bad So@@ den in the direction of Sal@@ mÃ¼n@@ ster .
one out of the group , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old communist , followed by the police his two friends at a distance of about five meters , and called to them that one would wait for him .
at this point the group was located at the height of the b@@ ft @-@ gas station .

one of these men cried out with the young people and struck this with his f@@ ist in his face .
the Vic@@ tims suffered a nose in nose and ble@@ eding out of the nose .

Dr. Frank MÃ¼ller goes to Fel@@ lows and invests 3@@ 10000 Euro
Silvia MÃ¼ller @-@ G@@ ong@@ minor and Frank MÃ¼ller ( from the left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ low .
also , Sam@@ son &apos;s I@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwart@@ z and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Cab@@ bert was also pleased to welcome you .
in many places at the country &apos;s doctors , A@@ sen@@ dorf is missing : there are luck that Dr. Frank MÃ¼ller will take on the practice of Fel@@ low on 1st October .
while Ur@@ sel falls into retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is his successor in the next few months at half a place to the side .
after a reconstruction in MÃ¼ller , MÃ¼ller will re@@ build on October 12 until then , until then he invested 3@@ 10000 Euro in the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straÃe 6 .
it was sympath@@ y on the first sight when the Fel@@ lowship took Frank MÃ¼ller and his wife Dr. Silvia MÃ¼ller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , who currently successfully completed her specialist at the Beg@@ inners Hospital and who wants to embar@@ k on their practice in practice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the m@@ iller would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Rock Stand@@ s and laugh@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as far as it was , I just called it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea in the future developed the idea to operate in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; the proximity and continuous contact to the patients are very attractive , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old MÃ¼ller .
&quot; we want to study and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
as an advantage , he also see his own boss soon .
and so one was in@@ ig , the tr@@ ash bought the house with practice .
they will continue to live in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
there is the two times @-@ called family Frank Mu@@ eller also grew up , his medical studies in Hanover followed by stations in several physician offices and in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , N@@ ien@@ burg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently active as a Senior Physi@@ cian in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed to the conduc@@ tive emergency doctor in the district of Di@@ ep@@ holz and volunteers working at the DR@@ K @-@ read@@ iness Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from 19 September , the practice is prepared for the new boss .
during the sur@@ geon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Rock Stand@@ ausen as a dent@@ ist , his wife speci@@ alize in Ur@@ sel ( Inter@@ ni@@ st@@ in ) to Gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology .
the tr@@ ash , both of them , want to be settled in ophthalm@@ ologists .
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia MÃ¼ller @-@ G@@ ong@@ minor .
after conversion , the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultr@@ asound examination as well as long @-@ term - and stress @-@ EK@@ GS and need an office room more .
in addition the ED@@ V is completely renovated .
a sub@@ sid@@ y of 50,000 Euros will get the tr@@ ash on the frame of a promotional program from the district ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the town council ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and glad we are going to be continued in practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; st@@ resses Sam@@ son &apos;s sight of Bernd bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
approximately 2000 patients are according to Silvia MÃ¼ller @-@ G@@ ong@@ a , and in the practical terms of rock climbing , in the North German tourist practice it is about 500 .
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another practice practice yet .
a positive side effect of practice by Frank MÃ¼ller : the pharmacy remains at A@@ sen@@ dorf according to the Ur@@ sel Rock Stand@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf , too .
if no successor would have been found , she would have gone .
he who visits of tr@@ ash &apos;s lesson , just looks in familiar faces , and takes over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning force of the rocky cliffs .
with their departure in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era , after all the medicine had pract@@ ised for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning , we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remember Ur@@ sel Rock Stand@@ ing sch@@ mun@@ ich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they break a little with mid@@ wives after the long time .
&quot; but we still live in the Hohen@@ mo@@ or and become often often seen many patients often , &quot; says The Inter@@ ni@@ st@@ in .
her husband is growing : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter property . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I pressed close to gar@@ dening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore the pair has two grand@@ chil@@ ds and travels .
Croatia : &quot; we let the refugees go through &quot;
&quot; we have entered the border checks at our south border , &quot; said Interior Minister , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner .
the controls on the Hungarian border will remain in parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear that everyone who wants to put an asylum request will also be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the power supply and safety of human beings are in the fore@@ ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is clear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there are clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people must not know that we do not accept borders networks , also not via the Austr@@ o @-@ Slovenian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia is denied
the Croatian government had previously informed that Slovenia would continue to leave for Austria and Germany in the direction of Austria and Germany and also to build cor@@ ri@@ dors for refugees .
but it looked at the Minister of Interior , Ves@@ na Gy@@ Ã¶r@@ head Z@@ ni@@ dar in L@@ ai@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ ri@@ dors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather re@@ prove the monitoring of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the border with Croatia is the outside border of the Schengen area already heavily controlled .
as the Minister was stressed , Sloven@@ ians wants to have its borders for refugees but not factories .
&quot; each EU member must fill out its obligations ; otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; stressed Gy@@ Ã¶r@@ head Z@@ ni@@ dar .
as the Croatian government ha@@ sted , the first refugees had already tried to attend the night hours of Tuesday in eastern Croatia to take on the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ ID in order to avoid the registration .
in the Croatian police they could rise in the lower corn fields .
according to local media , in Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , police cars ever meet with new refugees .
it was mainly for Sy@@ rer and Afgh@@ ans , among them numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , his country &apos;s country with some 4,000 refugees , Minister of Interior , Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic said .
in addition , buses from Pre@@ v@@ vo to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian Serb border , which had brought up migrants to the Hungarian border to date , had to coinci@@ de with Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
the government in Belgrade , however , failed that they may propose people to strike certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do this . &quot;
according to media reports , at least 50 refugees have arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ ID in the morning , during the day , additional buses were expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants were the whole night of the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border in Serbia around 500 kilometres .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has been admitted , so the police said that we should come here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany by Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
so it could actually be the predicted shift of the previous Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a little further west @-@ located route .
Croatia : &quot; extensive possibilities to limit control &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Minister of the Interior O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had to emphas@@ ised that his country has prepared appropriate plans for potential coverage in the case of a strong commitment by refugees .
details he did not named , but he pointed out that Croatia was a non @-@ Schengen member &apos; comprehensive options for border control . &quot;
you carry out rig@@ orous controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been a member of this since 2007 , the EU partner since then has consistently been a good witness since the border controls the border controls .
on the Serbian side , about 300 refugees were stuck behind the Hungarian border z@@ au@@ n .
according to the reports of media reports , they lost the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ g@@ os , who leads to R@@ Ã¶s@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , both border cross@@ ings will remain closed down@@ wards by hor@@ g@@ os and the par@@ i Bre@@ g .
if the remaining refugees continue to go on to the Croatian border , it is still un@@ clear .
the Serbian Home Secretary Neb@@ oj@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic still tried to calm on Wednesday early at a local moment in Hor@@ g@@ os : he keep the debates about Alternative items of refugees after the Hungarian border is closed for early .
it would not be a very high number of refugees .
they could not say if they would continue their journey over Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers in Mig@@ rants to - Dangerous goods Alternative items
however , private Hungarian refugee families have already begun to distribute the refugees crossing the country , where there are alternative routes through Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harm@@ less : in parts of the border area there are still 20 years after the end of the area of Croatia not yet a cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of min@@ ers was sent to the border region .
stock @-@ H@@ acker : Ukrain@@ ians 30 million dollars
Sup@@ pl@@ on@@ ok is supposed to have a ring of Cyber@@ crime nov@@ els , which is accused of having an un@@ published financial reports and press releases on sites like business Wire , Marketing @-@ Service and PR News@@ wire since 2010 .
with the captured information , Insider business will have been made to the financial markets .
in this way the investig@@ ators were reported to a total of over 100 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the present comparison shows that even those outside of our country limits are ultimately taken captive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it is a SEC @-@ Communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the processes against 32 further accus@@ ations in the case lasted .
most of the accused were from Ukraine and Georgia .

E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ iz@@ able Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years
there is a lively operation around the Mannheim par@@ ade@@ platz .
the people do their concern , partly fast pac@@ ed , partially comfortable lo@@ ot .
she controlled the two stations at the Mannheim car park at Par@@ ade@@ platz .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are life , therefore we are with the action in the middle of the city and under the people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the assistant of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ es support the Pass@@ ant as well as questions and talks at disposal such as the volunte@@ er personnel .
while man@@ ch a Pass@@ ant gives a spontan@@ e@@ ously to the chal@@ k and get the sentence to &quot; my life . &quot; we can continue to stop the war &quot; or &quot; not long , &quot; keep others standing in short , say , phr@@ ases like &quot; so far am I still not &quot; and continue to go on .

this public effective action was therefore good for the 20 year olds .
that is not everyone who wants to communicate in everyone on the tablets , however , is under@@ stand@@ able , last@@ ly it was a very personal matter .
the theme of death and death is to be punished according to the presence of tobacco , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine lam@@ mer which has just contributed the Hosp@@ o movement in recent years has contributed much to the people .

F@@ ed@@ Ex result mixed , financial outlook for 2016 lowered
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appo@@ inting results for the last quarter , and the Lie@@ fer @-@ Gig@@ ant lowered his winning outlook on a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his goods transport service .
the company also said that it is planning to tackle about 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for vacation .
at that time , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to adjust 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share came to over 2.5 per cent in pre@@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said that money will earn $ 10,@@ 40 and 10,@@ 90 $ in the fiscal year , ending in May , 20 cents less than in previous forecast .
anal@@ ysts were expected that according to a survey of fac@@ t@@ set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the lower view is despite the price increases , which will be 4.9 percent on average and effective on January 4 , despite higher supplements for bo@@ di@@ ments by heavy and large pack@@ ets that will be raised from November .
the company said that it will expect the result from the previous year due to cost reduction , higher income and due to its growth in online trade .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith states that the &quot; solid income increases if you expect the weaker as expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trading . &quot;
the plans for the holiday employment have been announced a day later than the rival O@@ val@@ et UPS , which is planning to hire 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional working forces , roughly the same amount as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on August 31 , F@@ ed@@ Ex was $ 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of C@@ acks Investment Research , asked anal@@ ysts predi@@ ct .
sales increased by 5 percent to 12.3 billion dollars .
six out of Z@@ acks expected to expect $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
F@@ ed@@ Ex has produced a decline in international reputation for the past years that brought net sales to its unit express delivery for stag@@ n@@ ating .
the boom in online shopping has increased the results for F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the express unit recorded higher income due to higher prices , while the result decreased due to higher operating costs in the cargo business .
at the pre@@ market trading , roughly one hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares fell by 3,@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,15 $ .
the Tuesday closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below one record high on June 11 .
at the most expected conference in the year , Federal Reserve strateg@@ ists spend two days a week in order to decide whether it is time for the first time since almost a decade to lift the console .
touching over them at a end of the decorated , double @-@ storey seat is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the map is rec@@ olle@@ ction to remember that the F@@ ed @-@ chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues will set the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a double order from Congress : maxim@@ ising US employment and rates remain stable here .
but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have been recognized that there is an independent third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too close to predi@@ ct them . it will be announced on Thursday if the US economy is ready to be we@@ ged by the unprecedented interest rate from the short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the economy show that it grows vig@@ or@@ ously , the youngest tur@@ mo@@ il of the global financial markets could already support the pre @-@ supervised F@@ ed @-@ Representative , this Vol@@ at@@ ility was to increase by the interest rate for federal government - and be it only by a quarter percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation on the first line is what they observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , Head of Economics at Mak@@ ler@@ man Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think when searching for a pre@@ text that would not increase the interest rate , increased un@@ certainty is enough to wait for the global market to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no con@@ sens@@ us about what the F@@ ed is doing , which is attributable to the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists who recently question@@ ed recently from Bloom@@ berg , have predicted a rate hike this week .
the financial markets , however , anticip@@ ate a look at the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance to increase in an increase .
this indicates a decline in the share market in case the F@@ ed raises the sentence , unless the strateg@@ ist claim the stroke , considering that an additional increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial average increased by 2@@ 28.@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed politics impos@@ e a sentence in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the propositions at that time , &quot; he said .
if they do it , you would have to calm in their statement in order to calm the financial markets so they don &apos;t come into pan@@ ic . &quot;
another experts ar@@ gue that a interest rate hike would point the financial markets because it is the un@@ certainty when the F@@ ed would act to eliminate .
even before a month , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the set by 0.25 percentage points per month , the first small step in a slow con@@ formation of the mon@@ etic conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had already said in the spring and in early summer , that in this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , more economical progress would be required to increase the proposition .
although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ ed considerably , was the improvement on the labour market this year .
the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 % over the past month , the lowest since more than seven years and within the level of the advanced level which sees the F@@ ed as full employment .
wage improvements have shown evidence of a recovery .
although inflation remained constantly under the goal of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed Represent@@ atives said that the main reason for temporary oil prices would be considerably lower .
the economy &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension in the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , Chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ media .
but the financial markets around the world had accumulated its currency since the end of the last month , after China had upgraded its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial Average value fell in May by more than 16 % among the highest level , as investors had feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would decrease global growth .
the market has recovered slightly in this month , the Dow Automotive now accounts for nearly 10 % below the May date .
for the F@@ ed Representative , the market tur@@ bul@@ ence affect the complex calculation , where to increase the interest .
&quot; when the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy would not appear in the past few weeks , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low on U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US @-@ Bank bank .
now he predi@@ ct that she will wait at least one month to get the effects better into the handle .
&quot; there is a lot of un@@ certainty on what the effects will be on the U.S. economy and there are almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the world economy is one of the main ones in the F@@ ed , so it should not be included technically in their decision @-@ making decisions .
but in the final result the F@@ ed Monetary Authority has become the world .
the influence of the Central Bank has enorm@@ ously enormous in recent years .
the blo@@ wers of the former Leit@@ ers Ben S. Bern@@ an@@ ke in 2013 that the F@@ ed could &quot; move its mon@@ et@@ ous expansion &quot; to have caused tur@@ bul@@ ations around the world .
in a world that increasingly scattered abroad , markets and econom@@ ies are increasingly being expected by the F@@ ed Representative , that they will not only super@@ v@@ ise the developments in other locations , but also with other central banks and experts to maintain a better understanding for the global economy .
their decision @-@ making is &quot; more Arts as science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the Global Strategy for Net Management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc .
Jeffrey L@@ acker , President of Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of inter@@ actions on finance market movements which is linked with apparently not associated with the economic framework data . &quot;
l@@ acker , voting rights of the Federal Open Market Committee , agreed for an interest rate hike , cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce their Leit@@ ins by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions , &quot; despite unlimited impact on growth in the US , &quot; said L@@ acker .
a year later the F@@ ed @-@ Represent@@ atives did not reverse these cuts .
the F@@ ed should set aspects of the financial stability during a serious crisis such as market crash of 2008 at the first place , Adam S. Pos@@ en , former member of the Committee on behalf of the Bank of England .
the youngest tur@@ mo@@ ors do not come near this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surely do not want to fall into the situation in which they are afraid of an interest rate because the markets are entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pos@@ en , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until it is changed , I do not believe that it should au@@ ster@@ ile at the time .

test@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small life for refugees
more refugees live in Germany at the same time .
giving them a warm welcome , do not work without our commitment to a volunte@@ er volunte@@ er hel@@ per .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a whole number of people who support illeg@@ itim@@ ate asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
they belong to them Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a body and soul teacher .
even with its 74 differences , they still always teaches .
on Thursday they made it in the asylum seek@@ ers at the D@@ ill@@ inger StraÃe .

Brazil &apos;s pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric Company Rio Grande promotes diet for healthy
the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric organization SP@@ RS tried to clari@@ fy it in the sho@@ cking way of women , how important is good nutrition during a n@@ urs@@ ing time . you do this with the presentation of pictures of babies that are painted in breasts that are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , the babies that require all nutrients to make them a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only di@@ Ã¤t@@ et@@ ical adaptation to the mothers .
a recent study under the management of Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet fluctu@@ ate women affected the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , a healthy diet of the child may affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ bar Sports Hall
the parish fair Bern@@ ward approved the building application for the 2.3 million euro co@@ gym .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be fl@@ atter for solar fl@@ am@@ ers .
the planning for the long @-@ awa@@ ited turn@@ out building at the Bern@@ bar boom arrived in step by step . in recent general meeting the extended building application was subsequently blessed without major discussions .
prior to that , the committee had agreed on an application for a &quot; respec@@ t@@ itious &quot; liberation &quot; of the valid development plan .
with the &quot; exception &quot; there was a special permission for a special shape regarding the roof construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ar@@ tic@@ ulated roof with non @-@ essential first and roof top &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
background of planning is the au@@ spices of the roof area for solar plants : &quot; as a result we get a wonder@@ fully large South East , &quot; said Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting .
in the &quot; Liberation &quot; , the g@@ un@@ le@@ verage , which is required from energet@@ ic reasons - is prescribed by otherwise than in the development plan - below ten degrees .
the volume of the hall is significantly reduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the construction plan does not per@@ tain a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - where the Bern@@ bar is usually de@@ pri@@ ved from the liberation conditions generally rather restri@@ ctive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but at the gym , this is no recur@@ ring project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger .
the sports centre at the Sports Centre is a joint venture project of the municipality and the SV Bern@@ ard@@ house .
costs are estimated at EUR 2.3 million .
grants are expected by the school and lat@@ itude promotion .
in the next step , the building application for the 18 x 36 metre hall is now submitted to the Land@@ rat@@ ory with its aud@@ iting .
P@@ ei@@ Ãen@@ berg clinic moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
P@@ ei@@ Ãen@@ berg hospital is planned to be closed as planned - in 2016 .
Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is the new member of the Medical Director at Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station as well as the majority of the staff draw up from P@@ ei@@ Ãen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
that will see the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the district court , the land was confirmed by Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
a decision to meet this , however , the Supervisory Board , and the t@@ ask@@ bar will come next Wednesday , September 23 .
plans were to be implemented , then all of the nearly 50 employees in the P@@ ei@@ Ãen@@ berg hospital are involved .
the overwhelming majority should move with fishermen and the further existing inside station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are present .
the employees who do not work with Sch@@ ong@@ au , should be offered at a workplace in W@@ eil@@ heim , such as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
the employees are informed of the plans .
it has triggered the change of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who is only since the start of the Medical Director of Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic and is now being replaced by a private practice in the immediate proximity of the hospital .
with the question who wants to join the following , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into the game which was ready to take over from 1 October to join the line and join his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au there was an &quot; appreci@@ ation &quot; and a distribution of the offer in the area of Internal Medicine , &quot; so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
fishermen is a specialist for pac@@ emaker and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ator .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) speci@@ alis@@ es in the inside station on gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
for the next two years , fishermen with his team , when the Supervisory Board is to be con@@ ferred , both houses , until then , the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ ings , which still has more than 35 beds , shall be finally closed in P@@ ei@@ Ãen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now , the district has planned this for 2018 , when the current reconstruction is completed at the hospital W@@ eil@@ heim . &quot; &quot; &quot;
governor of J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , has joined rum@@ ors that the house , which is in possession of the German sub@@ section , is to be used as an accommodation for asylum .
&quot; I close my work . &quot; as it goes on to the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White couldn &apos;t say , there may be several consider@@ ations .
currently there is a short @-@ time care of Car@@ itas and a day @-@ saving sy@@ chiat@@ ry there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what else could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not happen again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so fishermen over the Qu@@ ai move to the Le@@ ch , who had been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very compreh@@ en@@ tive &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house , has been working as a chef for more than 30 years , did not give it .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the Medical Director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ Ãen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was repeatedly threatened by closure , departments have been closed , for example the surgery and the birthday .

refugees need accommodation : study warning sever@@ ity
the situation on the German residential market is anxi@@ ous .
increasingly more refugees seek a paid lead .
pressure on housing market is growing .
the social housing is facing a challenge .
the distribution fight on the German residential market have long since begun .
with the coming refugees and labour @-@ seek@@ ers from the EU more people are increasingly on a market that is already over@@ loaded in many large cities .
they compete with income vulner@@ able citizens to survive the last paid vacation rentals .
in order to meet the demand of affordable housing , 400,000 new units have to be built by 2020 .
the result is a study on behalf of the group deb@@ its &quot; social housing &quot; . &quot;
by comparison , in Germany 26@@ 0,000 units are finished in Germany .
this makes 14@@ 0,000 apartments .
refugees have no longer oblig@@ ated after the first three months of their stay as asylum seek@@ ers in an initial accommodation .
many went to the apartment market and lined up in the long wheel@@ ers in front of the apartment dwellings .
according to Statist@@ ical Office the last year less than half of the asylum seek@@ ers lived in the last year .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only paid to the rising number of refugees .
the study also makes significant contributions in residential policy in recent years .
Germany Th@@ iev@@ es a housing deficit prior to itself , which is greater from year to year .
the currently lack of con@@ ur@@ b@@ ation already has about 77@@ 0,000 units , Matthias GÃ¼nther , author of the study .
many working professionals are therefore living in major cities in WG rooms .
young adults stayed in the &quot; Hotel M@@ um &quot; because of the floods in the home market .
the number of square meters per capita has dropped out for the first time in the last few years .
in order to solve the problem , the Alliance provides &quot; social housing &quot; a re@@ boot .
new inc@@ en@@ tives to boost the social housing development again .
this may not refra@@ in due to the s@@ under@@ age tax , and to set the basic tax for subsidi@@ zed apartments .
according to the alliance you need to obtain attractive tax @-@ effects .
the funding programme for refugee arrives at the State bank Kf@@ W are already well @-@ connected to cities and communities .
a good week after the start was on Monday night with 184 million euros more than half of the amount provided by around 300 million Euros .
now the project could even be expanded .
refugees have free money @-@ so@@ vereig@@ n@@ ty : Croatia and Slovenia include a corridor
since Hungary is virtually no longer any more , since more refugees select the way of Croatia .
Zagreb is announ@@ cing the transit of Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
however dangerous is the route however .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighboring country of Slovenia via the establishment of a cor@@ ri@@ dors for refugees .
&quot; I have spoken with the Slovenian inner Minister , and when it is necessary , we will organize a corridor , &quot; said Croatian Interior Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria and is part of the Schengen area .
the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
after the fir@@ ing of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees have broken up to Croatia to reach Western Europe .
500 people have come across the border near T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , according to the Croatian Television broadcast@@ ers in RTL .
Hungary had sealed its border for refugees at the previous day .
new laws , which came into force on the same day , make it practically unnecessary asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to leave the refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Mil@@ ano@@ vic stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they can go through and we are preparing for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , people are people who didn &apos;t want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police seized the first refugees at the Serbian border of Serbia in the morning .
most of the media reports were reported in Syria , Iran , and Afghanistan .
they went both by bus and taxi in the Serbian border town of S@@ ID .
immediately after their arrival they had attempted to arrive on foot about the green border to Croatia .
near the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , refugees not g@@ assed at the border .
for this lack of bound@@ aries are other haz@@ ards : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
mine is now supposed to make a secure passage quickly .
after the closing of the border , barely more refugees arrive after the end of the border .
on Tuesday the police counted 366 times .
just before tor@@ ment on Monday there were 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian Tax reaches the over@@ flow and damage of the border as an off@@ ence .
therefore 35 judicial proceedings were conducted in the town council of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
the convicted of pen@@ alties thre@@ aten to five years and the exp@@ ulsion from the country .
according to the immig@@ ration authority , we have received a total of 94 asylum seek@@ ers on Tuesday , including almost all - 93 - most important ra@@ fts .
among the candidates , 13 families with small children and two older people .
on Wednesday morning there would even have been 40 refugees .
however , virtually no one has a view to get granted asylum in Hungary .
according to Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; safe third country . &quot;
the previous asylum seek@@ ers will be delivered there .
in front of the &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ one &quot; in R@@ Ã¶s@@ z@@ ke only a few hundred refugees assembled .
in R@@ Ã¶s@@ z@@ ke workers began to re@@ aming .
so they collected the tr@@ ash , which caused tens of thousands of people over the past few weeks .
pl@@ ywood were dismant@@ led and rebuilt by a close @-@ up plant in the border place .
the aim of this building would not want to express itself .
after the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary , there are only few refugees .
in addition , the country has strengthened its border controls .
but about 20,000 migrants were still in the country , but still in the country .
in Salzburg approximately 1400 people are waiting for the further drive to Germany .
the train from there to Germany was stopped in the morning by the German authorities .
in Shimano countries a few small groups of refugees meet on foot .
mayor of the crossed &quot; over the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we went after Br@@ Ã¼cken@@ fest on Sunday with the getting up , when suddenly ten people stood with rice offices at the entrance of the tent , &quot; Wer@@ n@@ erst@@ one mayor Alois Stad@@ ler . &quot;
tourists , they wanted to go by train to Pass@@ au .
because Germany had sur@@ pris@@ ingly contra@@ cted the railway traffic with Austria on Sunday , the city council for them in Wer@@ n@@ stein , &apos; so Stad@@ ler who immediately offered his help and the st@@ aid along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars over the border to the near Pass@@ au .
previously , we have secured the un@@ expect@@ edly guests only once , with snack and beverages .
we have said we take it by car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so Stad@@ ler im O@@ Ã@@ N conversation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grat@@ eful .
a man did not take it to pass a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; we are very happy , &quot; so Stad@@ ler .
the previous train ators went on Sunday evening in Wels , from a ICE in a regional train towards Pass@@ au , in order to be re @-@ discontinued after the short notice that the rail traffic was shut down to Germany , yet to try over the border .
the regional train was turned off at the Inn in Wer@@ n@@ stein am Inn .
in Wer@@ n@@ stein , the border @-@ border will generally be in the course .
the bridge Festival with the Bavarian N@@ eigh@@ bours on Sunday , Sunday prior to a double @-@ bridge sports - organized by Union Wer@@ n@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
the Viktor Or@@ b@@ Ã¡n accepts another 40 000 en@@ cers to us - this is a logical result of the apparent field of view :
rather than in the camp R@@ Ã¶s@@ z@@ ke immediately helps to ensure human@@ eness , our Federal Chancellor has officially launched , and publicly presented the attitude of Hungarian government in the Dun@@ st@@ o of National Soci@@ alism .
Lei@@ d@@ tra@@ des of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans con@@ fron@@ ted now in the bound@@ aries with cha@@ otic states .
also the pl@@ ough@@ s have to be said that the &quot; yellow land , &quot; which they invited , and welcome , nothing comes to another refugee camp .
it will be a major challenge , in view of the continued refugee and flows of the coming winter , to present human circumstances for protection @-@ seek@@ ers .
and there will be an even greater on peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad on the Search for 35,000 people
Konrad has fully put aside all hands with the refugee removal .
Christian Konrad is there to be his Word in weight .
the government has used the former mighty Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to al@@ locate tra@@ arti@@ facts for the thousands of refugees .
the Chaos in the First Quarter of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already given a grip on Konrad .
&quot; we have no homeless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported on his first success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also , the lodging of the 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday was without major vort@@ ex , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and pra@@ ising the organis@@ ational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master output &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Interior Ministry on the other hand of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ris@@ ky situation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
additionally , Konrad has a demand of 85@@ ,000 quartz glass in the he@@ ur@@ ian year .
in order to meet the number , 35,000 accommodation must still be found in the next few weeks - 20.000 will provide the federal states .
if there are more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there is no wet without ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already carried talks with the state capit@@ als .
these would have been added to him even for the coming refugees Qu@@ arti@@ ere .
&quot; in Upper Austria it goes well , &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar does Konrad .
tomorrow it will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph SchÃ¶n@@ born , it should be clari@@ fied as the church will help .
the asylum @-@ ordin@@ ator sets out great expectations even in the ORF @-@ Action &quot; Hel@@ ps as we . &quot;
on the platform , individuals can offer non @-@ complex accommodation .
in addition one hopes to see hotels that are empty in winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ises the standards for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly high &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last night . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in case of not@@ ices , there cannot be that squ@@ e@@ ors have to keep a certain amount of hand fast@@ eners or the size of the finishing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary time it would have to apply &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emer@@ gency Standard &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unlike the interior of the Interior , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unlike the Interior Ministry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Home &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Konrad with his experience &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am an older gent@@ lem@@ an , whom we do not say without something in the face .
persu@@ asion is its most important gun .
Konrad and Mai@@ er cause the Republic to inflic@@ t no costs such as they declared themselves .
their number of employees want to raise it to three to four .
the own qu@@ arti@@ er@@ go had not yet been successful yet .
Konrad has wanted to put a container on the st@@ eph@@ an@@ splatz in the office .
but there are obviously problems with permission .
Linz ur@@ ges a better spl@@ itting
recently , no opening of urban sport halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ arena and design center for the accommodation of refugees is planning the city of Linz .
at the moment , this is not necessary since the person concerned has to place that without these measures , Mayor Klaus Lug@@ er ( SP ) says .
for emer@@ gen@@ cies , further locations should be checked on their divers .
criticism of the city dra@@ fts from the breakdown of refugees in the country of the country .
other districts must also aff@@ ord its contribution .
se@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders shall not be sealed &quot;
in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian Minister @-@ President Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ oo@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday other proposals aiming to re@@ claim the refugee question .
sea level has as@@ sures me that the German border will not be sealed .
the journey of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany are still possible .
however there is just the relevant border checks .
special trains with refugees after Germany will not be able to give it no more .
the g@@ ad@@ dic@@ ure would however be brought to Germany with regular trains .
in the other EU member states , P@@ oo@@ inger collected more reinforced solidarity in the refugee question once more .
that now Austria leads to the bound@@ aries of controls , is a logical consequence , &quot; a logical consequence , &quot; from the pre @-@ war of the Germans .
the next R@@ unt@@ astic is a question of time
the general overhau@@ l of the &quot; New ship@@ yard &quot; in the liner industry line is officially completed .
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the Stock Exchange IT Group S &amp; T is entered and the rest ( 2700 square meters ) is to be rented for young , innovative companies from the technology area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the IT the clever people are of our raw material - and we must try to work for us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T boss Hannes low haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine to invest in start@@ up companies of the New ship@@ yard , and later also to acquire .
at the beginning of the beginning , S &amp; T wants to co@@ operate with the new neighbours - some of which belonged to the estate : &quot; the next r@@ unt@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
1.7 million euros invested by S &amp; T in the location , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ center , which belongs to a third of the city of Linz , the country Upper Austria and the federal government ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is managed by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ center .
30 percent of the 2700 square metres area in the building are already rented out , for another 40 percent give it in@@ quiries .
L@@ ia @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ ard opened second business in the Ark@@ cade

this project had to post@@ pon@@ ed the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of L@@ ia Per@@ oni in the exchange market ar@@ cade : after all , she has now gained moment@@ um in the form of a further business location .
in the Fur@@ la @-@ shop towards the business in which they sell among other bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and vest@@ ments of various producers , everything went for ladies hand@@ bags of the Fur@@ la , money stock exchange from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop is in operation since yesterday .
previously , several weeks was rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I don &apos;t consider whether I want to open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Bre@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision was decisive for the decision to make sure that the Fur@@ la producers who are home in Bologna , from the idea of a site , to which only your hand@@ bags are sold , were being done .
&quot; we are the only artists in the large area of Linz , which this brand sell , &quot; says the mother of two daughters , who has even Italian roots .
her fashion interest has gotten Bre@@ it from her mother in the cra@@ dle .
I meet most at all , when something has been developed and I can show new trends at competitive prices .
why some woman in the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in ornam@@ ents is also possible to answer the house@@ wife not with the last security .
perhaps it is clear that a beautiful bag is util@@ ized for each out@@ fit .

the native K@@ all@@ stÃ¤d@@ ter has shot a am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous jumps on which beside Tr@@ ump also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up @-@ family Heinz belongs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump , which is not known for conf@@ ession , comes in &quot; kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would be surely successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he didn &apos;t bring it to the king of the hearts .
indeed , respect to the performance of the family , but also ten@@ ds the opinion that Tr@@ ump &quot; was a bit of a big Mo@@ or@@ ish , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
a random lau@@ ched the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the Vic@@ inity , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ &quot; es@@ macher &quot; - too high : the anus says she says .
Tr@@ ump is coming from the village of the anus .
the tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 when the later big grandfather sett@@ lers and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
founding of the real estate company was the first piece in New York .
but life of grand@@ parents was not free of Tra@@ y : their desire to return to the country , failed on the Bavarian state , to which the Palat@@ inate was at that time .
he did not receive tr@@ ump , because he was once off without hom@@ ologation , the Director of the Institute of Des@@ pe@@ zo@@ ological History and Eth@@ no@@ graphy , Roland Paul , was declared a film start .
tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of a &quot; illegal emig@@ ration . &quot;
this is in contrast to the mit@@ ig@@ ated statements of the estate .
he had repeatedly spoken about Mexican immig@@ rants in the United States and demanded the construction of a border to make illegal immig@@ rants .
&quot; as the pol@@ der it is not so lik@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a covered k@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a born tr@@ ump , the op@@ a @-@ born Heinz &quot; ) .
the win@@ emaker in retirement is the Americans rather dist@@ anced , &quot; he is always so excited . &quot;
do he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the Pension Company is mentioned in Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ramm , a no@@ blem@@ ish that a desc@@ endant of the family Heinz came to a visit for the church organ , which was generally well preserved .
&quot; that can &apos;t imagine what I do not imagine , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are better if he don &apos;t understand the choice , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such a radical view , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if those , who had been in the USA during his grandfather in the USA , had been as he had , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is an interesting topics like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ - Sarah BÃ¼h@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as a President ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my President is not it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says she . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe for the president Tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
W@@ end@@ els Film , who was inter@@ viewed for the tr@@ ump , have seen 12 000 slides , even in the USA wake up interest .
Germany &apos;s first &quot; Berg@@ stei@@ ger@@ dorf &quot; is the Upper Bavaria in Ram@@ s@@ au near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden .

a &quot; Berg@@ sti@@ ger@@ dorf &quot; may have at most 2500 inhabitants .

seven &apos;s sunrise domin@@ ates the reviews , despite attempts to adopt the loss of leadership in the USA Today
Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ k@@ inson wins to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report the leadership of the leadership of Liber@@ al &apos;s leadership , but there was no major shift in the reviews for Today .
the Nine @-@ Show of Nine was broadcast@@ ed by the Federal State since Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ s abolished the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
in London , the rival David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ days , assembled in London as part of a one @-@ week series of international television programs , including Dubai , New York , Niagara Falls and Cancun .
this dis@@ advantage of the losses seemed to play no role in Australian TV viewers , as Sunrise Period 39@@ 7,000 in front of the five main cities , compared with Today 33@@ 9,000 .
Today , Today posted a slight increase from the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
Today , Today finally closed the gap between sunrise .
in August , Today posted an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 33@@ 0.000 of Sunrise .
at the beginning of the year the distance between 40.000 and 50.000 .
in September , Sunrise stands at an average of 34@@ 9.000 spectators at 3@@ 14.000 in Today .
this is the most interesting one happened every morning .
the winds of change affect these early morning more than the parliament !
Karl and Lisa is fine , thank you for the review !

the great new@@ bor@@ ess for Seven was the impressive dÃ©@@ but of 800 words with the former standard star of packed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thomson .
the new drama created by a recently promised Father , who decided to break down with his two children at the coast of New Zealand , reached an impressive figure of 1.@@ 219 million viewers .
critics had asked if Thomson could bear a hit @-@ show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
the result of last night answered this with a clear &quot; Yes . &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and struck easily The Block ( 8@@ 38@@ ,000 ) and T@@ BL Famil@@ ies ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .
seven had mixed results on evening two of The Chase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17.30 p.m. ) of the new quiz Show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ e@@ fe , on average 4@@ 46@@ ,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ ump@@ ed on 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires hot @-@ seat ( 6@@ 13,000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Chase Australia generated 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour 7@@ 20,000 .
hot seat on average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the ratios of the second evening of The Chase Australia will agree to Nine , that hot @-@ seat will ultimately succeed at 17 : 30 .
the Chase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars per minute that didn &apos;t manage the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires show .

the last three voices were : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki might possibly be ignor@@ ant who The Bachelor wins .
the woman in which Sam Wood was fin@@ ed at the Bachelor &apos;s degree in 2006 .
and there won &apos;t be any of the three left girl will certainly not give her whether she is the one who received the last Rose .
but when we came with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before they are going to be checked , you might want to see a hint to you who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips to the final on Thursday sealed
all three women have left the way out why wood is the perfect man , and they called his mind for humor , hon@@ est@@ ing , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be its partner in its partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you don &apos;t , who would have the last Rose &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; they could send their answers to the game , who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki quickly named both - apart from itself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner in wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood had an easy relationship from the first day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the moment I went into the house and ( Sar@@ ah ) and Sam@@ s energies , I felt that they were quite compatible , and I thought it was in the entire course of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Je@@ di@@ ons Fel@@ lows . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sarah is standing with both feet on the earth , it &apos;s so much fun to be along with her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have seen them together , and they &apos;ve got the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she would be well suited for Sam Wood as a couple .
from their point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house visit last week apparently made it clear that wood could be &quot; the One . &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and the family , it was clear to me that this is obviously not only a game - I didn &apos;t want to leave it now , &quot; she said .
and when asked to choose who wood could choose , if she was not there , she was en@@ ig@@ matic .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said .
I love the left girls equally . it is a battle between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor &apos;s degree is broadcasting on top ten on Wednesday , 19 : 30 .

Jar@@ y@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start your NF@@ L career .
in Detroit and Seattle there were much interest after his move to the United States - and there were many other teams that sent en@@ qu@@ eries after his impressive open day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ n chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
some coach would have banned the rest of the game to the Bank when he lost a rum@@ ble as it took to the Aus@@ sie Rug@@ by League bank@@ rupt@@ cy on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula confi@@ ded to his husband , and Hay@@ es gave the next opportunity to return to a P@@ unt @-@ return and in the ongoing game after an injury of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula still showed his true face in the dressing unit after the game .
instead of his ro@@ ok@@ ies prior to the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ ne &apos;s also publicly in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Sport@@ re@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by the expert coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey to forget his in@@ pat@@ ched f@@ ang and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne &apos;s pat@@ ched in a p@@ unt , which was restored in the first quarter of Minnesota &apos;s vic@@ ings
it certainly was not the start , the Hay@@ es and his massive Australian business success for his NF@@ L made in 2006 .
Hay@@ ne went out after the f@@ um@@ ble curse the playing field and later told the Australian Radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could no worse start into his NF@@ L career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s a thing which would come about once , one takes care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne has compared the Schn@@ itzer with his Origin in 2007 , when a pass managed to the T@@ ry for Queens@@ land in 2007 , when a pass managed to Queens@@ land .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

4 people killed , after police officers have shot bun@@ ks in Nepal against demonstr@@ ators in Nepal .
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police fired rubber strips in a human amount , demonstr@@ ating against the proposed new constitution , a public officer said on Wednesday .
violence broke out at the Rup@@ an@@ expan@@ i district , approx . 175 miles west from the capital city Kathmandu .
Bish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad Dh@@ ak@@ al , Head of District Apostle , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had assembled from a police station , taking some of them stones and burnt bombs .
Mr Dh@@ ak@@ al said the police have used lac@@ ri@@ eng@@ as and then put back into the air before re@@ trac@@ ing them on rubber .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the total rubber blades are known , of which is known that they may be killing , which are traditionally used as less dead@@ ly alternative , evi@@ d@@ ently produced a high death rate .
the conflict was the last week of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern levels , where members of the Eth@@ nic Group of the Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces formed in the context of the proposed new constitution would decrease its political influence .
there were also protests in the Western Europe by the Eth@@ nic Group of Bel@@ arus that want to have a State .
at least 40 people including 11 police officers , have been in violent actions since the 10 .
August was killed when the four major political parties had signed an agreement - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversi@@ al issue in Nepal , which has been governed by hundreds of centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on the road since 2008 , but the mag@@ ist@@ rates accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .

what exactly one hectare of the area of the former restaurant is located , however , is still open .

Google starts bling campaign donations to collect $ 11 million for refugees
Google Inc . ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a dou@@ bling donation campaign to bring out the US $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations , who will help thousands of refugees who have killed the European Nations , as they flee from the war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to the announcement of donations from donations on his blog .
instead of a manager wants to make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google @-@ employee , who had fled to her family from Kabul , she was seven years old when she was seven years old , about her personal experience .
&quot; one of our journey included many dark lines and bus trips , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and anxi@@ ety , &quot; wrote them .
I was lucky .
but as the refugee and mig@@ rants grew up in Europe , many people are looking for des@@ per@@ ate to help me like my family .
the donations go to four non@@ profit organisations providing assistance for refugees and migrants : doctors without Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first global donations collected up to a value of 5.5 million to goo@@ gle@@ .com / Cor@@ er@@ el@@ ief will doubled to $ 11 million .

for slightly overweight diabet@@ ics , weight loss surgery may be beneficial .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easy @-@ to @-@ use people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say if easily transl@@ ate into overweight people with diabetes after the weight loss surgery is longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mortality data is a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , a expert in weight loss surgery , one of the editorial staff of the new study in J@@ ama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss Operations and o@@ bes@@ ity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to accept food .
over the years , o@@ bes@@ ity was proven as efficient for the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most trials were carried out by people , whose disease is ob@@ ese , with a Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a certain degree of weight regarding size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BMI of 25 or more indicates that som@@ eb@@ ody is overweight , and people with a BMI of over 30 are considered ob@@ ese .
you can calculate your BMI : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , researchers from Tai@@ w@@ an Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital Road used to have collected them in a study since 2007 and compare two types of o@@ bes@@ ity surgery - gast@@ ric b@@ ypass and stomach cancer - for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily overweight .
the average BMI amongst those who subjected to this operation decreased from 31 to 24@@ ,5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BMI in those who have non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments were approximately equal to 29 .
among those who subjected to a surgical procedure , 36 percent dissolved the diabetes condition both and at 28 % partially .
in the medical @-@ treated groups it was dissolved in comparison with the diabetes in just one percent , and in some cases only approximately two percent .
in addition , the results of the control of blood pressure , tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ de and of the &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L Chol@@ ester@@ ins , were generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group .
the researchers toler@@ ate the patient @-@ blood level of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c which reflects the blood gl@@ ucose levels during the time .
hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c is best kept at 7 percent , write the researchers .
after surgery , the average hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level decreased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , in the medical therapy group there remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; glyc@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - how to reflect in the improved hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level - did not reduce the mortality in five years , the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team has also been compared with the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass group had lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ re@@ kt@@ tom@@ y group ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) and ha@@ em@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded for a complete transition of the diabetes ( 4@@ 6.9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show a survival benefit from surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of heavier people in Sweden , that an operation leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was subjected to ob@@ ese people suffering from o@@ bes@@ ity surgery , about 29 percent less likely in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that attempted to conventional methods .
although the new study showed no advantage of survival in surgery patients said Black@@ stone , it could be soo@@ thing for people with a BMI below 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in the lower BMI group , &quot; without an increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said .
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors begin to take weight seriously once the patient lies with its BMI between 27 and 30 hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait for long before we bring people to take it seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think that once they have accumulated these genet@@ ically modified changes that have been associated with o@@ bes@@ ity and diabetes , one in@@ version is really hard . &quot;
love story is played in the H@@ uns@@ r@@ Ã¼ck
it is a theme that is currently found in the Fiction Bestseller : a young woman , too popular and un@@ mist@@ ak@@ ably , meets the Sch@@ warm of her youth after years , and this fell in love with them .
even in the recently published novel , we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der .
beyond the love story , the novel is especially interesting to H@@ uns@@ ets readers , because it plays in Lang@@ we@@ iler and the surrounding villages .

&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
Europe could not receive all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and said that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East rose .
the Tibetan Buddh@@ ist leaders ur@@ ged to end violence in the home country of refugees .
the Dalai Lama spoke the problem of continuous refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford which is dedicated to eth@@ ics studies .
he demanded that the interests of humanity should be set before the interests of the individual nations or even continents under the given circumstances .
he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries on the refugee crisis is ad@@ mi@@ red , but the situation is not reasonable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the Dalai Lama and Austria &apos;s efforts to pra@@ ising the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees , is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as real peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim lands , &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the end , we must think about how the k@@ ill@@ ings is reduced in her countries .
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama said the problem of violence against and commented on George &apos;s actions after the terror attack of 11 September and exhibited that the violent reaction of the USA went into a chain of un@@ control@@ l@@ able events .
after September 11 , in a letter to President Bush , in a letter I told him , the way to solve this problem is in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know , his moti@@ fs were good , but he set violence , and that caused indig@@ nation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four @-@ fold increase of removal of suspension in children over the last 4 years
po@@ ison control centers in the United States report on an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 , which swal@@ low strong alcoholic tre@@ un@@ ks , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord L@@ op@@ ez , director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of income inf@@ ar@@ ments in children under 12 are commen@@ cing the tox@@ ins of control centers , from 3,@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are increasingly being more common in this products , and unfortunately , a percentage of them go down in the note , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ op@@ ez CN@@ N &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children of disinfect@@ ants are deliber@@ ately drinking , while some are doing to im@@ press their friends or because of a mut@@ ing of the social media .
videos on YouTube show how young disinfect@@ ant can only drink for one budget adventure .
te@@ ens have supp@@ os@@ edly mixed disinfect@@ ant with soft mouth water to obtain a har@@ der drink .
younger children can be accompanied by attractive lob@@ bies of disinfect@@ ant .
&quot; one child doesn &apos;t think that this is bad for it , &quot; said L@@ op@@ ez .
many of the attra@@ ci@@ des ( hand @-@ disinfect@@ ant ) are those who are par@@ don@@ ors .
there are disinfect@@ ant with straw@@ berries , grapes and orange shower , which are very attractive for children .
removal of walls contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
particularly with to@@ dd@@ lers , few sy@@ ring@@ es can result in alcohol in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; telling Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , Medical Director of the Gi@@ ft@@ on Center at the University of Kansas , the Fox 4 in Kan@@ sa City .
so , you would not leave a si@@ p whis@@ key , but people leave this hand sol@@ ver in reach of children , and when children come in it , then it is a quick way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently had taken four sy@@ ring@@ es from straw@@ berry du@@ f@@ ten@@ ment in the school , was brought to treatment in an emergency absorption .
her blood alcohol level was 179 , twice higher than the threshold , which is considered to be legally stipulated when adults said Dr. Chris R@@ it@@ ch@@ ey , a doctor who previously treated with the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah caught up their words and was unable to go in a position when she arrived in the camp .
doctors exc@@ essive them over night in a separate children &apos;s hospital at the signs of Hir@@ n @-@ Trau@@ ma , since the girl dropped by the alcohol and did cast down the head , said R@@ it@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; it was very anxi@@ ous , &quot; said Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ ahu &apos;s mother , CN@@ N .
it could be fatal for my child .
L@@ op@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers , non @-@ alcohol @-@ free products or disinfection products outside the baby &apos;s reach .
some disinfect@@ ants were associated with deaths from alcohol in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario died women , after the swal@@ low of hanging arms representing a toxic , non @-@ declar@@ ated ingredient .
employees of health authorities believe that the product me@@ thanol included , a dead@@ ly solution , instead of eth@@ al@@ k@@ ohol , which was listed as active ingredient .
in January , three students of the fourth class in the State of New York City breaks out to po@@ is@@ oning her &quot; female teacher , &quot; she claims anti@@ bacterial products around the class@@ room , so there are a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic against suspension des@@ serts , and arranged them out of their room .

the lack of title competition in Scottish football / Germany - de Bo@@ er
the former ch@@ ord player and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Cel@@ tic , there &apos;s no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the rank .
de Bo@@ er , currently a ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland , they show no highlights of the Cel@@ tic games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the rank is not there .
people don &apos;t talk about the return of the leader@@ boards .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what you are interested in .
there is a lot of voltage in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m Games , and there are not only the people in Scotland that want to see these games .

now we want to come back as soon as possible .
I know , it is very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel that - but we must go on .
we really need , really the support of Cel@@ tic because that makes the players better .
now summar@@ izing is so important .

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while rising in the United Kingdom in total .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July in 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom had increased by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.9 percent was about 5.5 % above the population of 5,5 percent , as the figures for National Statistics ( dating only ) showed .
in the meantime total employment in Scotland began around 12,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12,000 .
in the course of the quarter , employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
the state Secretary for Scotland , who commented on the latest numbers , said : &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;
it &apos;s almost a year ago that Scotland hit the historical decision to stay part of the United Kingdom .

why I become a witness of their execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
something later today , except with a late registration intervention , I will look on how a man will be brought to death .
when it happens , and I hope that it will not happen , I will sit in an audience gallery in the death chamber at the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary where Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is ex@@ iled by the po@@ ison injection .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death .
the invitation was first mentioned for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked right to the meeting .
when the day closer , I started to fear .
so , why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
a unique perspective would offer .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see in the USA , and there are often more applications than seats available , a common lot@@ tery will take place to decide if you choose .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
who will be selected , that will observe it a emotional point .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit beside Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps of closest friend , with which I have developed my own relationship over the course of months with telephone and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh often if we speak .
the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to show a not@@ ebook and a pin , to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist , from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , accused me of having on Twitter , my im@@ part@@ ness .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner , as he wants it and you will get access .
I compl@@ ained with it .
she dre@@ amed that she could make it better . &quot; but it still th@@ inks that it is wrong , what I do .
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had problems with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he wants us to write an international re@@ porter to sign there .
when he dies , he th@@ inks that the Public Relations Work effectively will help the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ goods , a representative of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit in addition to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please hear the Pod@@ casts &apos;s series that I made .
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details here .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his acts pursuant to the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fic@@ i@@ ent crime .
but I believe that there is a strong lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe sure there is no sufficient evidence in order to just@@ ify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him .
I cannot say really obj@@ ec@@ tively .
there will be other re@@ porter , to which you can apply .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man of unnecessary death .

Peter Moo@@ dy claims that st@@ ew@@ ards tried to express him out threat@@ ening the racing
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that the st@@ ew@@ ards of Racing Victoria tried to install a sp@@ y in his st@@ ables in the past year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he carried out the st@@ ew@@ ards and the integrity of Racing Victoria and claimed that they were doing a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Sc@@ rat@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race @-@ day treatment , the last stro@@ h@@ eck on Wednesday , carried out .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tried to do that is best for racing , and he himself found under difficult conditions as it went to be the positive co@@ b@@ alt @-@ free sample of Li@@ dar@@ is that he cannot explain .
he had kept back 18 months because of the sp@@ y alleg@@ ations and did not want it to see &quot; out how high hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about this , and I have long been on it , but sometimes you are so fru@@ str@@ ated that everything comes out once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it was far@@ med .
I respon@@ ds to re@@ acts and I have to live with the consequences , and I have to live what I said .
I &apos;m going to go home and sleep well today .
I would like to go around the head , and I want to think that my owners , I try my best to them .
when you start thinking , I do not do that , then I should not be a coach .
I then should remember what I do with my license .
prior to that Moo@@ dy had up@@ loaded the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com announced that the integrity Department tries to interpre@@ t its barn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eigh@@ teen months ago Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart , sitting in a room with a man - whom I will name - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do in my st@@ alls , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy on Rac@@ ing.com . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they believe that I am a che@@ at .
if that is the case , they should surely put on their ases , because they have in the attempt to hold me , failed .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former chairman of Route L , David Moo@@ dy , current CEO of Route L and Bernard Sa@@ un@@ dry , current CEO of Route L , were aware of this time and still today .
should I bring this to the view , that it is personally ?
did the Route L hold down and makes people outside of train@@ ers responsible for what is going to be in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think there outside , that I am there .
perhaps they have to take my license and cast me away , and I have no doubt that what I say you can now think about it .
but I am now at the point where it is no matter , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
I will ex@@ ert the pressure on them , and push it to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the fru@@ str@@ ations level of the trainer have been rebuilt with the long lasting co@@ b@@ alt @-@ investigation in Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate Sc@@ rat@@ ching led to that he could take the &quot; his license on the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known for his preparation of the un@@ eliminated champion Black C@@ avi@@ ar , the race @-@ tags @-@ treatment rule , called &quot; ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous &quot; after a pack of mud or tone was applied to the horse de@@ but@@ s .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing sports .
I have to accept the full responsibility , &quot; he said .
&quot; one of my staff is applied er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously on the leg .
it would have been evening last night .
it would have been like yesterday the whole day so that it was so .
but it had been so on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could con@@ fron@@ ted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the packing on the race day . an investigation of this matter has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who set these rules do not know about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules but here you go too far , &quot; said Moo@@ dy .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy strikes against Ri@@ vals because of claims to w@@ rest@@ ling
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy has referred with his player as &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League &apos;s favourite among the N@@ RL .
Sydney Roo@@ ster Robinson said that the refer@@ ee refer@@ ee to the Storm players &quot; Ring@@ fight &quot; with his team during the high @-@ wheel seat in Sydney on Friday evening .
Brisbane Aston Martin Bennett made a scar@@ cely missed difference to the Storm Team , after his team had reached the final victory against North Queens@@ land C@@ ow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; sample thing &quot; of Rug@@ by League , saying that the two from Queens@@ land had not &quot; too good &quot; in the rings .
Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team and told that she just concentr@@ ates on her &quot; Contact &quot; at Tac@@ mb@@ o .
Bell@@ amy added that the cr@@ iti@@ que of two leading train@@ ers in his team agree that they are wor@@ ried that they would be wor@@ ried about by the Storm Team .
&quot; that appears again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson was defeated in Ring@@ ways when they defeated us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ amy Tuesday .
I can guarantee that we have changed anything in our def@@ ective system or the techniques in the whole year , but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with tac@@ kl@@ es to a real focus , and this has achieved for us the turn@@ around .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he has obviously has a great team . he is therefore probably not to lose it , so it was a bit of shock for him .
it is true , as it appears to happen again in the season .
Bell@@ amy has attacked the idea of &quot; thr@@ illing football &quot; and his ment@@ or reminds us that Ben@@ net@@ ts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons will hit the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; long @-@ sided &quot; football .
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
he died on Friday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
I remember that in 2010 St George when a bor@@ ing team was critic@@ ised , and Wayne said that he will take care of a di@@ vor@@ ce .
but now he has a team that can play and see it as exciting , especially its young players with their speed .
that is the ball game you want to play if you have this type of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , and now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so they can play as they play .
I build up confidence , because they say these things , because they are a little concerned , to play against us .
six weeks ago , they did not think about us when it went around the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy pointed out that the game Storm score a higher result than the game bron@@ cos against C@@ ow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts in our game but is this an exciting game ?
or are breaks and no points are cl@@ aws ?
for me it is the sched@@ ules .

en@@ rol@@ ment with $ 200,000 - deposit to Drug Ad@@ mission
a man , which may have a li@@ fel@@ ong sentence of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , have been transferred to Queens@@ land , but was released to a deposit of $ 200,000 .
Marko Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and placed in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed , as he met his co @-@ def@@ endants during the mid@@ day and later at the CafÃ© Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a possibly Li@@ fel@@ ong sentence for trying to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , argu@@ ed that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the entire amount and that in the cafÃ© it could have been a harm@@ less reason .
the judge by the Supreme Court of Justice , Peter Flanders , was concerned about the threat of damage in Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he declared Court on Wednesday .
during the criminal case he was lying with the police on his position .
Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ics mother and Bo@@ at &apos;s father had offered a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security offered to get his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the declar@@ ations of both persons , it is clear that the edition of a 200,000 dollars security constitutes a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Richter Flan@@ agan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this alone will not be enough to do it , not to appear to appear .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released against security deposit , under the conditions that he announces his Australian and his Serb Pass , holding the police daily and holding itself at a set block from 18 : 00 until 06 : 00 .

the mass makes it : every two years the car will show her novel@@ ties at the IAA .
in 2015 , Bosch is primarily evident with the compact car market that currently sell very well .
cars from the compact class are currently being asked : around 28,@@ 1 percent of new registrations were accounted for by the Federal Office ( KBA ) in August alone on this segment .
this is also reflected at the International Motor Show ( Audi@@ ence Days from 17 to 27 September ) .
between all the fut@@ ur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars , many new compact models will be introduced this year .
one of the largest premier@@ es for the German car industry is the Opel Astra that will stand at deal@@ er@@ ships in autumn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Astra is an extremely important model , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann on the Mass . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he belongs to the core of the brand .
that the volume model should also be sold well , the new Astra is also not much more expensive .

the Astra comes with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the H@@ esse launches further diesel and gasoline engines ranging from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for the first time three @-@ cylinder petrol engines .
in contrast to the most important compet@@ itor , VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra will initially be five @-@ fifth .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the estate , which is already visible at the IAA .
and what is up next to the Astra at the IAA still in new compact cars ?
Renault MÃ©@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra rival to MÃ©@@ gan@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; during the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; MÃ©@@ gan@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is only one @-@ fifth in a conventional and under@@ lines spor@@ tive GT version . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the trade is coming from the beginning of next year , then as a com@@ bi .

J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are worthy of human unt@@ ou@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court has been right to an ex @-@ in@@ mate of the Te@@ gel law from prison , which was packed for months in a small cell .
because of the violation of their lives , prisoners are generally eligible to compens@@ ate for financial compensation when they are accommodated in small cells .
this decision was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision dated Wednesday .
those affected could even hope for money when they were imprisoned for only a few days in the close to narrow spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
this was an ex @-@ in@@ mate to his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe . it was successful in the Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel from June to November 2009 . it was housed in a single cell with approximately five square meters of ground surface ; the toilet was not dis@@ connected .
after that , the man , who had been transferred back to the free foot , according to his lawyer , has been laid down in a larger cell .
his duties are obj@@ ection due to the un@@ worthy living conditions against the Land of Berlin .
however , the constitutional court took the verdict of the chamber court in Berlin and referred the case back to the renewed exam .
they see the man &apos;s man viol@@ ated the man .
Chamber of Chamber now resol@@ ves the amount of compensation
even if legal reasons are valid for the period only a few days of liability for the compensation would have been responsible for compensation , it was a compensation verdict .
otherwise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cur@@ v@@ ature of the legal protection of personality is to be afraid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber of Chamber now has to solve the amount of money damage .
the constitutional complaint was often strengthened by the right of prisoners in the past .
so they pronounced only in April to a det@@ ain@@ ee prevention , because he was imprisoned naked in a single cell .
according to a Commission Decision of 2011 the multiple cells of a cell is also without a separate toilet .
in addition , on Wednesday , the Berlin Constitutional Court , on Wednesday , confirmed in@@ de@@ cent accommodation for a in@@ let event in November 2009 .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs condemned the times between 15 and 21 hours a day , in an uni@@ form@@ ative cell , as in the sc@@ ru@@ in .
in the past few weeks , Berlin &apos;s pris@@ ons had come to head@@ lines for lack of staff .
det@@ ain@@ ees will therefore be kept back 23 hours , while the aggressive touch increases , there shall be a cl@@ amped position because of the cl@@ amped situation .
according to the Department of Justice , 21 positions in te@@ gel are not occupied because of a young defect , 19 are expected to fall out in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are creating &quot;
the immig@@ ration of refugees is a tremendous challenge - the ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or is decided to accept them .
what comes to Germany ?
according to forecasts of the Federal Ministry for Germany , about 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers are coming to Germany according to the predi@@ ction of Vice Chancellor , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , has even been able to record one million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) demonstrated in view of the unusual challenge determination : &quot; I say again and again : we can do this , and we do it . &quot;
what to get to Germany gives the following overview .
according to the different forecasts , more than 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Defense ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the Pest@@ el @-@ Institut ) are needed every year - and the next five years .
that is almost twice as much as it is built ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
dramatic is the lack of living space but especially in affordable accommodation units : annually , 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 social apartments come out of the rental price and in order to apply this particularly favourable apartments there are also refugees .
therefore , the Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding , of currently $ 518 million to one billion euros .
a lot too little is that of the pest@@ le Institute : 80 000 social apartments would have to arise each year and would have to invest a funding of 6.4 billion euros per year .
in addition , scientists and Federal Minister of the Federal Minister is that there must be more tax advantages for investing in housing construction .
according to the Institute of Employment Research and Professional Research , it is estimated that 55 per cent of the fle@@ dged @-@ employed people will be employed in Germany .
however , the refugees in Germany would not be asked for their qualification to help them with their introduction , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann @-@ Stiftung .
but the integration of refugees is crucial whether they are working in Germany .
work is the key to social contacts , for the appreci@@ ation in the admission company , but also for the self @-@ est@@ e@@ em of immig@@ rants , says migrants to Dietrich Thr@@ Ã¤n@@ hardt .
according to Thr@@ dis@@ hardt , there has been a political turn@@ around in Germany : from the Labour Convention for Refu@@ ge@@ es for Rec@@ ogn@@ ition of Work .
whereas there was no working date for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the resi@@ den@@ ces , the asylum seek@@ ers are limited to a residential place .
in society , it also has led to the visual impact of visual acuity , and in particular , that refugees and access to the labour market should be made possible .
a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are missing German .
until now there is no sufficient supply to general and work @-@ related language courses .
research shows that jobs are being convey@@ ed most frequently due to personal contacts .
the structure of network drives is therefore view to the view of Thr@@ ones of the KÃ¶nigs@@ weg to the integration process .
the Berlin School administration has found that only few fle@@ dged parents have their children to the Kit@@ as , estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the parents &quot; parents , it is only once important to meet the family , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ en@@ bar , spokes@@ person for youth and family in the Berlin Senate department .
nevertheless , around the family , they were able to convince the advantages of the K@@ ita in order to make public bal@@ lot in different languages .
if the need of educ@@ ators to climb significantly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - roughly , by nar@@ rower more specialised schools .
students without a German courses are prepared for tuition in different countries in the countries .
they are not always taught by teachers and teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have one qualification in German as a second language .
in them there is no lack , says Be@@ ate Govern@@ or from Berlin &apos;s school administration .
the German student union estimates that around 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany .
princip@@ ally taught no German land for asylum seek@@ ers or in commem@@ oration of the study : the only exception was that Berlin , the Minister of the Interior Frank Henkel ( CDU ) now has abandoned his attitude now .
Study periods of refugees could be facilit@@ ated by the University of Applied Sciences .
for refugees with a resident permit or Dul@@ ce , no services after the asylum seek@@ ers have entered the right after the asylum seek@@ ers .
the latter is generally no b@@ af@@ Ã¶@@ g , as they don &apos;t fall under the circle of the pe@@ af@@ ous persons .
Ged@@ ul@@ ant refugees have to have lived for four years in Germany to be eligible to participate in B@@ af@@ Ã¶@@ g @-@ laws , from 1 January 2016 , this span will be shortened to 15 months .
also this financing gap must be closed , calling Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin@@ s State Secretary for Science , and the German Student Union .
the students should get an@@ af@@ o@@ y immediately .
in future , Islam will play a key role , as many refugees are Muslims , and many are the religion important part of its identity .
the state should see Islam succ@@ essi@@ vely the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing State churches of churches will continue to develop a new state of religi@@ ons .
it is important to be the formation of a Islamic prosper@@ ity association which takes care profession@@ ally in new@@ com@@ ers .
the rights belong also to the rights .
so , the representatives of Islam must agree to clear the contact persons and to work with the state in many areas and to set certain control options .
this is also part of the read@@ iness to prevent the formation of religious proc@@ alism .
the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ zy@@ ek , expressed concern on Thursday , religious conflicts could also be registered in Germany too .
those who wanted to cont@@ end such conflicts in Germany , &quot; have immediately got their right to stay here in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ ro@@ ischer Rundfunk .
he suggested to transl@@ ate the Basic Law on Arabic .
today , integration will be much more than now a theme of the entire company .
thus , the majority society has to change , the degra@@ dation of discrimination and rac@@ ism is ur@@ ged .
Germany - as a result of European decisions - a anti @-@ discrimination law and a general Equality Act .
but it was very slow playing the NSU @-@ series , where the police and authorities were systematically ignore the rac@@ ist motif .
same chances for all : what mig@@ rated organisations and the advoc@@ acy groups of NGOs commit to a long time and to what international agreement will be committed to reality in the coming years if the country will remain peace@@ fully and their new citizens should use their opportunities - for benefit of all .
generally , Germany is able to supply pre @-@ sufficient refugees to be medi@@ cally cared for , by means of medical doctor Frank Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what Man@@ - Power and Capacities are concerning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the day level . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must flow into the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ gom@@ ery is required to accept all cont@@ ests on the registration of health care .
the services could be anticipated later by the federal states in later .
and long @-@ term , it was highly un@@ question@@ able so many people with the limited power catalog sent away that the asylum seek@@ est .
otherwise make the doctors before all the language barri@@ ers .
so far so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de proved to be demonstrated , migrants are sexually transmitted over their diseases as other patients .
not only in the clinics , even in medical practices , interpre@@ ting charges have to be acquired .
many refugees ch@@ ai@@ ded in the emergency @-@ ambul@@ ances during many patients also have been helped by many refugees .
and with another diagnostic look .
under refugee children , there are much more un@@ treated sex , and the young people go round about HIV @-@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment .
with these partly other diseases , German doctors from her education , however , Mont@@ gom@@ ery Village is considered to be obvious .
&quot; paras@@ ite di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea or tuber@@ culosis are not so hard to know . &quot; and what the state of the doctors have been concerned , even by the refugees , even len@@ ders are sometimes left in sight .
the Syrians had a highly advanced image system , and some refugees are even doctors .
in order to make practic@@ ing practic@@ ing , however , they would have to re@@ ject its qualification and allow to re@@ im@@ itate their tests .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany is mentally ill according to the Federal psycho@@ therap@@ ist ( B@@ Pt@@ K ) , most of them suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress testing or depression .
particularly against refugee children , Dietrich Mun@@ z says , president of the B@@ Pt@@ K .
a recently published study of the TU MÃ¼nchen , in fact that every fifth Syrian refugee crisis is trau@@ mat@@ ised in Germany .
those who have an post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder is suffering , suffering from the so @-@ called Flash@@ back , breathing , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart @-@ rab@@ bit and f@@ atal@@ ities .
other symptoms are sleeping and concentration functions , strong rest and emotional di@@ vin@@ ity .
to prevent the symptoms were chronic , an early treatment would be necessary , Mun@@ z declared .
however , only four percent of psych@@ ologically ill refugees have a psycho@@ therapy .
indeed psych@@ ologically ill @-@ looking asylum seek@@ ers can provide a request for psycho@@ therapy , but the processing usually takes several months .
in addition , in the com@@ post offices , individuals or doctors who are not trained for mental illness , decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often lead to failure , says Mun@@ z .

FC Arsenal &apos;s captain Mi@@ kel Art@@ eta says that te@@ amm@@ ate must stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
W@@ enger has stressed opposite Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is only September and if its rehabilitation system runs , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play before Christmas again .
this optim@@ istic scenario means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is sure to miss out at least the next four games for England , and in view of its history , his participation in the next summer is certainly un@@ certain .
the great dis@@ grace of this present problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate fl@@ aw@@ ing injury , and then returned to its old weak@@ ening during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury does not rebu@@ kes the career , &quot; said W@@ enger .
it is a bone that was not well healed .
this is no greater matter .
that was just an accident .
it was not in combination with his Kn@@ u@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries that he had before .
it may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as W@@ enger , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it has also been an in@@ agre@@ eable sample .
the study of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 out of Ar@@ sen@@ als 157 Lig@@ as@@ ps in the last five times .
the larger image of ar@@ senal is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six out of eight play@@ times since 2007 / 08 with the most influ@@ ential days .
closely accepts the potential of a devil &apos;s group , but Arsenal believed that there will be an improvement in the injuries rate during the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , if you return from injury , you have a vulner@@ able period , a time in which you must strengthen your body and attack power , &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
jack is young enough to overcome it .
I hope that his body stabil@@ izes , I am confident that he will do it and he will soon run a career of this kind which he deser@@ ves .
Arsenal begins its Champions League @-@ season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb before play against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham &apos;s hot@@ track on Wednesday , and W@@ enger represents a rotation in the team .
Bell@@ er@@ Ã­n and Aaron Ram@@ sey does not have travelled to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ieu Deb@@ uch@@ y and Art@@ eta want to start .
W@@ enger can also start with the Gib@@ bs Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I try to keep balance and the players who need to take a little tru@@ ce , &quot; said W@@ enger .
although Arsenal are continued to go down by Group F , Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the playing sites with the largest in@@ ti@@ ary effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is beaten up after 41 games after the &quot; unbe@@ atable &quot; campaign in the last season has started .
the stadium was sh@@ aken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , where measured on the Richter scale 3.2 .
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
W@@ enger is the opinion that Arsenal has drawn the doctrine from last season with the Champions League captain against Monaco and remains committed by fer@@ rous hope to lead the association with his first European ok@@ al triumph .
&quot; this drive is immen@@ sely , &quot; said W@@ enger .
it has never been folded for Arsenal .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I am long enough in the store to be realistic .
we are ambitious but we are not a dre@@ amer .
friendship Concert : the com@@ edy show that grants us serious lessons over male friend
the absence of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , especially regarding the need for men to open up , now even more des@@ per@@ ate than ever before , such as the sel@@ ections among young men have proven on a 15 @-@ year pro@@ s .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and there are three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Campa@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ isk ( CA@@ LM @-@ Campa@@ ign against a inher@@ ent life ) 2015 was the year of man to ask the goal of seeking the culture of question if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the fighting in order to master this challenge .
a recent study in more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with de@@ press@@ intensive symptoms revealed that whenever the suff@@ erer has a sufficient high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood &quot; having doubled its opportunities to enjoy@@ ment .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of intellectual friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have once more friends , so that your friendship can work .
in the age of social media , communication with its focus on substance makes the in@@ fertil@@ ity of response often more important than an important contact .
our digital life have the need to be strong , fun and successful , doubled , even when in reality the isolation is domin@@ ating .
this super@@ ficial success is dominated by the fact that psych@@ ologist ex@@ tr@@ ins@@ ic values call ; money , image , social status , all at cost in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner vis@@ ages looking for personal development and friendship which affects our spiritual health much deeper than .
and like a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire particularly stated , money can really not buy luck .
the beauty of friends was that this focus was set on the head .
each character has not been defined by his work , but by his personality who sh@@ ined through the interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler frequent h@@ ugs , moments in football ring in cozy bo@@ ilers and the lon@@ ging of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can refer to any case , even if they often fall back , complete their feelings .
as a employee of the telephone past@@ oral care told me : ... &quot; my au@@ dien@@ ces for people who are de@@ pressed and self @-@ end@@ anger@@ ed , showed me really clearly , how even the smallest inter@@ actions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often feel not able to talk with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old spe@@ ech@@ es &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come to agree with an enormous effect , like the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness of people , if one speaks about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to me in the meaning when I try to offer long @-@ term maint@@ ainer mechanisms .
it show@@ cases very clearly the little moments of defects .
so very much objective of out@@ sider side@@ band over the telephone to people in sight look even , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you &apos;re going to visit this weekend of com@@ edy Central Friend@@ ship with the celebration of the day completely redesigned setting , why do not take your friends at a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better if you would like to see in Star@@ bu@@ cks anyone alone , give him a smile and tell him hello .
one never knows what the difference your friendship could do .
friends will be broadcast on com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the entire 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ feast
to help Maria G to assist the PS@@ G in MalmÃ¶
angel Di Maria is celebrating with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hits on MalmÃ¶ .
in his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to move to MalmÃ¶ .
here are the playing report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Mur@@ ani , considered Paris Saint @-@ Germain his Champions League Cup season with a very comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against MalmÃ¶ in the Prin@@ zen@@ park stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League Deb@@ ug@@ ger as PS@@ G player , who brought the French champion in the way , but afterwards she missed a number of occasions before finally increased their advantage than Cav@@ ani in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Sch@@ acht@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in the group A takes Paris a strong start against the Swedish Master , since it is not only the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ rounds , but an improvement on the path to the quarter final in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , there was no classification of Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Z@@ lat@@ an Ibra@@ him@@ ov@@ ics missed opportunity in play against his home town team and against the club , which he started out his lively career back in 1999 .
&quot; it is not easy to win back home or to the Champions League . hence , it &apos;s a good start , 2 : 0 to create and look back to our opponents , even if there are certain things we have to be perfect in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; this is a good sign .
we wanted to win and we won , although I am sorry we didn &apos;t have one or two further goals . &quot;
Ibra@@ him@@ ovic was returned to the Paris team following his violation of three changes to Paris @-@ Team on the weekend . but he was able to hold its own place against Bordeaux in the first league , but it was cast out by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argentin@@ ean flug@@ el@@ stor@@ ms was referred to as the man who was taken over to the next stage in Europe when he st@@ owed in the last month of Manchester United when he moved to Marco Ver@@ r@@ att@@ is Pass behind the MalmÃ¶ Defense , before returning to Johan Wil@@ and passed away nicely in the long corner of the network .
but if som@@ eb@@ ody believed that PS@@ G would generate a big win , it was disappointed .
MalmÃ¶ , the Cel@@ tic in a play @-@ off hit to get this stage , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine National Games on the field and was excited with a Five @-@ man Defense and two deep in the middle field , a severe opponent .
but apart from a shot by Nikola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who settled far to Kevin Tra@@ pps &apos;s post in the 3@@ 4th minute , they grab@@ bed little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G himself gave himself sometimes , with some mis@@ mis@@ siles and bad ending , not least by Ibra@@ him@@ ovic , who was sh@@ ielded in less than five trials in the first half and then abandoned after the re@@ boot of Cav@@ ani .
still , he pointed out much more skill when he brought his players in the game , and it was a pass from Ibra@@ him@@ ovic to the Di Maria in a shot that was directed by Wil@@ t at the post of the 5@@ 2nd minute ...
the second gate was finally shortly after the hour mark due to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans thus scored his six main season , after he had a left flan@@ k by Max@@ well .
this finished all thoughts that MalmÃ¶ can return to the game , and only an excellent intervention made from Wil@@ t to stop David Lu@@ iz , was able to keep the end result very low before the elim@@ ination of E@@ ze@@ qui@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi could have been recognized a goal at the end .
the coach of MalmÃ¶ , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , gave later that PS@@ G played a class over his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last December last year .
since then , we have played only in the Swedish league , which did not have the same level .
the quali@@ fications are not sufficient . &quot;
hat from Paris !
it was a great game of them !

Brown did sho@@ cked , with heavy un@@ belief and called &quot; HO@@ O ! Wow . &quot; okay , &quot; as the comments of the actor from The Mar@@ ti@@ an was established .
in Dam@@ on and Brown , the production @-@ sized Ben Tre@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers came to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to invite people to think about it - who will always be the director - how to treat the figure of the Harmony &quot; as she said .

Detroit Tig@@ ers p@@ ses the course of Minnesota Twin@@ s
MIN@@ NE@@ WS L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of season was not very funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once they were one of the best teams in Bas@@ eball . today the tiger &apos;s eye stand on the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as Sp@@ o@@ iler , but this part played perfect against the Minnesota Twin@@ s with 5 @-@ 4 in the target Field .
the Twin@@ s spent a chance for ascent in a playing half of the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card @-@ Platz .
for Detroit , if only for an evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word , which was difficult to deal with a great part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all victories have fun , no matter what it comes , &quot; says Tig@@ ers manager Brad al@@ m .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon kept his early offensive support when Detroit stayed three times in the first two nings , then once in the sixth and then once again in ninth place .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) smote the last six times in the 1 / 3 In@@ nings and resulted in three gifts .
it was only his third successful start in his final nine games .
&quot; I want to finish this year , &quot; said Simon .
it is hard to throw the bul@@ l@@ do@@ z@@ ers of any game , so I want to easily go to the game .
the designated Tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and stayed in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits at Seattle n@@ aval battle on July 6th .
&quot; he has shot up well . &quot; he said , &quot; He said .
he looked good at the ( drums ) , saw clearly better from the bul@@ l@@ do@@ z@@ ers , and he brought it directly to the game .
with three R@@ uns at the rear end of the seventh In@@ nings , Twin@@ s had their best chance to come back into the game again .
center F@@ iel@@ der Byron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left of the field .
Right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks was a colorful , and Simon brought his second bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before it was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ins Hard@@ y .
Hard@@ y passed the wall , the only man faced with whom he was con@@ fron@@ ted , in front of the designated ro@@ ok@@ ie star@@ mann Miguel S@@ ano who had a Two @-@ Run entr@@ iss .
with a pair of runners and the completion Run in the second , dis@@ comfort the Third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe on a Double play .

however , the rectangle with three pit@@ ches of 3 pit@@ ches for the fifth time .
Detroit benef@@ ited from the start of the game by an even not movable Phil Hug@@ hes .
the tig@@ ers achieved three mut@@ ations in the first two nings against the battle of the Veter@@ an , who was kn@@ itted before the game by the injuries of the injuries , after spending more than a month .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wish for myself , &quot; said Hug@@ hes , &quot; but I felt happ@@ ier as I started and felt that I would get some good pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
after winning the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ B@@ atter in the first time , H@@ ush@@ es got a single second to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ ger .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z in the game who made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z abolished his 0 @-@ 21 successful series with the runners in the Scor@@ ing position .
the third winner , Nick Castell@@ anos , followed with a single at the right side , was eliminated in another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he was trying to enter the third threat .
the tig@@ ers used in the second row , achieved a one @-@ out Double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; it was a big blow , &quot; said Pri@@ s manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he did not feel good , but he did the right job .
Hug@@ hes was found in a pitch @-@ count and had no points in the third inning , before being replaced by the Rel@@ i@@ ever rectangle A.@@ J.@@ A@@ gar .
Hug@@ hes arrived up with four hits and a walk with four Stri@@ ke@@ outs at Hug@@ hes .
remarks : tiger R@@ HP An@@ i@@ bal S@@ Ã¡n@@ chez is due to a violation of the roots .
he was investigated by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the shoulder of San@@ chez in 2007 .

Isch@@ inger : military action in Syria an option
the leader of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German involvement in Syria for a possibility .

Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
nearly 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome .
in the presence of the town president Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino has been christ@@ ened on Wednesday an un@@ locked place in the park on the Opp@@ io @-@ Hill in the name of the German reform@@ ators .
at the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now honoured as the German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park lies in the middle of the ancient Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was filed by the work of the evangel@@ ical churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , priest of the Evangelical Lutheran congregation in Rome , rec@@ alled that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es were able to live for centuries only in secret their faith .
this square is visible in a symbolic way that the tradition of Christian faith in Rome are welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) stayed as young August@@ in@@ ian mon@@ k at the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 for a few months in Rome .
he received the city at that time as a commented stay .
his negative impressions have encouraged him in view to the history of hist@@ ori@@ ans in his future struggle against Rome .
Luther then had led the split of the exp@@ ul@@ tural church with his thes@@ es against the abstra@@ cts of the canc@@ eled church .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) Dor@@ n@@ enk@@ rone is one of the leading works that Ot@@ mar Alt has painted over his bi@@ ble .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has updated the introduction and Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible that has appeared with magnificent pictures .
at the beginning was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , who has formulated his very personal interpre@@ tations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 mot@@ ives .
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but by no means of this with &quot; funny &quot; images .
on the contrary : the particular topics are adjusted , that can be quite dark .
for around three years , Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his bi@@ ble project for which he has made a sub@@ jective artistic choice from the many theme areas of &quot; Book of all books . &quot;
there are cycles that dev@@ ote topics such as way of cross@@ roads , pl@@ agues , and pat@@ ern@@ ity .
this gives me spontan@@ e@@ ously as many partners : this is true of Luther &apos;s publishing house with his the@@ ological alignment , as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its emphasis on synthetic books .
and this is especially the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who placed himself on the basis of painting with the particular quot@@ ations .
he interpreted the bi@@ ble Bible comm@@ enting the bi@@ ans and translated into current cont@@ ex@@ ts today . &quot;
these texts are like verb@@ al mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
nestled between the original biblical vote of Martin Luther and one sentence of the artist , who sum@@ med up his very personal thoughts on its situation here .
the piece of jewelry has golden Let@@ ters .
the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
that is a high level of in@@ tim@@ acy .
emotions were ultimately born in general trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 in Wer@@ n@@ ig@@ er@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict protest@@ ant Herr@@ n@@ hu@@ ter @-@ Order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was an educ@@ ator with the stock floor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to work that , in order to bear me again with the Lord &apos;s father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second suit was to help art the art in faster time : &quot; the perception of image wel@@ ds is still min@@ ted today by Rek@@ lame , and this is no@@ isy .
Sym@@ bo@@ lik will be displac@@ ed .
artists have a desire and delight to show things .
pictures have always something secret and are not decorative .
&quot; in this regard , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt wants to leave the viewer into the images &quot; to finish it , discover and feel that power they have : &quot; the image will be on his counter@@ part . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ host rock on Tuesday at the presentation of Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; has always been &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art : &quot; I like he under@@ stands with his pictures . &quot;
I don &apos;t know that the Bible says it is complete , but those who are important for him , also mysterious topics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was not a co @-@ operation at eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is how the pictures depic@@ ts the text that explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this work is an invitation to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his life &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ Ã¶hler of Luther &apos;s publishing house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for M@@ Ã¶hler both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
a piece of original paper and linen pictures - will be shown for the first time in an exhibition which opens on 15 November at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this year even more visible happens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
without &quot; further &quot; break &quot; it should be started with the work of former indoor swimming pool .
DF@@ B intensi@@ fied commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B is expanding its commitment to refugees until 2019 , the Bundesliga marked a significant sign on the weekend .
the football re@@ acts on the moving situation in Germany and ensures policy helps with the help of the prosec@@ uting problems .
&quot; I think that for the biggest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; there can no man say , &quot; nobody can talk to me , &quot; I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has to be interested in every individual , this topic in the handle &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said DF@@ B chief of Wolfgang ren@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he will intensi@@ vely enhance the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; I am next Wednesday at the German Chancellor and meet the State Minister , J@@ o@@ Ä@@ u@@ z and the Chancellor . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic is certainly a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the soccer could help and help .
but the decisive turn@@ outs is to put the policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football Federation has therefore expanded its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by four years &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have ensured that this programme runs until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Dra@@ s@@ bach on the edge of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also some of the LÃ¤nder support this program .
already on this weekend the 36 pro@@ fi@@ ver@@ ly transl@@ ates a clear sign when it on the left tri@@ cot instead of the usual Spon@@ sor@@ ption name ( Hermes ) will help raise the task &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; welcome .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everybody should help , wherever and how they can only do , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Le@@ verk@@ usen Sport@@ ly Rud@@ i VÃ¶l@@ ler took the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; image &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) , and called the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; refugee drama is going on , no one can see . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can no , no , we must use our jet power , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who already have so incredibly successful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha manager Michael Pre@@ etz &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Managing Director of Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent symbols of the league . &quot;
for the EM @-@ quali@@ fier against Hungary this Friday the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Saale .
ren@@ bach inst@@ al@@ izes the support of refugees as &quot; a large joint venture of German football . &quot;
that all 36 license numbers have started in their own projects , be great .
it is just as great that small and smallest clubs are active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have been spent in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is of enormous importance , &quot; he said .
in this and next year the association comes together with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government for 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees .
&quot; the clubs have already called for 2015 , &quot; related kidney failure . &quot;
reports : SAP @-@ President loses one eye
chief Executive Board of Europe &apos;s biggest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , report@@ edly lost the left eye through a crash in early July .
following the accident at the stairs in the house of his brother in the USA , he fell to a water@@ bed after midnight , which he carried in the left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost f@@ aded , and has got away out of sex on the street - this he told us last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ IW@@ O &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SAP @-@ co @-@ founder Has@@ el@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could follow his work .
&quot; at the beginning of October , we meet with the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Plat@@ ner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full work &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; SÃ¼d@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , where he will return to Germany in October and further to the software group .
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course I had all time in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chair@@ person Has@@ well sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t changes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer time he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
it is important to let him go to the public with such a personal history , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said : &quot; everyone can pass something . &quot;
&quot; it is important to get up , if you like it . &quot;

football : Bv@@ B without Re@@ us against Kras@@ no@@ dar : fran@@ kin@@ f@@ eller in the gate
in Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback in the first group game of the Europa League will finally be broken .
the national player is missing to the table leader of the soccer league , also in du@@ el with the F@@ RP Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.00 clock / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , we cannot stop him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el said on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether Re@@ us will be on Sunday in the Bundesliga match against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the Bv@@ B coach is open : &quot; we expect a return from him into the training on Friday . &quot;
due to the high burden of its professionals , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its core position on the re@@ us position .
so he announced a change to the door@@ ke@@ over position .
therefore Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of the tri@@ p@@ art@@ ender Roman BÃ¼r@@ ki .
&quot; he trained at an absolute top level , &quot; the football @-@ teacher praised the World Champion .
either as Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the future is used in all Europe league games , Tu@@ ch@@ el left but open .
with high probability , it will also contest the second game .
the for@@ ges statement by Mit@@ zer Re@@ us that the final entry for the Bv@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal that holds Middle @-@ field from Julian W@@ eig@@ l : &quot; that Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; I think we have a good chance to re@@ mot@@ ely access the title . &quot;
Ro@@ bot &apos;s cars : government wants to become a pione@@ ering role for Germany
in Germany , according to the will of the Federal Government , Germany will be upon change of the vehicle technology predecessor .
the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which set to further investment in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
he lec@@ tured on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the Motor Show IAA from a &quot; new Mobility Age &quot; system .
the automated and networked drive will increase the traffic safety and provide for less st@@ out , said Do@@ brin@@ dt .
he plans to discuss the subject also with his counter@@ part from the G7 states which come together with industry representatives at the IAA .
the strategic partner of the Ministry of Transport , among others , emphas@@ ises the importance of the mobile broad@@ band expansion and a smooth running on digital radio stations .
for testing new technology , a test track is currently taking place on motorway 9 in Bavaria .
in order to prevent the driver &quot; no additional adhes@@ ion risk provis@@ ion@@ ing , &quot; the Federal Government wants to verify the legal conditions , and where necessary to adapt the new developments . &quot;
for example , Germany wants to employ roughly internationally as the permissible speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is increased from 10 to 130 km / h .
in addition , the Federal Government plans to apply for an amendment to the Vienna Convention , which so far only man sees people as a driver .
when automated driving takes over , the car is increasing the lead , the driver becomes more and more passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that process the environment and process data in seconds .
after a study by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving can be technically possible on motor@@ ways by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , driving vehicles on public roads are likely to be expected &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until 2020 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value creation in the area of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at the German site estimate the authors of the study by 2025 at about 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the cars can contribute to more safety and efficiency in traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SPD com@@ post@@ ist S@@ Ã¶r@@ en Bart@@ ol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the question of liability incur@@ red in cases and safety of personal data of the driver must be clari@@ fied in clear .
however , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are sk@@ ep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
one on Wednesday at the AA specified survey of the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the test organization D@@ EK@@ RA emerg@@ es that only eight percent of Germans believe that self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are going through over the next 10 years , 32 percent would not believe in 20 years so , 31 percent believe not at all .
in France , 21 percent of those surveyed by 2025 with autonomous driving cars , accounting for 33 percent in the US .
anyway , drivers in Germany are not willing to rely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
according to a collection of the B@@ IT@@ KO@@ M , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire trip on all roads .
on the highway , traffic may well imagine 15 percent of floating transport , in St@@ au 45 percent .
good anyone would leave the car under no circumstances .

&quot; &quot; &quot; he was his reply , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , an exhibition for me had a little after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you die , one gets to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously made in the Canadian Montreal and Paris Station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is how much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s to tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the scar@@ cely evident piece of man who has written fashion history without ever having completed an apprentic@@ eship .
chron@@ ologically , the look is not built , but it is an excellent , chore@@ ograph@@ ed overall art work , for which much effort has been operated : to replace the d@@ olls , this example was a styl@@ ist .
14 tons of materials have joined the makers according to the cur@@ ator of Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
just before the start of the Okto@@ ber@@ fest@@ es there was another special shot : a leather p@@ ants out@@ fit with Kor@@ s@@ ett .
Madonna di meets Madonna .
he is still interested in strong women ( &quot; women are severe than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , &quot; said Gaul@@ tier .
also Gaul@@ t@@ ers old Teddy is also visible in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , peaceful fashi@@ onable studies of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he used to listen to his Teddy B@@ HS and dresses , she said .
with a doll to play , his parents were not allowed to him .
but the emp@@ t@@ oss of fashion did he bring to himself later .
he became fashion collections and saw the designs of other designers , such as Gaul@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought this but of course .
for his first fashion show he didn &apos;t pay the models .
they got nothing , but were allowed to cl@@ ashed the cl@@ ots .
jewelry taking place Gard@@ on - Pl@@ au@@ er tip as Fashion
previously , it went to the long nit@@ sk@@ y machines and around pl@@ um therefore , meters to make .
the best material and peaks were produced in large amounts for customers that , for example , to cover ceilings and curtains .
and that alone does not work anymore by Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of fashion shows .
instead , fashion is important again .
in the beginning of the Pl@@ au@@ ener top , fashion played a major role played by the home textiles industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt announces some examples : tip in jewelry , accessories such as pockets and for regional trains .
at all , the so @-@ called Vintage fashion , which re@@ jects the previous sty@@ li@@ stic sense , they have increasing the potential .
those who have been operating in the textile branch in Germany is no more than the market .
we are already making half of all the orders already .
fashion shows Pl@@ aces together with nine other companies member of the industry association Pl@@ au@@ ener top and der@@ ies .
only they are allowed to bear the protected label .
in the last 15 years , roughly 80 percent of sales have been broken .
private shops and retail businesses are almost no longer available .
our products are barely serv@@ iced by our customers on this way .
nowadays the mass market is far less expensive nowadays in the Asian region and almost exclusively distributed over chains .
additionally , export , currently to Russia and the United States are weak@@ ened .
there are enough reasons for new ways .
the industry association also tries to meet environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer of the embroi@@ der@@ y in Fal@@ ken@@ stein : &quot; since that year we have a quality seal , which shows that we produce ecological and soci@@ ally . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt compl@@ ements : &quot; it also refers to the materials used . &quot;
graduate designer U@@ te Schmidt has taught at the University of Applied Arts in Z@@ wick@@ au , Germany , at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and special@@ izes in embroi@@ der@@ ies and tips .
in order to meet the competition from Asian region , it needs to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
there is a voltage field between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and companies that must think particularly economically above all , &quot; says Schmidt .
that is why a existing building is often only slightly varied to keep a customer base .
a few years ago , textile design@@ ate Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter re@@ developed the historical snow @-@ top system .
the machine suff@@ oc@@ ates little cows on some places .
the pl@@ au@@ lin gold master of Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ lt left to inspiration : &quot; before that , I could nothing start with traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener . &quot;
now they use the snow @-@ spi@@ ke for their jewelry .
in a complex procedure , she has shaped the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people of the region identify themselves with the subject of pl@@ au@@ lin - young and old , &quot; says Reu@@ ter .
she also supplies the USA , after Australia and Finland - especially to customers who lived in pl@@ um and around the area and want to recall a memor@@ abil@@ piece .
with that , I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador for pl@@ au@@ lin back .

EU intends to double mercury limit value in rough fishing
the European Commission wants to double the limit values of mercury in large @-@ scale fishing and consumers a clearly higher dose of the nerve food .
the consumer organization F@@ ood@@ watch , which lies a corresponding working paper of the EU , critic@@ ised the plans sharp : &quot; risks and side effects associated with full balance to pregnant and to@@ dd@@ lers , &quot; stated Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , F@@ ood@@ watch .
it is said to estimate the limit values of the Ner@@ ven@@ gi@@ f@@ tes to large fish at the end of the food chain , like about Hai@@ - or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish from &quot; economic policy reasons &quot; from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram of fish .
large @-@ fish @-@ fish are already so strong with mercury , already on the basis of the limit values not allowed to be sold around 50 per cent of the length .
after dou@@ bling the limit values then only 14.5 percent would be refused .
in contrast to this attrac@@ ting the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limits with other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram .
F@@ ood@@ watch , however , called the &quot; Tri@@ ck , &quot; because smaller gra@@ y@@ fish are as low as though they are so low that they already hold the planned maximum values already today .
the ab@@ dic@@ tory at Kl@@ einf@@ isch is therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ ction of de@@ fle@@ ction , that helps the economy alone , &quot; stated Wolf@@ sch@@ midt .
mercury is a high @-@ grade heavy metal that strongly stim@@ ulates the food chain in particular in the food chain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore warned that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even small amounts of damage can cause the damage to the nerve damage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Ministry of Environment explained in its homepage with regard to the highest peak values , however , that a &quot; health concern of the general population &quot; is not expected to be expected .
mercury was found especially by the burning of coal combustion into the environment .
according to a written information from the Federal Ministry of Environment to the Green Coun@@ sel , Ann@@ alena Ba@@ er@@ bo@@ ck ordered more than six tons of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total amount issued in Germany em@@ itted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fishes , along the river Rhine , Rhine and Danube is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanent and widespread cover , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had quoted the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Der Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March of the paper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the af@@ ore@@ mentioned risks of mercury in fish already contains the most common health risk of health haz@@ ards in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
