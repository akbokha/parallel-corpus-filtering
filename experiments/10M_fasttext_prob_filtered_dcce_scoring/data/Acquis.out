&quot; in recognition of the fact that the pot@@ ism and the export of Ham@@ mel is important and Lam@@ b@@ ail@@ ments after the world market and especially after the community for the New Apostolic economy exist@@ ent - and Lamb meat on these markets cannot be affected , hon@@ our@@ ing myself to propose the following agreements : &quot;
&quot; the agreement is valid for : - fresh or cooled Ham@@ mel - , Lamb - and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ; &quot;
&quot; after this agreement , New Zealand will be ensured for Ham@@ mel - , Lamb - and goat meat of access to the market of the Community in the agreement . &quot;
&quot; in New Zealand , the assur@@ ances , that the normal paragraph of his ham@@ let - and the Lamb is not being drawn through the application of regulation in compassion . &quot;
&quot; to ensure a f@@ law@@ less functioning of the agreement , ple@@ dged to New Zealand , by appropriate procedures that the fact did not exp@@ ire the set crowd . &quot;
the pre@@ standing amounts are executed in conventional supply forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
&quot; the community in@@ sured that New Zealand should not be prevented from this agreement , to use new technological developments or to maintain its competitive position on the market of community . &quot;
&quot; should a change of the supply form as a result of changes in technology and trade are possible , so consult the two parties before introducing such a change in terms of cl@@ ause 10 mentioned below to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
