&quot; the present document is a summary of the European Public Pro@@ pos@@ al report ( EP@@ AR ) , in which explains how the committee is assessed for human phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) , in order to get to recommendations concerning the application of pharmaceuticals . &quot;
&quot; if you need further information about your disease or treatment , please read the packaging unit ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information regarding the recommendations of the CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of tablets , than 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg melt ( 1 mg / ml ) and as injection @-@ solution ( 7,5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. wir@@ res , and Speech , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or vision of things that are not present ) , Mis@@ str@@ ust and ins@@ ets ; • Bi@@ polar disorder , in which the patients receive man@@ ic episodes ( periods of normal peak ) alter@@ nat@@ ely with periods of normal mood . &quot;
A@@ bili@@ fy is used for treatment of medium to severe Man@@ ic episodes and to the prevention of man@@ ic episodes of patients who have addressed the medicines used in the past .
injection @-@ solution is used for fast control of improved un@@ rest or behavi@@ oral disorders when the or@@ ale intake of drugs is not possible .
&quot; for both diseases , the solution for inser@@ ting or melt t@@ aps in patients may be applied to which the gor@@ ges of tablets were difficulty . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients , who are taking other medicines that can be found exactly like A@@ bili@@ fy , the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy should be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; this affects the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter , &quot; i.e. chemical substances , which allow communication of the ner@@ ve cells among each other . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ kl@@ z@@ ol probably acts especially as a particip@@ atory ag@@ ony for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ try@@ pt@@ amine ( also ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ kl@@ z@@ ol such as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ try@@ pt@@ amine and ling@@ erie , but in executed dimensions when the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter works to enable the recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; da D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ try@@ pt@@ amin in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia , and bi@@ polar disorder carries a role to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , causing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy , the re@@ ation of the symptoms were prevented , was examined in three studies over up to one year . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of injection @-@ solution was compared in two studies at 8@@ 05 patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or similar diseases which compared to increased un@@ rest , compared to a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study A@@ bili@@ fy over twelve weeks of 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ oper@@ i@@ do@@ l , in another study , the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo that were re @-@ occur to 160 patients in which the man@@ ic symptoms were already stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy injection @-@ solution was made in a study of 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which suffered on increased un@@ rest , with which of Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , the change in symptoms of patients based on a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who were examined on the treatment . &quot;
the company also conducted studies in order to examine how the body mel@@ ting the mel@@ ting tab@@ let@@ ts and the solution for inser@@ ting res@@ or@@ ted .
&quot; in the two studies with the injection solution showed patients , the A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5,@@ 25 mg , 75 mg or 15 mg , a significant increase in symptoms of improved un@@ rest than the patients that received a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; when applying for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy in four of the five short @-@ time studies are more effective than plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; A@@ bili@@ fy prevented more effectively up to 74 weeks , more effective than plac@@ ebo the re@@ occur man@@ ic episodes for previously treated patients and if it was in addition to an existing treatment . &quot;
A@@ bili@@ fy @-@ inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses decreased also more effective than plac@@ ebo the symptoms of improved un@@ rest and were similarly effective like Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy to take ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extr@@ ap@@ yr@@ am@@ id@@ ale ( c@@ low@@ ness ) , v@@ esti@@ bu@@ ck ( c@@ low@@ ness ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion ( increased s@@ ali@@ zer ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia , and anxiety . &quot;
the committee for humanity ten@@ ants ( CH@@ MP ) had to conclude that the benefits of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who predomin@@ antly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes to treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ kl@@ z@@ ol An@@ ders to ou@@ tw@@ ei@@ gh the risks .
&quot; in addition , the Committee came to the outcome that the benefits of injection effects in patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or patients with man@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia , or in patients with man@@ ic episodes at Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if a oral therapy is not suitable , compared to the risks . &quot;
June 2004 divided the European Commission of the Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceu@@ tical Europe Ltd . a permit for the transport of A@@ bili@@ fy in the entire European Union .
&quot; AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y is for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of the Bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients , the predomin@@ antly man@@ ic episodes had and their man@@ ic episodes to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ kl@@ z@@ ol An@@ ders ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day with an adult dose of 15 mg / day once daily independently of meals .
a improved efficiency with dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven though individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
&quot; the recommended starting dose for AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and Bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group should be considered a lower initiation dose , if clinical factors justi@@ fy this ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ indu@@ ction consists of the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ kl@@ z@@ ol dosage should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the appearance of su@@ izi@@ al behaviour belongs to mental illness and aff@@ ective disorders , and was reported in some cases after beginning or after a change of anti@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ kl@@ z@@ ol ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the results of epidem@@ i@@ ological study showed that it had no increase in patients with bi@@ polar disorder , with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol compared to other anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs . &quot;
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol should be used with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ din@@ ary diseases , conditions , responsible for hyp@@ ot@@ onie , hy@@ po@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with ble@@ eding drugs ) or hyper@@ ton@@ ia ( including ak@@ zel@@ er@@ ated and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies , which resulted in a year or less di@@ gesti@@ ble , there were occa@@ sional reports on treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol to Dy@@ du@@ in@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; if you occur with AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y patients suffering and symptoms of a sp@@ ig@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ arity , should be considered to reduce the dose or to break the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient signs and symptoms developed on a m@@ ns , or un@@ clear high fe@@ ver without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all Anti@@ psych@@ otic medicines , including AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ kl@@ z@@ ol should be used in patients with cor@@ amp@@ fan@@ cases in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese or at states who are with caution in connection with caution . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in patients with psych@@ osis who have been associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who have been treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in comparison to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; however , there was in one of these studies , a study with Fi@@ xer Dos@@ age , a significant relationship between the dosage and cont@@ acting of unwanted events in with Ari@@ pi@@ kl@@ z@@ ol treated patients . &quot;
&quot; Hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with K@@ eto@@ azi@@ osis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ary comp@@ a or death , was reported in patients who were treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti @-@ otic agents , including AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y . &quot;
there are no precise risk assessment of hyper@@ gl@@ y@@ a@@ emia related inci@@ dental events treated with AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y and other at@@ yp@@ ical agents treated patients to allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , Poly@@ ur@@ ie , Poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in relation to a deteri@@ oration of gl@@ uc@@ ose levels . &quot;
&quot; a weight increase will generally be observed in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia , and in patients with bi@@ polar Man@@ y , the application of anti@@ psych@@ otic medicines , the use of anti@@ psych@@ otic medicines which is known as a side @-@ effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle , and could lead to severe complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ kl@@ z@@ ol on the Central nervous system , caution is offered if Ari@@ pi@@ kl@@ z@@ ol is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective drugs with itself over@@ se@@ ated side effects such as nau@@ sea ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 @-@ Ant@@ agonist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ in , a gast@@ ric acid @-@ blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , whereby this effect is not relevant as clin@@ ically . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with healthy volunteers boo@@ sted a highly effective CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) the AU@@ C by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol by 107 % , while the C@@ max remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that other highly effective inhi@@ bit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as cur@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , similar effects have and therefore should be made similar dosage reduction . &quot;
&quot; at CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) met@@ abolic diseases , the common application can result with high efficient in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors from CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma cent@@ ri@@ ations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol compared to CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sible met@@ abolic path@@ ians . &quot;
&quot; if one draws the common gift from K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or other highly effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors with AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y , the potential benefits should prevail the potential risks for patients . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhi@@ bit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ol and HIV @-@ Prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ bit@@ ors , could have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dosage reduction . &quot;
after bottling the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors should be lifted up the dosage of AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y on the dos@@ ing levels prior to the start of the accompanying therapy .
Dil@@ an@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y will be admini@@ stered together with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - Con@@ centr@@ ations .
in clinical studies shown doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ kl@@ z@@ ol per day no significant effect on the metabolism of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ Metho@@ x@@ ym@@ orph@@ an @-@ ratio ) , 2C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ kl@@ z@@ ol ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) . &quot;
the patient should be advised to notify her doctor if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
&quot; due to the insufficient data base for safety when people and due to the animal studies at animal studies , this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy unless the potential utility justi@@ fies clearly the potential risk for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; but also with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ika the patients should be war@@ ned , dangerous machines , including strength vehicles , to operate , until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ kl@@ z@@ ol has no negative influence . &quot;
the following side effects appear more frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) on than at plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : often ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia - In a controlled long @-@ term study conducted over 52 weeks , treated with Ari@@ pi@@ on@@ z@@ ol , a total of lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ ins@@ on@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ is@@ ie , D@@ yst@@ onie and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ ology , compared to patients who were treated with Hal@@ oper@@ i@@ do@@ l ( 57@@ ,@@ 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol treatment and 13.5 % in patients under plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients who have been treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and 15.0 % in patients with O@@ lan@@ zap@@ per therapy . &quot;
Man@@ ic episodes at Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 23.@@ 5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ kl@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 53.@@ 3 % in patients under Hal@@ oper@@ i@@ do@@ l treatment .
&quot; in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under li@@ thium treatment . &quot;
in the long @-@ term survey of 26 weeks at a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pr@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for plac@@ ebo patients .
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and plac@@ ebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ in@@ vari@@ ably controlled lab parameters , yiel@@ ded not medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; enh@@ ancements of the CP@@ K ( Kre@@ atin @-@ Ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporarily and asym@@ pt@@ om@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of the patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ kl@@ z@@ ol patients compared to 2,@@ 0 % of the patients treated with plac@@ ebo patients . &quot;
&quot; among the side effects that can occur in connection with an anti @-@ mental therapy , and about their occurrence also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ kl@@ z@@ ol , Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ tox@@ ic events and increased mort@@ ality in elderly dem@@ entia patients , hyper@@ gl@@ y@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
in clinical trials and since the market launch were un@@ int@@ enti@@ onal or int@@ int@@ ak@@ y over@@ do@@ ings with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol only observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death suc@@ cession .
&quot; although there are no information on the effectiveness of a hem@@ is@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of a do@@ z@@ zation with Ari@@ pi@@ kl@@ z@@ ol ; however , it is un@@ likely that Hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of a over@@ dose of use is , as Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is a high plasma cutting . &quot;
it is assumed that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ol in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and Bi@@ polar @-@ I have a combination of a particip@@ atory effect on D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and Ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on Ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ ors .
Ari@@ pi@@ kl@@ z@@ ol showed a high Aff@@ in@@ arity to the D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 @-@ recept@@ or and the Ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - for alpha @-@ 1 @-@ rep@@ lica and hi@@ stam@@ ine @-@ H@@ 1@@ Reci@@ or .
&quot; at the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ kl@@ z@@ ol in Do@@ si@@ ers from 0,5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks of healthy pro@@ pul@@ den showed the Pos@@ itr@@ ite @-@ E@@ missions tom@@ ography , an D2 / D@@ 3 recept@@ or Lig@@ urian , at nucle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and on the cou@@ name . &quot;
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1.@@ 228 z@@ op@@ hr@@ ined patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol compared to plac@@ ebo a statis@@ tically significant increase of mental symptoms .
&quot; in a Hal@@ oper@@ i@@ do@@ l @-@ controlled study was found in week 52 of the proportion of respon@@ sive patients who were talking to the study , in both groups similar ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol 77 % and Hal@@ oper@@ i@@ do@@ l 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values made of measurement units , which were defined as secondary studies , including PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - De@@ pres@@ sion@@ rates @-@ scale , showed a significant stronger improvement than in Hal@@ oper@@ i@@ do@@ l . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks to stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia , showed a significantly higher reduction in the return rate , which was at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol group and at 57 % under plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ per @-@ controlled , multination@@ als with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia over 26 weeks , the 314 patients surrounded by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( N = 18 or 13 % of the pay@@ able patient sets ) at least 7 % compared to the output value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg at an average weight of approx . 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dos@@ ing over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ kl@@ z@@ ol showed a superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks . &quot;
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol to plac@@ ebo no superior effectiveness .
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo@@ - and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ kl@@ z@@ ol showed an exce@@ eded plac@@ ebo superior effectiveness in week 3 and one adult effect , which was comparable with that of li@@ thium or Hal@@ oper@@ i@@ do@@ l in week 12 . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ kl@@ z@@ ol also pointed out in week 12 a compar@@ ative proportion of patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic re@@ mission of the Man@@ y on how li@@ thium or Hal@@ oper@@ i@@ do@@ l .
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics which are partly over 2 weeks not on Li@@ thi@@ um@@ - or Val@@ pro@@ at @-@ mon@@ otherapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol a superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms associated with li@@ thium or Val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ time expansion phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients , Ari@@ pi@@ kl@@ z@@ ol compared to plac@@ ebo with regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar back@@ drop , predomin@@ antly in preventing a return to the Man@@ ie . &quot;
&quot; based on vit@@ ro @-@ studies are the enzym@@ es CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 for de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydr@@ ation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol responsible , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ fication is cataly@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
the mean elimination of half @-@ half period is roughly 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in exten@@ sible met@@ abolic path@@ ology on CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and at approximate 146 hours with &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ ism via CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; in Ari@@ pi@@ kl@@ z@@ ol , there are no differences in the phar@@ ma @-@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy prob@@ es , equally exhibited in a pharmac@@ ological investigation of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia patients no gender @-@ dependent effects . &quot;
a popularity @-@ specific analysis of the Phar@@ mak@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics has no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to ethnic affili@@ ation or the impact of the room on the phar@@ ma @-@ mak@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
the pharmac@@ ological characteristics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol were similar in patients with severe kid@@ ney in@@ suff@@ ers in comparison to young healthy volunteers .
&quot; a single dose study by Pro@@ ban@@ den with di@@ eng@@ th@@ osis liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the imp@@ air@@ ment of the liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of the class C , which does not sufficient to pull slots on their met@@ abolic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on security met@@ ering , tox@@ icity , tox@@ icity , reproduction , gen@@ oto@@ x@@ icity , and to the can@@ cer@@ ous potential , the pre@@ clinical data gave no special dangers to the human being . &quot;
&quot; Tox@@ ic@@ ological effects have been observed only with dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions which exce@@ eded the maximum dosage or ex@@ position in humans , so that they have only limited or no meaning for clinical use . &quot;
the effects embr@@ aced a dos@@ ing @-@ dependent side @-@ tox@@ icity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin accumulation of accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ alties among men ) and an increase of adren@@ aline p@@ onder@@ s at 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10@@ fold of the Middle Ste@@ ady @-@ State @-@ Ex@@ position ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose for humans ) .

&quot; the effectiveness of Abra@@ x@@ ane has been studied in a major study , in which 460 women had received with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters of earlier an an@@ thr@@ ac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine . &quot;
the effect of abra@@ x@@ ane ( in all@@ some gift and as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the one conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs by means of ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce unwanted effects ) .
&quot; overall speaking in the main study of 72 ( 31 % ) of 229 with Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ treated patients on treatment , opposite 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 Pati@@ ents , including the conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained drugs . &quot;
&quot; one only considers the patients who have been treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , in terms of drug indicators such as time to deteri@@ oration of the disease and survival , no distinction between pharmaceuticals . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , it was evident from patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer in terms of these indicators that Abra@@ x@@ ane is more effective than conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained drugs . &quot;
&quot; it must also be used not for patients who have breast@@ feeding , or before the start of the treatment of low ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ ods in the blood . &quot;
&quot; the committee for Human@@ arz@@ ten@@ ants ( CH@@ MP ) presented that Abra@@ x@@ ane has not exce@@ eds the initial treatment , more effective than conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained medicines has to be given in contrast to other Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs , to reduce unwanted effects . &quot;
January 2008 passed the European Commission to the company Abra@@ xis Bi@@ osc@@ ience Limited a permit for the transport of abra@@ si@@ ane in the entire European Union .
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is inde@@ xed for the treatment of metastatic mam@@ mac@@ ar@@ cin@@ oma in patients , in which the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease is broken and is not shown by a standard thr@@ thr@@ ac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine treatment ( see also section 4.4 ) . &quot;
in case of patients with severe Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ y ( Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ du@@ en@@ ings &lt; 0.2 x 109 / l over a period of a week or longer ) or severe sensor@@ ath@@ ic neuro@@ ath@@ ie during the abra@@ sive therapy the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 .
&quot; for sens@@ ory Neurop@@ ath@@ y degrees 3 is the treatment to interru@@ pt , until a recovery is achieved at level 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles must be reduced the dose . &quot;
there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with mild to moderate imp@@ air@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .

&quot; if an allergic reaction occur , the drug should be initiated immediately and an sympt@@ om@@ atic treatment can be initiated and the patient should not be treated again with Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; in patients should not renew , abra@@ si@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated up to the ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ du@@ en@@ ings once again &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l , and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ ten@@ ers is back to &gt; 100 x 109 / l . &quot;
patients with heavy liver dys@@ functions ( B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; while a un@@ ambiguous with abra@@ sive tox@@ icity was not proven , kar@@ di@@ al inci@@ dents are not unusual , especially in patients with earlier an@@ thr@@ ac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine treatment or underlying cardi@@ ac disease or lung disease . &quot;

abra@@ si@@ ane can cause unwanted side effects such as fatigue ( very common ) and s@@ win@@ ches ( common ) which can affect the traffic noise and the ability to serve machines .
&quot; below are the most common and important inci@@ dents listed by side effects , which appeared in 229 patients with metastatic Mam@@ mak@@ ar@@ cin@@ oma study , which were treated with 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane once every three weeks . &quot;
Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie was the most striking important hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ( at 79 % of the patients ) and was quickly re@@ versi@@ bly and dos@@ ed ; Leu@@ cop@@ en@@ ie was reported at 71 % of the patients .
An@@ emia ( HB &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed at 46 % of patients treated with abra@@ sive patients and was severe in three cases ( HB &lt; 8 g / dl ) .

&quot; this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed of a biological medicine is similar that is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) , which contains the same substance ( also &quot; &quot; references &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in patients with normal blood controls , in which may occur in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion complications in case before the procedure is an own blood circulation , and where a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected . &quot;
treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases which has shown the medicine .
&quot; in patients with kid@@ ney problems and in patients who want to make a self @-@ blood flow , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a V@@ ene . &quot;

it is produced by a cell that was brought into a gene ( DNA ) that she is engaged in the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared to administration as an injection into a v@@ ene within the frame of a main study with 479 patients suffering caused by kid@@ ney problems caused by kid@@ ney problems .
&quot; all patients participating in this study was spent at least eight weeks in E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a v@@ ene , before they were either received on se@@ ag@@ amed or continue to received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
main indic@@ ative for the effectiveness was the change of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the account period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
&quot; in addition , the company set out the results of a study , in which the effects of among the skin calls for those who were examined by E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in the study involving patients suffering caused by kid@@ ney problems caused by kid@@ ney problems , the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ational values of patients who were planted on se@@ ag@@ amed as with those patients who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , patients who continue to received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , an increase of 0,@@ 0@@ 63 g / dl of the output value of 12,@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common side @-@ effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is a rise in blood pressure , which occasionally lead to symptoms of a encephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , kno@@ wled@@ geable he@@ ada@@ ches and conf@@ ess can lead . &quot;
Ab@@ se@@ amed must not be used in patients that may possibly be hy@@ pers@@ ensi@@ tive ( allergic ) against epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other components .
&quot; se@@ ag@@ amed as an injection among the skin is not recommended for treatment of kid@@ ney problems , since further studies are required to ensure that this is caused by no allergic reactions . &quot;
&quot; the committee for humanity ten@@ ants ( CH@@ MP ) had to conclude that for se@@ al@@ amed was performed in accordance with the provisions of the European Union of proof that the drug has been a comparable quality , security and active profile , such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;

&quot; if the HB increase is bigger than 2 g / dl ( 1,25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) a month or a HB value of 13 g / dl ( 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must minim@@ ize the risk for possible thro@@ pods ( see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chem@@ otherap@@ ie@@ conditioned An@@ emia - Dos@@ ing with the aim of keeping the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ance between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) . &quot;
&quot; the decision for applying bl@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit risk reduction under the participation of each patient , which should also be considered in the specific clinical context . &quot;
&quot; if patients who are intended for a larger electrical orthop@@ edi@@ c procedure , if possible , before starting the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy the cause of ana@@ emia is examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; patients who educate yourself to a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ edi@@ c intervention , as they should maintain an adequate Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ se@@ proph@@ yla@@ xis , since they have increased risk to thro@@ pods and v@@ ascular diseases , especially with an underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it cannot be excluded that in treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an initial hand value of &gt; 13 g / dl an increased risk for post@@ operative thro@@ pods / v@@ ascular events can exist . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled studies , for epo@@ et@@ ine did not proven that they can improve the overall survival with sympt@@ om@@ atic An@@ emia , or reduce the risk of tum@@ or pro@@ gression . &quot;

&quot; if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ ine should be controlled and the Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ ori@@ osis should be adapted to the increasing hem@@ at@@ ok@@ rit . &quot;
&quot; in vit@@ ro @-@ investigations on tum@@ ours , there are no evidence on an inter@@ play between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ C@@ SF or GM @-@ C@@ SF regarding domestic differenti@@ ation or pro@@ lifer@@ ation . &quot;

the most common side @-@ effect during the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is an dos@@ ing @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the deteri@@ oration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
an increased incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ vas@@ cul@@ ular events ( see section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General ) was observed in patients under treatment with er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ inen .

&quot; there is an increased risk for th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ic events in tum@@ ours patients , which can be treated with re@@ combined human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin , and a negative effect on the overall survive cannot be excluded . &quot;
&quot; it is not clear how far these results are treated on the application of re@@ combin@@ able human@@ istic er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin in tum@@ ours , which can be achieved with chemotherapy under 13 g / dl , because a few patients were included with these characteristics in the veri@@ fied data . &quot;

A@@ cl@@ asta is used for treating the following diseases : • oste@@ opor@@ osis ( an illness which makes the bones spr@@ ö@@ de ) both for women after men@@ op@@ ause and men .
&quot; it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( bone break@@ through@@ s ) , including in patients who suffered a little traum@@ atic hip , such as the hin@@ ge of the bone , a disease , which changed the normal course of the bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with mor@@ bus Pag@@ et should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip joint dose should be a great dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or by injection into a muscle . &quot;

&quot; for the treatment of mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , A@@ cl@@ asta should be prescribed by doctors , who have experience in treating this disease . &quot;
&quot; since the active ingre@@ dient in A@@ cl@@ asta is like in Zom@@ eta , a part of the data material for Zom@@ eta was attracted to the evaluation of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; during the first study , nearly 8 000 older women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and it was investig@@ ating the number of spine and hip frac@@ tures over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; the second study embr@@ aced 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , which recently suffered a hip re@@ frac@@ ture ; it was examined the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years . &quot;
&quot; with Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , A@@ cl@@ asta was tested in two studies at a total of 357 patients and compared six months with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ at ) . &quot;
main indi@@ ct@@ ator for the effectiveness was whether the sal@@ ary of al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in the Ser@@ um ( an enz@@ y@@ m which re@@ construct the bone substance ) in the blood or at least 75 % compared to the starting point .
&quot; in the study with older women , the risk of spine actually was under A@@ cl@@ asta ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) over a period of three years compared to the patients suffering from plac@@ ebo by 70 % . &quot;
&quot; compared to all patients under A@@ cl@@ asta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) with those under plac@@ ebo , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % . &quot;
&quot; in the study with men and women with hip , 9 % of the patients under A@@ cl@@ asta a Fr@@ ac@@ upuncture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the patients under plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) . &quot;
most side effects of A@@ cl@@ asta are within the first three days after inf@@ usion and are less frequent with recovered inf@@ usions .
A@@ cl@@ asta should not be used in patients that may possibly be hy@@ pers@@ ensi@@ tive ( allergic ) against Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ ates or any of the other components .
&quot; as for all bis@@ phosph@@ ates , patients are subject to patients with A@@ cl@@ asta risk of kid@@ ney , reactions from the inf@@ usion site and O@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( die of bone tissue ) in the ja@@ ws . &quot;

&quot; after a treatment of mor@@ bus Pag@@ et with A@@ cl@@ asta , a long re@@ is@@ sion period was observed in patients who raised the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to treat patients with mor@@ bus Pag@@ et a sufficient supply of calcium , respectively twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients with a recent low @-@ traum@@ atic hip , an initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis of 50@@ ,000 to 12@@ 5.000 , i.e. , or in@@ tra @-@ mus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first A@@ cl@@ asta inf@@ usion . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of symptoms which occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ asta , can be reduced by G@@ abe of acet@@ amin@@ op@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after application of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
patients with kid@@ ney diseases ( see Section 4.4 ) In case of patients with an Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min . A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended as limited clinical experience for these patients .
&quot; older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dosage adjustment is not necessary since the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients . &quot;
&quot; children and young people A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended for use in children and young people under 18 years , since data are missing and effectiveness . &quot;
A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended in patients with severe kid@@ ney in@@ suff@@ iciency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) as for this patient @-@ population only limited clinical experience .
an existing Hy@@ po@@ kal@@ ine is before the start of therapy with A@@ cl@@ asta due to sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; because of the quick introduction of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone structure can develop a temporary , mit@@ om@@ atic hy@@ po@@ kal@@ ine , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta occurs ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to treat patients with mor@@ bus Pag@@ et a sufficient supply of calcium , respectively twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;

&quot; for patients , the dental implants are not available , there are no data available , whether the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ ates are reduced to the risk of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses in the max@@ im range . &quot;
the clinical evaluation by the patient doctor should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and are based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
&quot; frequency of symptoms which occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ asta , can be reduced by G@@ abe of acet@@ amin@@ op@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after application of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the incidence of as serious side @-@ effect reported cases of fore@@ hoff@@ li@@ mm@@ ers was in patients who received A@@ cl@@ asta , increased ( 1,@@ 3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients , the plac@@ ebo ( 0,@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 852 ) . &quot;
in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , HO@@ RI@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fr@@ ac@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) was the total frequency of fore@@ hoff@@ ic between A@@ cl@@ asta ( 2,@@ 6 % ) and plac@@ ebo ( 2.2 % ) . &quot;

ren@@ al functioning Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid has been expressed as acceptance of the kid@@ ney function ( d. h. an increase in the ser@@ um creation ) and in rare cases as ak@@ able kid@@ ney failure .
the variation of the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ( annually in front of the administration and a complete ren@@ al function were compared in a clinical study among oste@@ opor@@ osis about three years comparable to between the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase in the Ser@@ um Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of gift has been treated at 1.8 % of patients with A@@ cl@@ asta @-@ treated patients compared to 0.3 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo patients .
&quot; based on the evaluation of lab findings , the temporarily asym@@ pt@@ om@@ atic Kal@@ c@@ um values , which are under the normal oscill@@ ation area ( less than Amaz@@ m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , in 2,@@ 3 % of the patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta in the mor@@ bus p@@ ago@@ et @-@ study @-@ treated patients . &quot;
&quot; all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study for the prevention of clinical fr@@ ac@@ tures , according to a hip fl@@ ac@@ upuncture and in the mor@@ bus p@@ ago@@ et studies ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study for the avo@@ idance of clinical fr@@ ac@@ tures , after a recent cancellation hip , the vitamin D @-@ mirror were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , however , the majority of patients received an initi@@ al@@ osis vitamin D before administration of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions After administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a great clinical study was reported on local reactions to the inf@@ usion site , such as red@@ ness , sw@@ elling and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) . &quot;

clinical effectiveness in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The effectiveness and safety of A@@ cl@@ asta 5 mg once a yearly for 3 consecutive years was reported at post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women ( 7.@@ 7@@ 36 women at the age between 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone mineral steel ( BM@@ D ) or a BM@@ D @-@ T @-@ Score for the Sch@@ enk@@ ins as ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing sp@@ ell cell .
effects on morph@@ ometric identi@@ fier A@@ cl@@ asta has significantly significant over a period of three years and already after a year the incidence of one or more new vert@@ eb@@ ro@@ fr@@ tures ( see chart 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ asta @-@ treated patients from 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk for sp@@ inal cord compared to plac@@ ebo patients ( p &lt; 0.2 ) .
&quot; effects on hip re@@ frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ asta pointed out a constant effect over three years , which resulted in one of 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk for hip frac@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ asta increased the bone density on lum@@ bar treatment , hips and the dist@@ al radius compared to plac@@ ebo treatment significantly to all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;

the A@@ cl@@ asta treatment led over 24 months compared to plac@@ ebo therapy for a boost of the BM@@ D by 5.5 % at the total of 4.8 % at the total of 4.8 % .
clinical effic@@ acy in men In the HO@@ RI@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT @-@ study were rand@@ om@@ ized and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical fr@@ ac@@ tures was 7,5 % with a@@ cl@@ asta @-@ treated men compared to 8,@@ 7 % when plac@@ ebo . &quot;
in a different study in men ( study CZ@@ OL@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) was the once an annual administration of A@@ cl@@ asta compared to the last week of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ique compared to the percentage change of the Len@@ den@@ wir@@ bel @-@ BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the starting point .

11 The effectiveness of an inf@@ usion of 5 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in comparison with the intake of 30 mg Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at once daily during 2 months has been proven in two six months @-@ case studies .
the combined results was observed after 6 months a similar acceptance of pain and pain edge in comparison with the starting value for A@@ cl@@ asta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified as an Respon@@ si@@ bilities at the end of the six month &apos;s main study ( on the therapy addressed ) were able to be added in an after@@ observation phase .
&quot; from the 143 with A@@ cl@@ asta and the 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate patients who were able to participate in the post@@ observation study , compared with 71 of the patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at patients , compared with 71 of the after@@ observation phase of 18 months after application . &quot;
&quot; unique and multi@@ tudes 5 and 15 minutes continuous inf@@ usions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid at 64 patients erg@@ ent the following pharmac@@ ological data that proved to be dos@@ ed independent . &quot;
&quot; after that , the plasma fell quickly from at &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long lasting phase very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value . &quot;

&quot; the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above t ½ -@@ values ) represent the quick res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and the exp@@ iry of the kid@@ neys . &quot;
&quot; in the first 24 h , 39 ± 16 % of admini@@ stered dose in urine , while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; the overall body @-@ Clear@@ ance is independent of the dose 5,@@ 04 ± 2,5 l / h and remains un@@ influenced by gender , age , race or body weight . &quot;
an extension of the inf@@ usion period of 5 to 15 minutes led to the acceptance of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ age concentration by 30 % at the end of the inf@@ usion but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration at time ) .
a reduced Clear@@ ance of by Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 @-@ En@@ z@@ ym@@ ously met@@ alli@@ zed substances is un@@ likely because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not met@@ aboli@@ zed because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not met@@ aboli@@ zed because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not yet met@@ aboli@@ zed or no direct and / or irre@@ ver@@ sible @-@ dependent in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ -

&quot; summary of the EP@@ AR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Pub@@ lish@@ ers report ( EP@@ AR ) , in which explains how the Committee for Human@@ arz@@ pr@@ is has been assessed to recommendations pertaining to the application of pharmaceuticals . &quot;
Ac@@ tos is used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes ( also known as not ins@@ ul@@ in@@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) when Met@@ form@@ in ( a di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ medi@@ am@@ ament ) cannot be shown together with another di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ medi@@ cal@@ ament ( dual therapy ) .
&quot; it can be applied in addition to Met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , which can not be satisfac@@ tory with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ ated dose . &quot;
in combination with a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ant or ins@@ ulin can be kept the previous dosage of the sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ ri@@ stoff@@ s or ins@@ ulin at the start of the Ac@@ tos treatment ( lower blood sugar ) ; here should the dosage of the Sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ ri@@ stoff@@ s or ins@@ ulin can be reduced .
&quot; that means that the bodi@@ ly ins@@ ulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level , makes it possible to adjust type @-@ 2 diabetes . &quot;
&quot; with more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of Ac@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ y were examined ; they received patients a combination of met@@ forming with a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ ming , in addition they got up to 3,5 years either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ a hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) measured , which indicates how good the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which can conclude that the blood sugar levels have been reduced by 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ a study , the effect of the additional g@@ abe of Ac@@ tos to the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ant in lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0,@@ 94 % , while the additional gift of plac@@ ebo resulted in lowering the results . &quot;
&quot; in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and ins@@ ulin in 289 patients were examined , the patients , the Ac@@ tos in addition to ins@@ ulin measures , compared with 0,@@ 14 % in the patients that additionally took plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects in connection with Ac@@ tos were visual disorders , infections of the upper air@@ ways ( nar@@ rati@@ os ) , weight gain and hy@@ po@@ an@@ esth@@ esia ( decreased sensitivity to irrit@@ ation ) . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos must not be used in patients that may possibly be hy@@ pers@@ ensi@@ tive ( allergic ) compared to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or one of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , in@@ fertility or di@@ abe@@ tic K@@ eto@@ azi@@ er ( high level of ket@@ one - in the blood ) . &quot;
&quot; it was decided that Ac@@ tos in the framework of a mon@@ otherapy ( in the sole use ) as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ ering in patients should serve , in which met@@ formats is not shown . &quot;
October 2000 divided the European Commission of the Company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited a permit for the transport of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
&quot; the tablets are white to white , round , v@@ ault and wear on one side the mark@@ er &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; and on the other hand the wor@@ ding &quot; &quot; AC@@ TOS &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is also displayed for the combination with ins@@ ulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus whose blood sugar is in@@ adequate and in which met@@ forming is in@@ appropriate due to con@@ train@@ dic@@ ations or intoler@@ ance ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; for the use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are threatened by the presence at least one risk factor ( e.g. fruit cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or sympt@@ om@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should begin with the lowest available dose and increase the dose . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a her@@ ent suff@@ iciency , weight increasing or Ö@@ dem@@ e , particularly those with reduced car@@ dium reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a her@@ ent suff@@ iciency , weight gain and Ö@@ dem@@ e , when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is used in combination with ins@@ ulin . &quot;
a kar@@ di@@ ov@@ as@@ cul@@ ary Out@@ come study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre@@ existing advanced mak@@ eover disorder has been performed .
&quot; in this study , an increase in reports about the in@@ fertility effic@@ ien@@ cies showed that however , did not lead to an increase in the mor@@ ality in the study . &quot;
in patients with increased output enzym@@ atic enzym@@ atic ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the standardization ) or with other signs of a liver disease may not be used as Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on .
&quot; if the AL@@ T @-@ mirror are raised up to 3 @-@ fold of the upper limit of the standardization range , the liver enzym@@ es are to control again as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; if a patient symptoms are developed on a he@@ pati@@ c erectile dysfunction , such as un@@ resolved nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , fatigue , appeti@@ te , and / or dar@@ ker Har@@ n , are the liver enzym@@ es . &quot;
the decision whether the treatment of patients with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on should continue until the end of the laboratory parameters should be led by the clinical assessment .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has been a dos@@ ing @-@ dependent gaining weight and in some cases associated with a fluid marketing .
as a result of a hem@@ orrho@@ id under the therapy with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( relative reduction of 4 % ) and the hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction of 4,@@ 1 % ) . &quot;
similar changes have been observed in compar@@ ing controlled studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients with Met@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( relative reduction of the hem@@ mo@@ ist by 3.8 @-@ 4 % ) and a lower extent also in patients under sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ant and ins@@ ulin ( relative reduction of the hem@@ mo@@ ist by 1 @-@ 2 % and the hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased ins@@ ulin sensitivity , in patients , the Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on as or@@ ale two @-@ fold or triple combination therapy with ins@@ ulin therapy with ins@@ ulin delivery , the risk of dos@@ ing @-@ dependent Hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the launch was reported under the treatment with Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ Indi@@ ons , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , about a occurrence or deteri@@ oration of a di@@ abe@@ tic Mak@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ dem@@ s with a reduction of visual ac@@ u@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; it is un@@ clear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and the appearance of Mak@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ dem@@ s , though patients should be aware of the possibility of a Mak@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ dem@@ s , if patients should report about disorders of visual ac@@ u@@ ity ; a suitable oph@@ thal@@ mic declaration should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of reports of unwanted events regarding bone fr@@ ying out of rand@@ om@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blind trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on . &quot;
&quot; the fr@@ ac@@ upuncture was 1,@@ 9 Fr@@ ac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years with those with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on @-@ treated women and 1,@@ 1 Fr@@ ac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years with women who have been treated with a compar@@ ative drug . &quot;
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a study over 3.5 years to study car@@ di@@ ov@@ as@@ cul@@ ular events , occurred Fri@@ ak@@ tures on 44 / 870 ( 5,@@ 1 % ; 1,0 Fr@@ ac@@ tures per 100 patients ; 0.5 Fr@@ ac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years ) among patients who have been treated with a compar@@ ative drug . &quot;
&quot; the patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient is a pregnancy or this entry is to de@@ du@@ ce the treatment ( see Section 4.6 ) . &quot;
&quot; studies on the study of interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has no relevant effects on the phar@@ ma @-@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ od@@ ynam@@ ics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Phen@@ phen@@ cou@@ mon and Met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; interactions with pharmaceuticals , which met@@ aboli@@ zed by these enzym@@ es , e.g. or@@ ale @-@ contrac@@ ep@@ tiv@@ a , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium @-@ blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ ers are not expected . &quot;
simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Gem@@ fi@@ bro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) results in an increase in the AU@@ C by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on around the 3 @-@ fold .
simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C8 @-@ In@@ struct@@ or ) substantially in lowering the AU@@ C by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is attribut@@ able to that under treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on the hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ emia and increased ins@@ ulin resistance of the mother@@ hood and thereby reduce the availability of the met@@ abolic substr@@ ates for the fet@@ al growth .
&quot; very frequent &gt; 1 / 10 ; common &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , single cases : unknown ( from present data not estimated ) . &quot;
these lead to a temporary change in the tur@@ mo@@ or and the conne@@ ct@@ ation of the lens , as it can also be observed at other hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emic agents . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , AL@@ T stick@@ ers entered over the triple of the upper limit of the standard range , however , are rare as in compar@@ isons , under Met@@ form@@ in or Sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; in an out@@ come study in patients with pre @-@ existing advanced mak@@ eover , the incidence of a severe flo@@ ating suff@@ iciency is to 1.6 % higher than among plac@@ ebo if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on bz@@ v . &quot;
&quot; since the market launch has been reported most often above Her@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , however , if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was used in combination with ins@@ ulin or in patients with in@@ fertility suff@@ iciency in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; it became a summary analysis of reports of unwanted events regarding bone bro@@ ods , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gly@@ it@@ az@@ on treated groups and more than 7,@@ 400 patients in the groups treated with compar@@ isons . &quot;
&quot; over a period of 3.5 years of running pro@@ active study , Fri@@ ak@@ tures were treated with 44 / 870 ( 5,@@ 1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on @-@ treated patients , compared with 23 / 905 ( 2.5 % ) for patients treated with a compar@@ ative drug . &quot;
&quot; with taking the high dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days were no symptoms . &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on seems to work on a activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome pro@@ lifer@@ ator of rec@@ ept@@ or @-@ League ) ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ speaking ) ) which in the animal model leads to an increased ins@@ ulin tivity of liver , fat and sk@@ elet@@ al muscle cells . &quot;
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on enhances the gl@@ co@@ se@@ production in the liver and boo@@ sts the peri@@ pher@@ al transpl@@ ant in the event of ins@@ ulin resistance .
a clinical study involving Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d as Mon@@ otherapy has been continued for over two years to investigate the time until after@@ treatment of the therapeutic effects ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.4 % after the first 6 treatments .
&quot; at the time after two years after the start of treatment , a blood sugar could be defined ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8,@@ 0 % ) by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on at 69 % of the patients ( compared to 50 % of the patients under Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de ) . &quot;
&quot; in an plac@@ eb@@ ok@@ on@@ controlled study over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar has been in@@ adequate , despite three @-@ im@@ on@@ ati@@ cal optimization phase with ins@@ ulin in@@ adequate , to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; for patients suffering from Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , the middle H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c - value reduced by 0,@@ 45 % , compared to the patients that remains only ins@@ ulin ; a reduction of the ins@@ ulin crop in which was treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on @-@ treated group . &quot;
in clinical studies about one year showed herself at Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on at Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on per@@ tin@@ ent a statis@@ tically significant acceptance of the album in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Qu@@ ot@@ ien@@ ten compared to the starting points .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was examined in a small one on 18 weeks spent on type @-@ 2 di@@ abe@@ tics .
&quot; in most clinical studies were observed in comparison to plac@@ ebo a reduction of the plasma tri@@ gly@@ cer@@ ide and the free fatty acids and an increase in the HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as low , but clin@@ ically not significant increase in L@@ D@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies over a period of up to two years reduced pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on compared to plac@@ ebo , met@@ forming in or Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d the total plas@@ tic@@ ol gly@@ cer@@ ides , and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol levels . &quot;
&quot; compared to plac@@ ebo , under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was not statis@@ tically significant increase in the L@@ DL cholesterol levels , while in Met@@ form@@ in and Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d decreased values were observed . &quot;
&quot; in a study over 20 weeks of reduced pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on not only the so@@ ber tri@@ gly@@ cer@@ ide , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ cer@@ id mirror , this can be an effect on the tri@@ gly@@ cer@@ ide absorption and the he@@ pati@@ c tri@@ gly@@ cer@@ ide synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a kar@@ di@@ ov@@ as@@ cul@@ ular out@@ come study , 5@@ 238 patients were rand@@ om@@ ized with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mak@@ eover and pre @-@ existing advanced mak@@ eover therapy either pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; after or@@ aler application , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is rapidly res@@ or@@ ted , whereby the peak concentr@@ ations of un@@ altered Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in plasma can be reached 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV contributed to the effectiveness in roughly the triple of the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , but on the contrary , the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; in inter@@ action studies could be proven that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on the Phar@@ mak@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or Pharmac@@ od@@ ynam@@ ics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Phen@@ phen@@ cou@@ mon and Met@@ form@@ in . &quot;

&quot; according to or@@ aler application of radio@@ active marked Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in humans , the mark@@ er was mainly found in the fur ( 55 % ) and a lower extent in the har@@ n ( 45 % ) . &quot;
the average plasma @-@ elimination of the un@@ changing Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is at least 5 @-@ 6 hours and that of the entire active met@@ abolic ites lies at 16 - 23 hours .
the plastic centr@@ ations of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and its met@@ abolic disorders are lower in patients with reduced kid@@ ney function lower than in a healthy prob@@ es , whereby the spro@@ ckets of the or@@ chi@@ ve Clear@@ ance of the mother@@ boards are similar . &quot;

&quot; in the study , after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ ity hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) measured , which indicates how good the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane led to a acceptance of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mir@@ rors that pointed out that the blood sugar levels were similarly strong as with another human ins@@ ulin .
Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane should not be used in patients that may possibly be hy@@ pers@@ ensi@@ tive ( allergic ) to human ins@@ ulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
&quot; in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ an may be adjusted if it can affect blood sugar along with a number of other medicines which can affect blood sugar ( the full list is to be found on blood sugar ) . &quot;

&quot; if the switch to Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ an is required when the patient is a dosage adjustment , this may be necessary for the first dos@@ ing or in the first weeks or months after switching . &quot;
&quot; some patients , where hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emic reactions came to a change from animal in human ins@@ ulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of a hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia reported less pronoun@@ ced or otherwise than in their previous ins@@ ulin . &quot;
&quot; travelling that go over several time zones , the patient should be pointed to the Council of his doctor , since such trips can lead to that ins@@ ulin and meals must be applied or taken at other times . &quot;

&quot; if the ur@@ inary decre@@ ases after two to four weeks is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ ite , the dose may be increased to 120 mg once daily . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment of treatment , the patients may appear at least during the first six months under treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic even further medicines for the prevention of genes . &quot;
&quot; the medicine is not recommended for children and in patients who had an organ transpl@@ ant because it was not examined for these groups .
&quot; in the first study , on the 1 0@@ 72 patients , the effectiveness triple from various aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) with which of a plac@@ ebo ( hy@@ cri@@ tic drug ) and by Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( other medicines for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ik@@ emia ) . &quot;
in the second study two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) one year compared to 762 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
&quot; in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used at a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kid@@ ney problems received only 100 mg per day . &quot;
&quot; main inde@@ b@@ ator for the effectiveness was the number of patients , their ur@@ inary teles@@ cope in the blood during the last three measurements under 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of the patients , the Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of the patients who have once daily 120 mg in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , this was at 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of the patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in any of the 134 patients under plac@@ ebo the case . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are he@@ ada@@ ches , di@@ ar@@ rhe@@ a , nau@@ sea and normal living . &quot;
&quot; in particular in patients with cor@@ rid@@ ors in the pre@@ history , there may also be a raised risk of certain side effects which affect the heart and the blood vessels . &quot;
the committee for humanity ten@@ ants ( CH@@ MP ) had to conclude that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in the lowering of the ur@@ inary teles@@ cope in the blood but also a higher risk of side effects in connection with the heart and blood vessels .

&quot; as with other har@@ ming drugs , it can come during the treatment start to an ac@@ ute gr@@ ass@@ ination , because by lowering of the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ urses first of the ur@@ inary tract in the tissues can be mobil@@ ised . &quot;

clinical studies results The effectiveness of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C was described in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and fact study as described ) which were conducted with 1.8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ik@@ emia and Gi@@ ves .
the primary ingre@@ dient point was in every study the proportion of patients in which the last three month of Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ urses &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) were .
&quot; plac@@ ebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 134 ) or Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol to study course of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2,@@ 0 mg / dl . &quot;
the AP@@ EX study showed under 6 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) ( see chart 2 and figure 1 ) which is statis@@ tically significant su@@ peri@@ ority both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily opposite the treatment with conventional doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the fact @-@ study pointed with regard to the permanent lowering of the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ urses in 6 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) the statis@@ tically significant su@@ peri@@ ority both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to treatment with conventional dose Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

the lowering of the seren@@ ade to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was kept in the arz@@ t@@ Visit in week 2 and maintain permanently over the entire treatment .
509 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ um@@ incre@@ ine values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily . &quot;
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kid@@ ney @-@ functioning The AP@@ EX study has been rated the effectiveness of 40 patients with kid@@ ney @-@ functioning ent@@ angl@@ ement ( d. h ) .
with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C the primary effic@@ acy rate of 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) ; 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients achieved .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to the percentage of the seri@@ ousness of the seri@@ ousness of the seri@@ ousness ( 58 % in the group with conventional kid@@ ney function and 55 % in the group with heavy kid@@ ney fail@@ ures ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ s@@ ut@@ ations ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of the patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and fact @-@ study ) had been a Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
&quot; the data collected in two years showed that the permanent reduction of the seri@@ ousness of the phase 3 showed that less than 3 % of patients needed in the months 16 @-@ 24 treatment ( d. h. more than 97 % of patients required no treatment against a G@@ ich@@ tsch@@ ub ) . &quot;
&quot; this was also associated with a reduction in the coating dimensions , which had 54 % of patients a complete dis@@ appearance of the spine until month 24 . &quot;
&quot; increased T@@ SH@@ - Values ( &gt; 5,@@ 5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 5,@@ 0 % ) and also in patients , the Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5,@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ time extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
in healthy prob@@ abilities increased the maximum Plas@@ mac@@ on@@ zentr@@ ations ( C@@ max ) and the area under the Plas@@ mac@@ on@@ zentr@@ ation period @-@ curve ( AU@@ C ) from Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at after administration of sim@@ pler and multi@@ pl@@ ers doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ ed .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg is observed for Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at a rise in AU@@ C that is greater than dos@@ si@@ dis@@ proportion@@ ate rise .
&quot; after taking a simple or multi@@ pl@@ er cans of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily amounts to the C@@ max about 2,@@ 8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5,@@ 0 @-@ 5,@@ 3 µ@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change has been observed in the percentage of the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ urses in case that this has been checked ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The seem@@ ing Ste@@ ady state @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is located in the range from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
&quot; the plas@@ map@@ le connection from Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is about 99@@ ,@@ 2 % ( primary bond to Alb@@ um@@ in ) and is achieved through the concentration of concentration , which is achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg . &quot;

&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease , where the bones are br@@ ittle ) at women after men@@ op@@ ause in which a risk exists for a low vitamin D mirror . &quot;
&quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before meal , drink or deposits of other medicines ( including Ant@@ azi@@ da , calcium and Vit@@ amin@@ supplements ) . &quot;
&quot; to avoid a maturity of the es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient should not take up after the first food intake of the day , the early 30 minutes after taking the tablet is not down . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D@@ 3 are already separated from each other in pharmaceuticals , stored in the European Union , put the company data from previous studies and the published literature . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company also led a study with 35 men and 68@@ 2 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to prove the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE in terms of increasing vitamin D mir@@ rors . &quot;
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment the proportion of patients were treated with low vitamin D @-@ mirror in patients who were treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE , less ( 11 % ) than with those who took exclusively Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company also placed data that is contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE cards exactly the dose which is required to prevent a bone recovery . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are he@@ ada@@ ches , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ osk@@ elet@@ al ( muscles , bones , or joints ) and symptoms of the diges@@ tive apparatus , di@@ ar@@ orrho@@ ids ( di@@ aly@@ sis ) , ul@@ cers , dy@@ spher@@ ical ( ble@@ w ) , infl@@ ated ab@@ dom@@ en ( par@@ aly@@ ter stomach ) and su@@ res . &quot;
&quot; in patients with ket@@ able hy@@ pers@@ ensi@@ tivity ( all@@ ergy ) against Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other components may not be applied by AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE . &quot;
&quot; it must not be used in diseases of the es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with Hy@@ po@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( in low @-@ calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand up or sit down at least 30 minutes . &quot;
Janu@@ ary@@ 2007 passed the European Commission to the Company Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd . a permit for the transport of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE by the European Union .
&quot; capsule @-@ shaped , white to broken white tablets , marked with the layout of a bone on one side and &quot; 710 &quot; on the other side . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE is only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or inclusion of pharmaceuticals ( including Ant@@ azi@@ da , calcium and Vit@@ amin@@ supplements ) for the day . &quot;
the following notes are precisely to follow to reduce the risk of adequate irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
&quot; • AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE should be shot after the day of day only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patient should not leave the tablet or the tablet in the mouth , as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ ale Ul@@ zer@@ a . • The patient should not take place before the first food intake of the day , the early 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; B. pep@@ per@@ tic Ul@@ cus , active gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal ble@@ eding or surgical interventions in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal tract except P@@ yl@@ or@@ oplast@@ y , only under special care are given ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; eco @-@ policy reactions , such as i@@ soph@@ agi@@ tis , ös@@ oph@@ age@@ ale Ul@@ zer@@ a and ös@@ oph@@ age@@ ale ero@@ sion , rarely followed by ös@@ oph@@ age@@ al kn@@ itting , were reported in patients suffering from the intake of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( partially , these serious and required a Hosp@@ it@@ ance ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor should therefore look attentive to all signs and symptoms , which should refer to possible solution or retro@@ spec@@ al irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ spher@@ ical irrit@@ ation or new or sp@@ lim@@ mer@@ ing of so@@ d@@ burn the medicines and get medical advice ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 The risk of severe ös@@ oph@@ age@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or it according to the appearance of symptoms that refer to an ös@@ oph@@ age@@ al irrit@@ ation . &quot;
it is very important that all fe@@ eders could be passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .
&quot; while in large landscap@@ ed clinical studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was no increased risk , they were rarely ( after market launch ) gast@@ ro and Du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , including some serious and with complications , reported ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; O@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose of the p@@ amper , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including O@@ ste@@ om@@ yel@@ i@@ tis ) , was reported by cancer patients whose therap@@ ists contains predomin@@ antly in@@ trav@@ en@@ ously admini@@ stered bis@@ phosph@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; there are no data available to indicate whether the descent of a bis@@ phosph@@ atem@@ al@@ therapy in patients who need a sl@@ ate surgical procedure , reducing the risk of an oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose of the pine . &quot;
the clinical assessment by the treat@@ ment@@ ing doctor is binding for the therapy planning for each patient based on an individual benefits risk assessment .
patients should be dependent on taking the intake of taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE the tablet into the next morning after they noticed their om@@ is@@ tive .
&quot; they should not take two tablets on the same day , but taking the intake of one tablet per week as originally planned for the week@@ day . &quot;
other diseases that affect the mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D @-@ lack and mort@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ idi@@ cism ) should be treated before the start of therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE .
&quot; Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at food and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , Ant@@ azi@@ da and some or@@ ale medicines can imp@@ air the Res@@ or@@ ption of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at when they are taken at the same time . &quot;
therefore patients need to wait for at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
&quot; although specific transaction studies were not conducted , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken together with a variety of usually prescribed medicinal products , without the clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ depen@@ dencies . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE is intended only for application with post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and therefore is neither during pregnancy nor from nursing women .
animal studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at do not have a reference to direct impacts on the pregnancy that origin@@ ate the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
O@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose of the p@@ endant was reported in patients with Bis@@ phosph@@ ates ; most reports come from cancer patients but was also reported on oste@@ opor@@ osis .

in the two @-@ year extension of these studies the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D of vert@@ eb@@ ral column and tro@@ chan@@ ter continues to continue ; also the BM@@ D of Fem@@ ur@@ hal@@ ses and the entire body was maintained .
fit consi@@ sted of two pl@@ az@@ eb@@ ok@@ on@@ controlled studies at which al@@ end@@ ron@@ at daily ( 5 mg daily over 2 years and then 10 mg daily continue to be taken with either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study the daily g@@ abe made by Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at the appearance of at least a new vert@@ eb@@ row at 47 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 7.3 % compared to plac@@ ebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .

in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies was al@@ end@@ ron@@ at effectively if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drinking of the day .
&quot; at healthy Pro@@ ban@@ den , the gift from oral Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ on ( 20 mg three times daily over five days ) does not clin@@ ically significant change in bio@@ availability of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( increase in the average of 20 % to 44 % ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 distribution studies on rats have manifest@@ ed that al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate is divided for in@@ trav@@ en@@ visi@@ er gene for 1 mg / kg temporarily into soft parts , but then quickly spread in the bones , or with the urine . &quot;

&quot; characteristics of patients pre@@ clinical studies have shown that the proportion of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , who is not distr@@ acted in the bones , fast on the urine . &quot;

&quot; main indic@@ ative of the effectiveness was the number of patients , where the transpl@@ ant@@ at after a treatment duration of one year ( by example oppressed , how often a renewed organ@@ os@@ antation , or an recovery of di@@ aly@@ sis needed ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , more studies were carried out at 119 patients with kid@@ ney transpl@@ antation and 129 patients with liver transpl@@ ant and investigated such as Adv@@ ag@@ raf compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gr@@ aft from the body . &quot;

&quot; only doctors , who are familiar with the immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transpl@@ ant patients , should arrange this drug or make changes in the immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ res@@ sive therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of the system@@ ic ex@@ position of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m can lead this to tran@@ splan@@ ts or an increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or transi@@ tioning aggression . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; conver@@ sions of the formulation or the regime should only be made under the tight@@ ening control of one in the transpl@@ ant experienced physician ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; in a result of an alter@@ ation to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug surveillance and appropriate dosage adjustment has to be performed to ensure that the system@@ ic ex@@ position of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m has retained . &quot;
the dosage of Adv@@ ag@@ raf should be primarily based on the clinical evaluation of de@@ ple@@ tion and compatibility in the individual case and on blood levels . ( see below recommendations below )
&quot; after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ raf , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m levels should be controlled in front of the conversion and over two weeks after conversion . &quot;
&quot; on Day 4 was the system@@ ic Ex@@ position , measured as a talent , with both formulations , both in kid@@ ney and vibran@@ t patients comparable . &quot;
careful and re@@ peti@@ te controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Tal@@ mirror are recommended during the first two weeks after transpl@@ antation at Adv@@ ag@@ raf in order to ensure appropriate substance exposure in direct low @-@ transpl@@ ant phase .
&quot; because Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m is a substance with low Clear@@ ance , an adaptation of the Adv@@ ance Dos@@ age can last several days until the Ste@@ ady State is achieved . &quot;
if the condition of the patient is not allowed any or@@ ale intake of pharmaceuticals can be initiated by Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m treatment ( pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml con@@ cent@@ arte to produce an inf@@ usion solution ) with a dose of ca .
&quot; duration of the application on the supp@@ ression of transpl@@ antation must maintain the immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ies , therefore , therefore a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified . &quot;

&quot; further dos@@ ages may be required later , as the Phar@@ mak@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m can change in the course of stabil@@ isation of the patient after the transpl@@ antation . &quot;
dosage recommendations - liver transpl@@ ant proph@@ yla@@ xis of tran@@ splan@@ ts The or@@ ale Adv@@ ag@@ raf @-@ therapy should start with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift at the morning .
&quot; dosage adjustment - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ raf &apos;s must be a tran@@ splan@@ ts of prob@@ ag@@ raf capsules upon a daily intake of Adv@@ ag@@ raf , so this switch in relation to 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the entire daily dose . &quot;

&quot; hair tran@@ splan@@ tion For adult patients who are converted to Adv@@ ag@@ raf , is an oral initi@@ al@@ osis of 0,@@ 15 mg / kg / day daily . &quot;
other transpl@@ ant recept@@ ors are not a clinical experience involving in@@ ag@@ raf in lung , pan@@ cre@@ as@@ - and dar@@ n@@ tran@@ splan@@ ts patients in a or@@ tal initi@@ al@@ osis of 0.@@ 2 mg / kg / day and with intest@@ inal tran@@ splan@@ ts of 0.7 mg / kg / day to use . &quot;
dosage adjustment in special patient @-@ group patients with reduced liver function for maintaining blood tiles in the tight@@ ened area can be required in patients with heavy liver dys@@ functions a lowering of the dose .
&quot; patients with reduced kid@@ ney function , the kid@@ ney function has no influence on the phar@@ ma @-@ mak@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m , it can be understood that a dosage adjustment is not required . &quot;
&quot; due to the ne@@ phr@@ oto@@ x@@ ic potenti@@ als of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m , however , a careful monitoring of kid@@ ney function is recommended , including a regular determination of the ser@@ um@@ incre@@ ment in the calculation of creation and monitoring of the ur@@ inary system ) . &quot;
&quot; conversion from Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ to on Adv@@ ag@@ raf , when the conversion from a Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ ine to a Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m @-@ based therapy is advisable ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
recommendations for the Tal@@ ar in full blo@@ t The dose should be primarily based on the clinical evaluation of de@@ sto@@ ic and compatibility of whol@@ eness of full blo@@ t @-@ Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus talents .
&quot; it is recommended to perform frequent controls of tac@@ tical m levels during the first two weeks of transpl@@ antation , followed by periodi@@ c checks during the evening therapy . &quot;
&quot; the blood levels of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m should also change after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f on Adv@@ ag@@ raf , Dos@@ ing , changes to the immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in simultaneous application of substances , which may change the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m whol@@ eg@@ ran@@ ate ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since Adv@@ ag@@ raf &apos;s a medicine with a low Clear@@ ance , adjustments of the dose may need several days until the Ste@@ ady State has joined the Ste@@ ady State . &quot;
&quot; the data in clinical studies make it possible that a successful treatment is possible in most cases , if the talent in blood has not exceed 20 ml / ml . &quot;
in clinical practice the Tal@@ ks of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m usually lie in the first time after liver transpl@@ ant@@ ations usually in the area of 5 - 20 ng / ml and with tournaments - and heart@@ ed patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
&quot; during the ex@@ position of liver therapy of liver , kid@@ ney and cardi@@ ogen@@ ic recei@@ vers were usually used blood concentr@@ ations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml . &quot;
&quot; this has led to severe undes@@ irable events , including transpl@@ antation or other side effects , which can occur in a result of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus under@@ - or over@@ ex@@ position . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; conver@@ sions of the formulation or the regime should only be made under the tight@@ ening control of one in the transpl@@ ant experienced physician ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; 5 For the treatment of adult patients with transpl@@ antation , which proved to be contrary to other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ res@@ va , nor does not represent a clinical data for the retar@@ ded formulation of Adv@@ ag@@ raf . &quot;
to the proph@@ yla@@ xis of tran@@ splan@@ ts in adults and transpl@@ ant@@ mentation at the child &apos;s age are still no clinical data for the retar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ ag@@ raf .

&quot; in patients with Di@@ ar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - concentr@@ ations in the blood has offered , since the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m blood levels under such circumstances may be considerable fluctu@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f was known as di@@ omy@@ opathy , Kam@@ mer@@ - or Se@@ pt@@ um@@ hyper@@ trop@@ ic , which can therefore also be observed at Adv@@ ag@@ raf . &quot;
&quot; other factors , which increase the risk of such clinical disorders , are an already existing heart suffering , a treatment with cor@@ tical cor@@ ero@@ id , hyper@@ tension , kid@@ ney or liver dys@@ functions , infections , hydr@@ ation and o@@ ils . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ res@@ va , the exposure of sunlight and UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin changes due to appropriate clothing or use of a solar protection by means of a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients who take Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m , symptoms for P@@ RES such as he@@ ada@@ ches , changed consciousness levels , cr@@ amps and visual disorders , should be a radi@@ ological investigation ( e.@@ g . &quot;

&quot; the simultaneous application of pharmaceuticals or herbal remedies that are known as Hem@@ mer or indu@@ ctors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m can increase or decrease the blood levels of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; it is therefore recommended to change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - blood levels at simultaneous flu@@ ids of substances that can change the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and to adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m dose for maintaining even@@ ly concentr@@ ations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; a strongly distinctive interaction was made with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ic such as K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol , Flu@@ con@@ az@@ ol , I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ol and Vor@@ all@@ az@@ ol , as well as with the Macro@@ lid in@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV @-@ Prot@@ e@@ as@@ cop@@ es ( z ) . &quot;
&quot; Pharmac@@ ology studies , that the increase in blood levels mainly consists of the increased bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m , caused by the inhi@@ bition of the gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal distor@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; high @-@ do@@ cking Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as it is used in ac@@ ute recur@@ ring reactions , can increase concentration of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m in the blood or cut down . &quot;
effect of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 Hem@@ mer ; hence the simultaneous application of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m can be met@@ aboli@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 met@@ aboli@@ zed .
&quot; as Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m can raise the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid @-@ contr@@ az@@ ep@@ tiv@@ a , so that the hormonal im@@ position can increase in decisions about recep@@ tive measures especially careful . &quot;
the results of animal welfare have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m can reduce the Clear@@ ance of Pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ on and extend their sem@@ it@@ times .
&quot; the results of a limited number of investigations on transpl@@ ant patients provide no indication of that among Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m , compared to other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ res@@ va , a increased risk for unwanted events relating to the course and outcome of pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; in uter@@ o exposure , the monitoring of the new@@ born effect is recommended to possible any harmful effects of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m ( especially with regard to its effect on the kid@@ neys ) . &quot;

&quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ub@@ ility and the high bond of er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and Plas@@ map@@ rot@@ eine can be assumed that Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m is not di@@ aly@@ sis . &quot;

&quot; based on the published data available since the first release of the CH@@ MP , the CH@@ MP benefits has been rated as positive , but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored on the following reasons : &quot;
&quot; therefore , CH@@ MP is on the basis of the safety pro@@ fil@@ s of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which makes a submission of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , decided that the filing holder in 5 years should apply another extension . &quot;
December 2008 The Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ec@@ ular Limited to the Committee for Human@@ arz@@ ti@@ ze ( CH@@ MP ) officially recognised that the company takes its application for the transport of Adv@@ ex@@ in to the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
&quot; however , the chest , the brain , the bones , the bones or the soft@@ ness ( tissues which links other structures in the body , sur@@ rounds and supported ) . &quot;
&quot; this is a type of virus that has been altered , the gene@@ tically modified in the body of the body . &quot;
&quot; an &quot; &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; , &quot; it is a &quot; &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; &quot; that it has changed so that there cannot be copies of himself and thus no infections in humans can trigger . &quot;
Adv@@ ex@@ in would have been sent directly into the tum@@ ors and to enable the cancer cells to re@@ form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed from the def@@ ective in the human body existing p@@ 53 gene , usually bears the restoration of corru@@ pt DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered . &quot;
&quot; at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer , in which the p@@ 53 protein is def@@ ective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company put data from a study with a patient prior to the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer in the field of sub @-@ building , in the bones and in the brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP replies the answers to the company on the questions , there were still some questions un@@ solved . &quot;
&quot; based on the review of initial submitted documents created the CH@@ MP on Day 120 , a list of questions that will be sent to the company . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP , not sufficiently proved that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ors will bring benefits to the patient . &quot;
the committee also had concerns about the processing of pharmaceuticals in the body , the type of administration and security of drugs . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company had not proven sufficient to be manufactured in a reliable way and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
the company set the CH@@ MP not of it whether the withdrawal consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical studies or &quot; Comp@@ assi@@ onate Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ent .
&quot; changed drug fre@@ ading &quot; means that tablets are as assembled , that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours . &quot;
aer@@ on@@ ze is used for treating the symptoms of seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( ha@@ y fe@@ ver through an all@@ ergy to p@@ ollen in the nose @-@ called infl@@ amm@@ ation of the nose @-@ sw@@ elling ) in patients with no@@ zzles sw@@ elling ( pet@@ ri@@ fter nose ) .
&quot; for adults and young adults from 12 years the recommended dose of aer@@ on@@ ze twice daily , which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and ended as soon as the symptoms , especially the sw@@ elling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( pet@@ ting nose ) . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of drugs can be veri@@ fied via the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main @-@ effic@@ acy dimensions were the changes of the sever@@ ity of the ha@@ schn@@ u@@ pf@@ ym@@ at@@ oms which have been reported by the patient before the beginning of the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study , patients tru@@ sts their symptoms every 12 hours into a diary and evaluated with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; in cont@@ empl@@ ating of all the ha@@ schn@@ u@@ pf@@ chi@@ pt@@ ome , besides the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose reported the patients , the Aer@@ ators reported on a withdrawal of symptoms by 46,@@ 0 % , compared with 35,@@ 9 % in the patient , the pseu@@ do@@ e@@ ph@@ edr@@ ine alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the sw@@ elling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was seen , the patients showed an alle@@ vi@@ ation of the symptoms around 37@@ ,@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients , the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aer@@ on@@ ze ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are T@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ der ( cardi@@ ac disease ) , v@@ no@@ re@@ x@@ ie , fatigue , he@@ ada@@ che , fatigue , In@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness ) , som@@ at@@ ol@@ ence ( Sil@@ ence ) , ins@@ om@@ nia and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ ators may not be hy@@ pers@@ ensi@@ bly ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , pseu@@ do@@ e@@ ph@@ edr@@ in or one of the other components , against rep@@ lication active ingredients or Lor@@ at@@ adin ( another drug for treatment of allergi@@ es ) are not applied . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ ators may also not be used in patients who suffer from a Eng@@ ines ( increased water pressure ) , hyper@@ thy@@ roid ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ roid ( hyper@@ tension in the thy@@ roid ) or have already caused a hem@@ orrho@@ id ( hyper@@ tension ) , or have a risk for hem@@ at@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission passed on to the SP Europe - a permit for the transport of Aer@@ ators in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however , is in the whole to swal@@ low ( i.e. without them to break down , break or chew@@ ing ) . &quot;
aer@@ on@@ ze should not be applied in children under 12 years due to the mal@@ eness and effectiveness ( see section 5.1 ) in children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after lowering the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application duration of 10 days since on long @-@ term application the activity of pseu@@ do@@ e@@ ph@@ edr@@ ine can decrease in time .
&quot; according to the sw@@ elling of the sw@@ elling in the upper breath , the treatment can continue with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin as a mon@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; since aer@@ on@@ ze pseu@@ do@@ e@@ ph@@ edr@@ ine contains , the drug is also con@@ train@@ dic@@ ated in patients who are treated with a mon@@ o@@ amin@@ ox@@ i@@ da@@ se ( MA@@ O ) and within 2 weeks of termination of such treatment . &quot;
&quot; this is attribut@@ able to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ e@@ tic activity in combined application of pseu@@ do@@ e@@ ph@@ edr@@ ine , with other vas@@ o@@ ph@@ ric , Er@@ go@@ lid , Er@@ go@@ id , Er@@ go@@ lid , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , Ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ ine , Nap@@ haz@@ olin etc . ) . &quot;
security and the effectiveness of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient lecture and the dates are not enough to address corresponding recommendations for the dosage .
safety and the effectiveness of aer@@ on@@ es were not tested in patients with kid@@ ney or liver mode and the dates are not enough to address corresponding recommendations for the dosage .
&quot; patients must be informed about the treatment in the occurrence of hyper@@ tension or a t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ a@@ or , or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms , nau@@ sea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as he@@ ada@@ che or an increase of he@@ ada@@ che ) must be de@@ posed . &quot;
&quot; in treating the following patient groups , patients with cardiovascular diseases • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ din@@ ge in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder so@@ b@@ ular or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ op@@ ze is at least 48 hours prior to the accompl@@ ishment of dermat@@ ological testing , as anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ine can prevent positive reactions to indicators on your own actions or reduce it in their scale . &quot;
&quot; in the framework of clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , in which Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol in addition have been admini@@ stered , however , were not clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma @-@ centr@@ ation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; in the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or tests , there were no significant differences between those with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and those treated with plac@@ ebo patients irrespective of whether Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was taken alone or with alcohol . &quot;
&quot; it has not yet been identified for the metabolism of des@@ al@@ at@@ adin , so interactions with other medicines cannot be completely excluded . &quot;
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin inhi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 not , and in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhi@@ bits and neither a substr@@ ate nor an in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or of the P gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins . &quot;
&quot; the in@@ convenience of the use of aer@@ on@@ es during pregnancy is not secured , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies , however , no increase in the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities when compared with the normal population . &quot;
&quot; since the reproduction of animals is not always transmitted to humans , and due to the v@@ ascular characteristics of pseu@@ do@@ e@@ ph@@ edr@@ ine should not be used in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be un@@ clari@@ fied that it may occur in very rare cases to lead to an imp@@ air@@ ment or the ability to serve machines . &quot;

in controlled clinical studies the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily has no increased frequency of sl@@ ings compared to plac@@ ebo .
&quot; the or@@ ale application of pseu@@ do@@ e@@ ph@@ edr@@ ine in the recommended dosage can provide further sympath@@ om@@ im@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ mic or manifest@@ ations of a Z@@ NS arous@@ al . &quot;
&quot; there were 1.@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis , with 4@@ 14 patients Aer@@ op@@ ze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies the hi@@ stam@@ ine effectiveness of aer@@ on@@ ze tablets , determined based on the total co@@ res for sy@@ mptom wor@@ ding ( except no@@ zzles with pseu@@ do@@ e@@ ph@@ edr@@ in over the 2 @-@ week treatment times . &quot;
the effectiveness of aer@@ on@@ ze tablets with regard to the sul@@ try effect determined based on the nose @-@ sw@@ elling effect , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin over the 2 @-@ week treatment times . &quot;
the effectiveness of aer@@ on@@ ze tablets showed in regard to gender , age or eth@@ ni@@ city defined patient groups any significant differences . &quot;

A@@ eri@@ us was examined in eight studies with approximately 4 800 adults and young people with allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( including four studies in seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis and two studies in patients who also had as@@ thma ) .
&quot; the effectiveness has been measured by the change of symptoms ( ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z , number and size of the squares , imp@@ air@@ ment of the sleep and the performance on the day ) before and after six @-@ week treatment . &quot;
&quot; other studies have been submitted to im@@ itate that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution for inser@@ ting and the mel@@ ting tab@@ let@@ ts in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; associated with allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis , when the results of all studies were summar@@ ized , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us to an average acceptance of sy@@ mptom points ( sy@@ mptom points ) by 25 to 32 % compared to the removal of 12 to 26 % in the patients that received a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies at Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the acceptance of sy@@ mptom @-@ based treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % compared with plac@@ ebo patients . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us cannot be used in patients that may be hy@@ pers@@ ensi@@ tive ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , Lor@@ at@@ adin , or one of the other components . &quot;
January 2001 shared the European Commission for the SP Europe . permit approval for the offices of A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union .
&quot; one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to alle@@ vi@@ ate the symptoms associated with allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( including inter@@ locking and pers@@ ist allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
total experience gained from clinical studies for the effectiveness of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in young people from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
&quot; the treatment of inter@@ acting allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the previous disease process , and can end up after completion of symptoms and re @-@ end up again . &quot;
in the Persian Rhin@@ i@@ tis ( appearance of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) may be recommended to patients during the aller@@ ding time treatment .
clin@@ ically relevant inverters have not been established in clinical studies with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin tablets were not established in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol in addition have been admini@@ stered ( see below section 5.1 ) .
in a clin@@ ically phar@@ ological study was not reinforced in simultaneous intake of ast@@ eri@@ us and alcohol the performance effects of alcohol ( see below 5.1 ) .
&quot; however , patients should be clari@@ fied that it may occur in very rare cases , which can lead to imp@@ air@@ ment or the ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; clinical studies in various indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis and chron@@ ically idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , as in case of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most frequently infl@@ ated side effects that was reported more frequently than in plac@@ ebo , fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , mouth @-@ dried ( 0,@@ 8 % ) and he@@ ada@@ ches ( 0,@@ 6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with 5@@ 78 adol@@ es@@ cent patients from 12 to 17 years was the most common side @-@ effect he@@ ada@@ ches , these entered at 5,@@ 9 % of the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and at 6.9 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study , in which up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was admini@@ stered ( nin@@ ety @-@ fold clinical dosage ) were observed , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; this includes both the inhi@@ bition of the release of pro@@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / Bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the inhi@@ bition of the expression of the ad@@ gar @-@ ter@@ ol@@ ü@@ ls P @-@ Sel@@ ect@@ tin on End@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ al@@ cells . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical study involving multi@@ disciplinary study , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was admini@@ stered in a dosage of up to 20 mg every day over 14 days , no statis@@ tically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect has been described . &quot;
&quot; in a clin@@ ically phar@@ ological study , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( which was sufficient for ten days daily ) showed no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c intervals . &quot;
&quot; for an individual dos@@ ing study with adults showed DES@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg no influence on standard measuring sizes of the fluid sizes , including the strengthening of subjective phar@@ yn@@ ge@@ ons or the tasks that are connected to the F@@ lies . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis was a@@ eri@@ us effectively in the alle@@ vi@@ ation of symptoms , such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and red@@ ness of the nose , ju@@ icy and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and Per@@ enni@@ al , may be allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis in dependence on the duration of the symptoms , alternatively also in inter@@ acting allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis and the Persian Rhin@@ i@@ tis . &quot;
inter@@ com@@ ant allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis is defined as a appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
personalized r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis is defined as a occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks .
&quot; as on the basis of the overall life of the questionn@@ aire on the quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ Con@@ vi@@ tis was shown , dimin@@ ished A@@ eri@@ us effectively , caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis . &quot;
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tik@@ aria was responding to further forms of the Ur@@ tik@@ aria , since the underlying path@@ olog@@ ology is similar to the e@@ ti@@ ology of the different forms that is similar and chron@@ ical patients can be sim@@ ulated prospec@@ tively . &quot;
&quot; as hi@@ st@@ amin@@ ated disease is an urs@@ ory factor in all ur@@ inary diseases , is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is also anticipated by the chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tik@@ aria also in other forms of Ur@@ tik@@ aria to an improvement of the symptoms , this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the descent of size and number of squares at the end of the first dosage intervals . &quot;
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ine in chron@@ ically idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the minority of patients who are not re@@ acted to anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ine ika , from the trial . &quot;
an improvement of the itch to more than 50 % was treated at 55 % of patients with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin treated patients compared to 19 % of the patients treated with plac@@ ebo patients .
&quot; the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the disturb@@ ance of the sleep and vig@@ our , as determined by a 4 @-@ point scale to assess this variable . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmaceutical drug study , in which the patients &quot; dem@@ ograph@@ ics with the general seasonal Rhin@@ i@@ tis population was comparable , in 4 % of patients achieved a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
there are no cl@@ ues for clin@@ ically relevant Kum@@ ulation after a daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
&quot; it has not yet been identified for the metabolism of des@@ al@@ at@@ adin , however , has not yet been identified as interactions with other medicines will not be completely excluded . &quot;
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin inhi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo not CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhi@@ bits and neither a substr@@ ate nor an in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or of the P gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
in a single dos@@ ing study involving Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of 7.5 mg at meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie breakfast ) do not affect the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
the clinical trials carried out with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ at@@ adin conducted in a compar@@ ative degree of exposure to Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , no qualitative or quantitative differences with regard to the tox@@ icity of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and by Lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on security met@@ ac@@ ology , tox@@ icity , tox@@ icity , Gen@@ oto@@ x@@ icity and to Re@@ production , the pre@@ clinical data can be recognized with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin do not recognise any particular haz@@ ards to men . &quot;

&quot; A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independent of meals , to alle@@ vi@@ ate the symptoms associated with allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( including inter@@ locking and pers@@ ist allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the prescription doctor should be aware that most cases of r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see below 4.4 ) and that no data is provided to support an inf@@ ectious Rhin@@ i@@ tis with A@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respir@@ atory infections or anatom@@ ic an@@ om@@ ali@@ es should play a role in diagnosis the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese , physical investigations and corresponding laboratory and skin seek@@ ers . &quot;
approximately 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years met@@ abolic rate are limited and experienced a higher sub @-@ tail load ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the safety of A@@ eri@@ us Si@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , which met@@ abolic , is identical with the children that are normal met@@ abolic . &quot;
&quot; this drug contains suc@@ rose and Sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients should not take patients with inher@@ ited problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , gl@@ uc@@ ose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ absorption or a bur@@ ring @-@ is@@ om@@ ission @-@ in@@ suff@@ iciency of this medicine . &quot;
&quot; clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not established in the course of clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol in addition have been admini@@ stered ( see below section 5.1 ) . &quot;
in a clin@@ ically phar@@ ological study was not reinforced in simultaneous intake of A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol the affor@@ ding effect of alcohol is not reinforced ( see below 5.1 ) .
the overall housing of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Si@@ rup Group as in the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; in clinical studies with adults and young people in various indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , were reported in the recommended dose 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , treated as patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolesc@@ ents , during which up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin were admini@@ stered ( nin@@ ety @-@ fold clinical dosage ) were observed , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; children aged between 1 and 11 years , for an anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ine therapy in question received a daily Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ind@@ dose of 1,25 mg ( at the age between 1 and 5 years ) or 2,5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) . &quot;
because the course of allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis / chron@@ ically idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tik@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin can be similar to adults and children can be extr@@ ap@@ ol@@ ished with adults on children &apos;s population .
&quot; in the framework of a clinical study involving multiple adults , adults and adolesc@@ ents , in a dosage of up to 20 mg in a dosage of up to 20 mg has been applied daily over 14 days , no statis@@ tically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect has been described . &quot;
in a clin@@ ically phar@@ ological study of adults and adolesc@@ ents in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( which was applied for the ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) over ten days in adults showed no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c intervals .
in controlled clinical studies the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolesc@@ ents have no increased frequency of sl@@ ings compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a single daily dose of 7.5 mg the A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolesc@@ ents in clinical trials do not imp@@ ly imp@@ air@@ ment of the psych@@ ot@@ or .
&quot; in clin@@ ically phar@@ ological studies of adults came it by the simultaneous intake of alcohol , neither to rein@@ forcement of alcohol in@@ duced performance even at an increase in phar@@ yn@@ ge@@ vity . &quot;
&quot; when adult and adol@@ es@@ cent patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis were effective in the alle@@ vi@@ ation of symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and red@@ ness of the nose , ju@@ icy and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; as based on the overall life of the questionn@@ aire on the quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ Con@@ vi@@ tis was shown , ver@@ min@@ ders A@@ eri@@ us tablets are effectively highlighted by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the descent of size and number of squares at the end of the first dosage intervals . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this limited met@@ abolic phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % adults , 16 % children ) than at Cau@@ ca@@ sians ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
similar pharmac@@ ological parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ological multi @-@ dose study involving families between 2 and 11 years with allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis .
the strain ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was about 3 to 6 hours later and the C@@ max about 3 to 4@@ times higher with a tempor@@ al half @-@ time period of about 120 hours .
there are no cl@@ ue for a clin@@ ically relevant active ingre@@ dient after a daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolesc@@ ents .
&quot; 12 In different individual dose studies showed that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values are comparable with pedi@@ atric patients with recommended doses , with those of adults , the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin sy@@ rup in a dosage of 5 mg received . &quot;
&quot; it has not yet been identified for the metabolism of des@@ al@@ at@@ adin , however , it has not been completely ruled that interactions with other medicines will not be completely excluded . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us Si@@ rup is offered in type III @-@ brown bottles with child @-@ friendly poly@@ propylene ( poly@@ propylene ) with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml offered . &quot;

&quot; a dose of A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at to take once daily in the mouth , to alle@@ vi@@ ate the symptoms in allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( including inter@@ locking and pers@@ ist allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully open and the dosage of the Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ats must be taken away without damage . &quot;
&quot; clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not established in the course of clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were also applied in addition ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; clinical studies in various indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis and chronic r@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , as in case of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
in a multi @-@ dose study which have been applied up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nin@@ ety @-@ fold clinical dosage ) were not observed in clin@@ ically relevant effects .
&quot; in two single @-@ dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate was well toler@@ ated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical investigations , Vital@@ mark and EC@@ G @-@ Inter@@ v@@ all@@ data . &quot;
&quot; in the framework of a clinical study with multi @-@ disciplinary study , in a dosage of up to 20 mg in a dosage of up to 20 mg has been applied daily over 14 days , no statis@@ tically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect has been described . &quot;

the overall settlement of side @-@ side effects between the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine Si@@ rup@@ - and the Plac@@ eb@@ og@@ ram was the same and turned out to be significantly significant from that of adult patients .
in the recommended dose the A@@ eri@@ us melt was equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at for in@@ corporation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin .
&quot; as part of a clinical study with multi @-@ disciplinary study , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin has been used in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , not statis@@ tically significant or clin@@ ically . &quot;
&quot; in a single @-@ dose study with adults showed DES@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg no influence on standard measurement sizes of the fluid sizes , including the strengthening of subjective phar@@ yn@@ ge@@ ons or the tasks that are connected to the F@@ lies . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this bad met@@ abolic phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and under black ( adults 18 % , children 3 % ) , the safety profile of these patients was not separate from that of the general population . &quot;

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l . the Committee for Human@@ arz@@ ti@@ ze ( CH@@ MP ) officially recognised that the company takes its application for approval from A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to the prevention of avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 @-@ Inf@@ lu@@ enza in adults and older people .
&quot; A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be caused by adults and elderly people to protect flu , which is caused by the tribe ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the Inf@@ lu@@ enza @-@ A virus . &quot;
&quot; this is a special type of vaccine that could result in front of a trunk of influ@@ enza , which could cause a future p@@ and@@ emic . &quot;
&quot; a Gri@@ p@@ pep@@ and@@ emic breaks out when a new tribe of the flu virus emerg@@ es , which can easily spread from man to man because human beings have not yet established immunity ( no protection ) against it . &quot;
&quot; after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the immune system included in the vaccine contained in the vaccine contained in the vaccine as &quot; &quot; bodi@@ ly &quot; &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot;
this makes the immune system later in the position to form with a contact with a influ@@ enza of this St@@ am@@ ms fast si@@ RNA .
then the membrane envelop@@ e of the virus with the &quot; surface surface &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface which can be det@@ ained by the human body as physical alien ) and used as an element of the vaccine .
a inspection of some of the study centres showed that the study was not conducted according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
this makes the scope of clinical data base for assessing the safety of the vaccine not to fulfill the requirements of the EMEA area for preventive vacc@@ ines .
&quot; should you take part in a clinical trial and require further information about your treatment , please feel free to contact your doctor . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information regarding the recommendations of the CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in combination with other anti@@ vir@@ al medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are caused by human Immun@@ e De@@ evi@@ rus from type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) which are infected with the acquired immune De@@ fic@@ iency Syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who can not swal@@ low the capsules are available as a solution for inser@@ tion , but these can not be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the security of this combination was not examined . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ a should only be attributed , if the doctor has checked the anti @-@ vir@@ al medicines of the patient before has taken , and the lik@@ eli@@ hood is judged that the virus will talk to the drug . &quot;
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years amounts to 600 mg twice daily , which can be taken together with twice daily 100 mg of k@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ vir@@ al drugs . &quot;
&quot; in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ a depends on the body weight . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase is reduced in combination with other anti@@ vir@@ al medicines the HIV @-@ amount in the blood and keeps them at a low level .
&quot; AIDS not to heal , however , may cause the damage of the immune system and therefore the development of AIDS related infections and diseases . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was examined in combination with other anti@@ vir@@ al medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults , which previously had not been treated with Prot@@ e@@ as@@ cul@@ es . &quot;
&quot; that with low do@@ si@@ zed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r strengthened medicine A@@ gener@@ ase was taken at 206 adults , which had formerly used to protest with other proteins . &quot;
main indic@@ ative for the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with non @-@ con@@ den@@ able concentr@@ ations of HIV in the blood ( Vir@@ us@@ last ) or the change of vir@@ us@@ last after treatment .
&quot; in the studies with patients who had previously taken no prot@@ e@@ as@@ ties , namely after 48 weeks under A@@ gener@@ a , more patients had a Vir@@ us@@ last less than 400 copies / ml than among plac@@ ebo , but as@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children , A@@ gener@@ a also decreased the vir@@ us@@ last , but were treated by the children who had previously been treated with Prot@@ e@@ as@@ ties , only very few on the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults , which had been treated earlier with Prot@@ e@@ as@@ ties , which resulted in the Vir@@ on@@ avi@@ r enhanced medicine A@@ gener@@ ase , after 16 @-@ week treatment just as effective as other prot@@ e@@ as@@ former : &quot;
&quot; in patients with HIV , which was against four other prot@@ e@@ as@@ cul@@ ent resistant , it came under as@@ gener@@ ase , together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste of vir@@ us@@ last after four weeks as among the patients who continued their previous prot@@ e@@ as@@ ties : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed at more than 1 of 10 patients ) are he@@ ada@@ ches , di@@ ar@@ rho@@ ea ( di@@ aly@@ sis ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , v@@ om@@ iting , r@@ ash and Fati@@ gue ( fatigue ) . &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ a must not be used in patients that may be hy@@ pers@@ ensi@@ tive ( allergic ) against Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r or one of the other components .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ a must also not be used in patients , the Joh@@ an@@ nis@@ kr@@ aut ( a herbal supplements to treat depression ) or medicines which are just as as@@ gener@@ ase and are in high concentr@@ ations in the blood health of health . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines for HIV , the A@@ gener@@ ic drugs are taking the risk of a Li@@ br@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of the body fat ) , an O@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( Ab@@ die of bone tissue ) or an immun@@ o@@ ac@@ tic syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of an infection which are caused by taking a relaxing immune system ) . &quot;
the committee for humanity ten@@ ants ( CH@@ MP ) had to conclude that the benefits of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines used to treat with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines used to treat HIV @-@ 1 @-@ in@@ infected adults and children over four years to the risks .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ a is usually taken together with the phar@@ mak@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee presented that the use of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who have previously been no prot@@ e@@ as@@ cul@@ ated , not proven . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ a was originally licensed under &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; , as at the time of approval for scientific reasons only limited information . &quot;
October 2000 divided the European Commission to the Gla@@ x@@ o Group Limited approval for the market development of A@@ gener@@ ase in the entire European Union .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1- infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ par@@ mer ( PI ) -@@ previously @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years . &quot;
&quot; usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules for a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ ster of Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r can be admini@@ stered together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the use of Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual vir@@ al Resi@@ stance patterns and the pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the bio@@ availability of Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r as a solution for inser@@ tion is 14 % lower than by Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , as@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for inser@@ tion on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base does not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for ather@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg of k@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines .
2 If as@@ gener@@ ase capsules without the increased rate of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ stery ) must be applied higher doses at A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for ather@@ ase capsules is 20 mg Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r / kg body@@ weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines to a daily basis of 2400 mg Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r which should not be exce@@ eded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; pharmaceuticals , effectiveness and safety of as@@ gener@@ a in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other proteins in children have not been studied . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ a is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the mal@@ eness of data to harm@@ lessness and effectiveness ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on the pharmac@@ ological data , the dose should be reduced to A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate @-@ sized liver @-@ dysfunction at 450 mg twice daily and in patients with heavy liver dys@@ functions on 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous application should be carried out in patients with mild or moderate living @-@ dysfunction , in patients with severe liver @-@ dysfunction , it is con@@ train@@ dic@@ ated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase must not be given at the same time with pharmaceuticals that have a low therapeutic width and also represent substr@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ y@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal supplements are included in Joh@@ an@@ nis@@ kr@@ aut ( hyper@@ icum perfor@@ ation ) may not be applied due to the risk reduction and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r during the intake of Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be pointed out that as@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opport@@ un@@ istic infection or other complications of an HIV infection .
&quot; the current anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy , including treatment with ather@@ ases , does not prevent the risk of transmission from HIV to other through sexual contact or cont@@ amination with blood . &quot;
&quot; usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al drugs will be applied ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients who suffer from chronic he@@ pati@@ tis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy and have increased risk for heavy lives effects with potential fat@@ ality course .
for the fall of a simultaneous anti@@ vir@@ al treatment of he@@ pati@@ tis B or C please read the subject @-@ related information of these medications .

because the adju@@ sting of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ er @-@ Hem@@ mer Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ vast@@ atin strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended as simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ vast@@ atin because of the increased risk of My@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sen .
&quot; 4 For some medicines which can cause serious or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ bit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International standardization ratio ) , methods for determining the drug con@@ cent@@ ric concentration . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients who take these medicines at the same time , A@@ gener@@ a may be less effective due to reduced plastic levels of Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r less effective ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of met@@ abolic interactions with Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tiv@@ a can be altered , however , the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is given simultaneously with Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ angl@@ ements , especially if next , even low doses can be admini@@ stered by Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; because of the possible risk of tox@@ icity due to the high prop@@ yl@@ gly@@ col solution for inser@@ tion , this is con@@ train@@ dic@@ ated in children under the age of four years and should be applied with caution at certain other patient groups . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be placed on duration 5 , if a r@@ ash of system@@ ic or allergic sy@@ mptom is accompanied or the mu@@ cos@@ ity are involved ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients who received anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy including Prot@@ e@@ as@@ former , was reported via the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gl@@ y@@ a@@ emia or an exc@@ itation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . &quot;

&quot; although a multi@@ fac@@ tor@@ ial e@@ ti@@ ology is accepted ( including the application of cor@@ tik@@ ost@@ ero@@ ids , alcohol @-@ consumption , higher Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose in particular were reported in patients with advanced HIV @-@ disorder and / or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 substr@@ ates with low therapeutic width is not allowed simultaneously with pharmaceuticals that possess a low therapeutic width and also represent substr@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ y@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substr@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase can not be produced along with pharmaceuticals whose molecular entities will be exchanged mainly via CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and is associated with raised plasma @-@ in @-@ law and / or vital @-@ threat@@ ening side effects .
it was shown that ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in is caused by a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C by Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r that can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ ast@@ rolog@@ ical failure and lead to a resistance development .
&quot; in the attempt to put the lower plastic level through a dosage of other prot@@ ease @-@ inhi@@ bit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very frequently unwanted effects on the liver were observed . &quot;
Joh@@ an@@ nis@@ kr@@ aut ( Hyper@@ icum perfor@@ ation ) The Ser@@ um@@ ental of Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r can be de@@ du@@ cted by the simultaneous application of herbal supplements with Joh@@ an@@ nis@@ kr@@ aut ( hyper@@ icum perfor@@ ation ) .
&quot; when a patient takes already Joh@@ an@@ nis@@ kr@@ aut , the Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r@@ spiegel and , if possible to verify the virus @-@ load and de@@ du@@ ce the Joh@@ an@@ nis@@ kr@@ aut . &quot;
a dosage adjustment for one of the medicine is not required when Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is admini@@ stered together with Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ ence below ) .
5@@ 08 % increased to C@@ max on the other hand by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
&quot; in clinical studies , doses of 600 mg of Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which occupy the effectiveness and im@@ itation of this treatment . &quot;
52 % reduced when Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ avi@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r in plasma which have been reached in combination of Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg of k@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
&quot; a lecturer for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it is not recommended for eng@@ aging surveillance because the effectiveness and im@@ itation of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; it has been no pharmac@@ ological study to use A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , however , due to the ant@@ acid component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine is recommended that the revenue of th@@ dan@@ os@@ ine and ather@@ ase is at least one hour apart . ( see Ant@@ azi@@ da below ) . &quot;
therefore in combination of E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ ence in combination with Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dosage adjustment .
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ ence in combination with Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both Prot@@ e@@ as@@ par@@ mer would be low .
the effect of Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in to other Prot@@ e@@ as@@ former and available limited data allow for Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in the Ser@@ um@@ Con@@ centr@@ ation of Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r possibly lowers .
&quot; if these medicines should be used at the same time , caution is offered , since Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din because of the decreased and possibly sub@@ therapeutic plastic levels could be less effective . &quot;
&quot; if these medicines will be applied together , caution is offered ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ cal surveillance should be made , as a precise predi@@ ction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din difficult . &quot;
the simultaneous gli@@ de of Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in the Plas@@ mac@@ on@@ centr@@ ation ( AU@@ C ) of Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 193 % and thus to a rise in dealing with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin side effects .
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin along with ather@@ ase , to reduce the dosage of Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data . &quot;
pharmaceutical studies with A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not carried out but could be increased the plastic level of both medicines in the case of simultaneous administration .
simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol in plasma around 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ ) compared to the value that was observed after 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once daily without simultaneous application of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines which are listed below , including substr@@ ates , Hem@@ mer , or indu@@ ctors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , if they are being used together with ather@@ ases , possibly to interactions . &quot;
&quot; patients should therefore be associated to tox@@ ic reactions that are associated with these drugs , if they are used in combination with ather@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; based on the data of other prot@@ e@@ as@@ former , it is advisable that ant@@ acids can not be taken at the same time as as@@ gener@@ ase , since it may come to res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application of anti @-@ vul@@ va , known as a enzym@@ es @-@ du@@ ctors ( Phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , Phen@@ ob@@ bit@@ al , Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r can lead to a de@@ grad@@ ation of the plasma @-@ mass of Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; the Ser@@ um concentr@@ ations of calcium carbon@@ ates such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , lat@@ ti@@ az@@ em , tin @-@ pin , ro@@ vo pin , N@@ ant@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased 10 through Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r , thus increasing the activity and tox@@ icity of this medicine . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous intake with as@@ gener@@ a can increase their Plas@@ mac@@ on@@ zentr@@ ations considerably and increase with PD@@ E@@ 5 @-@ inhi@@ bit@@ ors in connection side effects , including hyp@@ ot@@ ile , visual dys@@ functions and Pri@@ ap@@ hor@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days at pro@@ tr@@ as@@ on@@ at @-@ plasma plasma at approximately 86 % decreased ( 90 % -@@ full interval of 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; consequently , the simultaneous go@@ ose of as@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended by Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r along with these gl@@ yp@@ tic tik@@ o@@ ids , unless the possible benefit of treatment the risk system@@ ic cor@@ i@@ ster@@ o@@ ero@@ i@@ der effects prev@@ ails ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; at H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduction im@@ balance , such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ vast@@ atin whose closures are strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are prepared and intensi@@ fy Incre@@ asing of Plasma at simultaneous administration of as@@ gener@@ a . &quot;
&quot; since Plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ per increases this H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ ers to My@@ opathy , including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ se , the combined application of these medicines is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; it is advisable to be a common monitoring of therapeutic concentr@@ ations by stabili@@ zation of the mirror , since the Plas@@ mac@@ on@@ centr@@ ations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m can be increased by Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , A@@ gener@@ a must not be applied together with oral performed mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , during the simultaneous use of as@@ gener@@ a with par@@ enter@@ ic mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution . &quot;
data for the simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ ic mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors to a possible rise in the plasma @-@ level of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am about 3 to 4 @-@ fold .
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is admini@@ stered together with Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on a pi@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ angl@@ ements , especially if next , even low doses can be admini@@ stered by Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the per se low per@@ me@@ ability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation is given to adapt as the Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r@@ - dose when Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r is admini@@ stered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one simultaneously . &quot;
&quot; in the simultaneous gift of War@@ far@@ in or other or@@ al anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ a , a reinforced control of the IN@@ R ( International Standards ratio ) because of the possibility of a weak@@ ening or strengthening of anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tive is not pre@@ dict@@ able , therefore also alternative methods for contrac@@ eption is recommended . &quot;
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example D@@ esi@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended for simult@@ ane@@ ity of A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; this medicine may only be applied during pregnancy only after careful weighing of possible use for the mother , compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in the milk l@@ ac@@ tic rat , Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were proven , however , it is not known as Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r in humans in the mother &apos;s milk . &quot;

the further development of the income including Fer@@ til@@ ity and Re@@ production is not affected by the administration of Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r to the wom@@ tier .
the in@@ convenience of as@@ gener@@ a was examined in adults and in children from 4 years in controlled clinical studies in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al drugs .
most with the as@@ gener@@ ase treatment associated side effects were easy to moderate , occurred early on and led rarely to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in many of these events cannot be clari@@ fied , whether they are related to the intake of as@@ gener@@ ase or any other simultaneously to HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the above @-@ side effects date are from two clinical studies ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which with Prot@@ e@@ as@@ ties not pre @-@ treated patients 1200 mg a@@ gener@@ ase twice daily . &quot;
&quot; inci@@ dents ( degrees 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated by the testing doctors as well as in connection with the study drugs , and more than 1 % of the patients occurred , as well as under the treatment of dental laboratories ( degrees 3 to 4 ) are listed . &quot;

&quot; the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorith@@ m for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance , or at least 4 of the following mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / I , L@@ 33@@ F , M@@ 36@@ I , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in connection with a increased ph@@ onic resistance to Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as well as an increased lik@@ eli@@ hood of a vi@@ cal response ( Resi@@ st@@ ence ) . &quot;
&quot; the conclusions with regard to the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation sm@@ u@@ ster can be subject to changes due to additional data , and it is recommended to always move the current inter@@ pret@@ ations systems to analyse the results of resistance tests . &quot;
on phenomen@@ al resistance @-@ based analyses clin@@ ically vali@@ dated inter@@ pret@@ ations systems can be used in conjunction with the gen@@ otype data for the estim@@ ation of the activity of Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with Prot@@ e@@ as@@ cul@@ mer isolation .

&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r re@@ tains its activity against some other proteins in isolation ; the preservation of these activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in isolation . &quot;
the early dis@@ ruption of an ag@@ ag@@ ic therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits that can affect the subsequent treatment .
&quot; the cover of the effectiveness of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a rand@@ om@@ ized open study , in which with PI ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ k@@ le@@ osi@@ dan@@ al@@ oga ( NR@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , So@@ C ) with a PI , predomin@@ antly with lower j@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; b@@ oo@@ st@@ ert , &quot; received . &quot;

&quot; after 48 weeks , about 25 % of the registered patients had a Plasma HIV @-@ 1 @-@ RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml with a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cells of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the output . &quot;
&quot; 19 Basi@@ ating on these data should be considered with the therapy for the treatment of &quot; un@@ bund@@ ling &quot; &quot; as@@ gener@@ als &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; after oral administration , the average duration ( t@@ max ) up to the maximum ser@@ um concentration by Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0,5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
5@@ 08 % increases for C@@ max is reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) together with Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
&quot; the administration of Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % minimum acceptance of the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r 12 hours of dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the minimum concentration at the Ste@@ ady state ( C@@ min , ss ) affected by food intake , although the simultaneous intake of food influences the scale and rate of res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
the seem@@ ing distribution volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be adjusted to a large distribution volume as well as a tremendous penetration of Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r from the blo@@ od@@ stream into the tissues .
&quot; this change leads to a acceptance of the total concentration of the drug in plasma , with the amount of un@@ bund@@ led Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r that remains the active part , probably remains unchanged . &quot;

&quot; the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r @-@ exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r is out of the solution 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore are as@@ gener@@ ase solution and as@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram@@ m@@ base .
&quot; the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also negl@@ ected , therefore the impact of a kid@@ ney disease is likely to be low on the elimination of Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;

24 If as@@ gener@@ ase capsules without the increased rate of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ stery ) must be applied higher doses at A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for ather@@ ase capsules is 20 mg Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r / kg body@@ weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines to a daily basis of 2400 mg Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r which should not be exce@@ eded ( see section 5.1 ) .

&quot; a lecturer for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it is not recommended for eng@@ aging surveillance because the effectiveness and im@@ itation of this combination is not known . &quot;
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ ence in combination with Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both Prot@@ e@@ as@@ par@@ mer would be low .
&quot; if these medicines will be applied together , caution is offered ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ cal surveillance should be made , as a precise predi@@ ction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din difficult . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin along with ather@@ ase , to reduce the dosage of Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there are no clinical data . &quot;

the in@@ convenience of as@@ gener@@ a was examined in adults and in children from 4 years in controlled clinical studies in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al drugs .
&quot; in case of over@@ dos@@ ing , the patient is observed on signs of an in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , are necessary suppor@@ tive measures to be included . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ vir@@ al activity of Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was examined both in ac@@ utely and chron@@ ically infected cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peri@@ pher@@ al ble@@ eder . &quot;

&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r re@@ tains its activity against some other proteins in isolation ; the preservation of these activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in isolation . &quot;
&quot; based on these data , the treatment of therapy with PI pre @-@ treated children should be considered to be estimated of &quot; un@@ geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ated &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;

&quot; additionally , because no dosage recommendation for simultaneous use of as@@ gener@@ ase solution can be taken and low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be avoided , this combination can be avoided by these patients . &quot;

the application condition and duration of treatment with Al@@ dara depend on the treating disease in the genital area is Al@@ dara up to a maximum of 16 weeks long three times per week . • With me@@ tic@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ses it is during one or two four @-@ week treatment cycles , with four weeks break between the treatment cycles , three times weekly . &quot;
the cream is in front of the bed@@ side th@@ inner on the affected skin surfaces so that they remain enough for a long time ( about eight hours ) on the skin so they washed away .
&quot; in all studies al@@ dara was compared with a plac@@ ebo ( same cre@@ ams , but without the ingre@@ dient ) compared . • Al@@ dara was tested in four main studies on 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks long . &quot;
main indic@@ ative for the effectiveness was the number of patients with complete dis@@ healing of the patients treated . • Al@@ dara was also treated to 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma in two studies where patients were treated for six weeks and al@@ dara or plac@@ ebo either daily or five times a week .
main indi@@ ct@@ ator for the effectiveness was the number of patients with complete dis@@ healing of tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dara was also tested in two studies in total 505 patients with ak@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis .
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dara was more effective than plac@@ ebo . • With the treatment of self @-@ treated patients , but only 3 % to 18 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo patients . • The results of the two studies are treated in Bas@@ al@@ cell patients compared to 0 % to 3 % in the plac@@ ebo group . &quot;
the most common side effects of Al@@ dara ( observed at more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions of the use of cre@@ ams of cream or itch .
&quot; clin@@ ically typical , not hyper@@ sol@@ itary @-@ otic , not hyper@@ trop@@ hic ker@@ at@@ osis ( A@@ KS ) in the face or on the scal@@ p in the competent adults , if the size or the acceptance of the l@@ esi@@ ons limit effectiveness and / or the acceptance of a cry@@ otherapy , and other top@@ ical treatment options are con@@ train@@ dic@@ apped or less suitable . &quot;

&quot; treatment with I@@ mi@@ qui@@ od cream is so long to continue until all the visible F@@ eig@@ n in the genital area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period . &quot;
&quot; a break in the above treatment process should be weigh@@ ed , if intensive local infl@@ amm@@ ation actions occur ( see Section 4.4 ) or if the treatment area is observed an infection . &quot;
&quot; when the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment times the l@@ esi@@ ons are only in@@ complete cured , a different therapy should be started ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; when a dose was dropped , the patient pushed the cream , once he / she noticed this and then proceed with the usual therapy plan . &quot;
I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od Cre@@ am is fed up in a thin layer and in the framed skin area to ru@@ b to the cream completely de@@ du@@ cted .
&quot; in case of these patients , it should be carried out between the benefits of a treatment with i@@ mi@@ qui@@ od , and with a possible wor@@ sen@@ ing of its auto@@ immune disease . &quot;
&quot; it should be carried out in case of these patients , between the benefits of a treatment with i@@ mi@@ qui@@ od , and with a possible organ@@ ig@@ nition or GRA@@ FT @-@ versus @-@ NAS risk . &quot;
&quot; in other studies , in which no daily Vor@@ al@@ auth@@ y@@ san@@ e was conducted , two cases of severe ph@@ im@@ osis were observed and one case with one to the circum@@ cis@@ ion of leading cor@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; when using I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od Cre@@ ams in higher than the recommended doses is an increased risk to severe local skin irrit@@ ations ( see Section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , the treatment was required and / or have led to an temporarily bodi@@ ly imp@@ air@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions at the output of the ureth@@ ra came up , some women had difficulties in the water@@ ing , which made an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and a treatment of the affected area . &quot;
&quot; for the application of I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od Cre@@ me immediately following an treatment with other k@@ ut@@ an app@@ lic@@ ated means for the treatment of external fo@@ rest@@ ling in the genital and peri@@ pher@@ ds , so far there are no clinical experience . &quot;
&quot; limited data might suggest an increased rate of po@@ inter reduction in HIV @-@ positive patients , I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od cream , has shown a lower effectiveness in this patient group regarding the removal of the po@@ inters however . &quot;
&quot; the treatment of the Bas@@ al@@ cell car@@ cin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od within 1 cm around the eyel@@ ids , the nose , the lips or the hair@@ line was not examined . &quot;
local assets are common but the intensity of this reaction takes place in general while therapy or the reactions form after the completion of the treatment with I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od cream .
&quot; if it is necessary because of the discomfort of the patient or due to the sever@@ ity of the local hood actions , a treatment of treatment can be done by several days . &quot;
the clinical results of therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin around 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
&quot; there is currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after treatment , should be considered at super@@ fi@@ zi@@ els Bas@@ al@@ cell car@@ cin@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ C@@ s are not a clinical experience , therefore the application is not recommended for previously @-@ treated tum@@ ors . &quot;
data from an open clinical study point out that with large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) is a lower probability of response to the I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od therapy .
&quot; I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od was not tested for the treatment of ak@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ants , inside the nose or the ears or on the lip area inside the Li@@ p ots . &quot;
there are only very limited data on the application of I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od for treatment ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis to anatom@@ ical places outside the face and the scal@@ p .
&quot; the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ical ker@@ at@@ osis on the under@@ poor and hands support the effectiveness in this application , therefore , such application will not be recommended . &quot;
local min@@ uses frequently occur but these reactions normally take over the course of treatment to intensity or go back after lowering the therapy with i@@ mi@@ quim@@ od cream .
&quot; if the local people cause great discomfort or are very strong , the treatment can be exposed for several days . &quot;
&quot; from the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 AK@@ - l@@ esi@@ ons to lower complete healing rate as patients with less than 8 l@@ esi@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; due to the imm@@ ac@@ ulate properties , I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od Cre@@ me should be used with caution in patients who received an immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; animal studies have no direct or indirect effect on the pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / f@@ öt@@ land development , perf@@ ume or the post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;

the initial inf@@ usion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient is toler@@ ated every 15 minutes by a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
&quot; the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years was not determined , and for these patients no dos@@ ing scheme may be recommended . &quot;
&quot; the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is not determined in patients with kid@@ ney or liver in@@ suff@@ iciency , and for these patients cannot be recommended any dos@@ ing scheme . &quot;
&quot; with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me patients , patients can develop @-@ conditioned reactions which are defined as any related side effect , which occurs during the inf@@ usion or until the end of the influ@@ enza ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be monitored , and the inf@@ usion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be made available in a reasonable clinical environment , in the re@@ vit@@ alizing facilities for medical emergen@@ cies . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase @-@ 3 study is expected that nearly all patients are Ig@@ G @-@ antibodies against lar@@ oni@@ da@@ se , usually within 3 months from treatment . &quot;
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction will have to be treated with caution at the application of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; as little experience in the recovery of treatment after a longer break , due to the theoretical risk of an over@@ sensitivity , must be cau@@ tioned after a dis@@ ruption of the treatment . &quot;
60 minutes before the start of inf@@ usion with medications ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ine and / or anti @-@ Py@@ re@@ tica ) to minim@@ ize the potential occurrence @-@ related reactions .
&quot; in the event of an easy or indirect inf@@ usion reaction to treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ine and acet@@ amin@@ op@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or reducing the inf@@ usion rate to half of the inf@@ usion rate , in which the reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a single , heavy inf@@ usion reaction to inf@@ usion have to be stopped until the symptoms are brought to decline , treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ine and et@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is considering . &quot;
inf@@ usion can be performed with a reduction of inf@@ usion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the inf@@ usion rate in which the reaction occurred .

the side effects in clinical studies were attributed mainly as inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions which have been observed at 53 % of patients in phase 3 @-@ 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and at 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
unwanted medicines associated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me who have been observed during the period of 5 years or older at a treatment duration of up to 4 years of age are listed in the following table following : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
&quot; in some patients with severe MP@@ S @-@ I @-@ related participation of the upper air@@ ways and lung in the pre@@ history , in addition , heavy reactions appeared , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ mus , respir@@ atory and fac@@ ial . ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children in@@ quired drugs associated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me who have been reported during a Ph@@ as@@ e- 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with mainly severe per@@ missible form and treatment duration up to 12 months , reported are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous once a week , 200 E / kg in@@ trav@@ en@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg in@@ trav@@ en@@ ously every two weeks . &quot;
&quot; during most patients there were within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment to a ser@@ oc@@ on@@ version , whereby it came to patients aged under 5 years with a he@@ avier or@@ atory form ( average of 26 days compared to 45 days for patients aged 5 years and older ) . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the phase 3 study ( or up to an early retirement from the study ) , at 13 / 45 patients were not recommended by radio@@ immun@@ opath@@ ic acid ( Rip ) As@@ say trac@@ eable antibodies before , among which there were never to ser@@ oc@@ on@@ version . &quot;
patients with faul@@ ts and low antibodies are a robust reduction in the G@@ AG in the Har@@ n while in case of patients with high antibodies form a variable reduction of G@@ AG in the har@@ n .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study ) showed a margin@@ ale to low neutr@@ ality inhi@@ bit@@ or@@ ic effect on enzym@@ atic Lar@@ oni@@ da@@ se@@ - activity in vit@@ ro which seemed to not imp@@ air the clinical effic@@ acy and / or reducing G@@ AG in the Har@@ n .
&quot; the presence of antibodies seemed to be related to the incidence of unwanted drugs , even if the appearance of unwanted drugs , typically coinci@@ des with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies . &quot;
the reason for the enzym@@ es therapy lies in one for the hydro@@ lys@@ is of the accum@@ ulated substr@@ ate and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient amounts of the enzym@@ es .
&quot; after in@@ trav@@ en@@ visi@@ er Inf@@ usion , Lar@@ oni@@ da@@ se is rapidly removed from the circul@@ atory and recorded cells into the Ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely via Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a rand@@ om@@ ized , double @-@ blind , plac@@ eb@@ ok@@ on@@ controlled phase @-@ 3 study on 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years . &quot;
&quot; although patients were re@@ affirm@@ ed for the study , which was re@@ affirm@@ ed the entire disease spectrum , was the majority of patients from the Middle phen@@ otype and only one patient proved to be severe phen@@ otype . &quot;
&quot; patients were en@@ rolled if they had a for@@ c@@ ized exp@@ ir@@ ator volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters . &quot;
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage of the FE@@ V and the absolute walking distance in the 6 @-@ min@@ ut@@ - p@@ ht@@ est .
&quot; all patients were subsequently approved for an open @-@ label extension , where they received another 3,5 years ( 182 weeks ) every week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
after 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me patients across the plac@@ ebo group an improvement of the pul@@ mon@@ ary function and the ability to display in the following table .
an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and of 182 weeks in plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as shown from the following table .
the acceptance of the percentage of the percentage of the FE@@ V is not significant about this period of clin@@ ically not significant and the absolute lung @-@ vol@@ um@@ ina increased further propor@@ tionally to the body of growing children .
&quot; of the 26 patients with a he@@ pati@@ os , nuclear treatment reached 22 ( 85 % ) until the end of the study was a normal living size . &quot;
within the first 4 weeks a significant waste of G@@ AG @-@ Spiegel in the Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) was established until the study is constant .
&quot; with regard to the hetero@@ geneous path@@ ogen , the clin@@ ically significant changes took into account , the clin@@ ically significant changes introduced for five effic@@ acy variable ( 58 % ) , in general an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration of 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
&quot; it was conducted a one year @-@ year @-@ 2 study conducted in which mainly the security and Phar@@ mak@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was examined , which were conducted at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with heavy delay form and 4 with the middle floor form ) . &quot;
&quot; for four patients , the dosage is increased because of higher G@@ AG@@ - mirror in the har@@ n in week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg . &quot;
&quot; in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight increase ( n = 3 ) , after the Z @-@ Score ( &lt; 2.5 years ) , and all 4 patients with the middle @-@ term form , however , on the older patients with severe damage form only limited or no advances in the cog@@ nitive development were determined . &quot;
in a phase 4 study studies were conducted on pharmac@@ od@@ ynam@@ ic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me @-@ Do@@ or@@ schem@@ ata at the G@@ AG @-@ Spiegel in the Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute poem . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous once a week , 200 E / kg in@@ trav@@ en@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg in@@ trav@@ en@@ ously every two weeks . &quot;
&quot; the dos@@ ing scheme with 200 E / kg in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous every 2 weeks may be in patients who have difficulties with weekly Inf@@ usions , but is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effic@@ acy of these two dos@@ ing schem@@ ata is equal . &quot;

the transformation of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in its active form goes easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells that leads to higher concentr@@ ations of the active form of drugs by means of a longer term duration of cancer cells .
&quot; for the treatment of mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ oms A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study of 456 patients who had previously received any chemotherapy against their disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ fat lung cancer the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were treated with a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disorder , which previously had previously been treated with chemotherapy ( other medicines against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta has also been compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ in ( a further medicine against cancer ) , and although both in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin in a study conducted in 1 725 patients who had previously received any chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;

at the beginning of a new treatment cycle a dosage check must take place under considerations - of the N@@ adi@@ rs blood image or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity of the pre@@ ge@@ - h@@ ensive therap@@ ie@@ cycles .
&quot; after relaxation , patients must be treated according to the references in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for AL@@ IM@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria meet the definition of National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity C@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 ble@@ eding .
&quot; should patients not develop @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ≥ degrees 3 ( except ne@@ oto@@ x@@ icity ) , the therapy has to be interrupted with AL@@ IM@@ TA until the patient has the value before treatment
&quot; the treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be broken when in case of patients after 2 dosage reduction , any hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity , or non @-@ domestic tox@@ icity degree 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - fort the occurrence of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ oto@@ x@@ icity . &quot;
clinical studies have no indication that in patients aged 65 the ages of 65 Jah@@ - or compared to patients aged 65 years is an increased side of side @-@ ag@@ i@@ - ko .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to non @-@ irrit@@ ability data for in@@ convenience and effectiveness .
clinical trials were necessary in patients with an Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min no dos@@ ages necessary for all patients recommended dosage adjustments .
the data base in patients with an Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance of under 45 ml / min was not adequate ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
however patients with a liver cir@@ cl@@ ent@@ angl@@ ement of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - boar@@ der value and / or tran@@ sam@@ at@@ ase values of &gt; the 3.@@ 0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ) or &gt; 5,@@ 0 @-@ fold of the upper limits ) are not specifically examined in the studies .
patients must be monitored with regard to the Kno@@ wing mark@@ ers and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must not be admini@@ stered to patients before their absolute ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ du@@ en@@ ings again has a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ - cy@@ ten@@ ders has reached a value of ≥ 100.000 cells / mm ³ .
&quot; a dosage reduction for further cycles based on the N@@ adir of the absolute Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ du@@ en@@ ings , Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ ten@@ ement and maximum non @-@ domestic tox@@ icity , as it observed in the preceding treatment cycles - the ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
a lower tox@@ icity and a reduction of the degree 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity and infection with degree 3 / 4 ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ y was be@@ amed if a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
&quot; therefore , all patients have to be used with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed patients , fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a preventive measure to reduce tox@@ icity ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with light to medium kid@@ ney in@@ suff@@ iciency ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 up to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous intake of non@@ ster@@ o@@ id anti@@ ph@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ c acid ( &gt; 1.4 g daily ) for a minimum of 2 days before the treatment of treatment and mind@@ set - TEN@@ S 2 days after treatment with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; all patients , intended for therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , need to avoid N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with a long half @-@ time limit for at least 5 days before treatment , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients who came up these events had appropriate risk factors for the appearance of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre@@ dict@@ ated hyper@@ tension or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant hydr@@ ation - accumulation in the trans@@ cell@@ ul@@ ary room a det@@ ox of the ergometer before the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment will be weigh@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; 5 serious cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ din@@ ary events , and zer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cul@@ osis events were reported in clinical studies with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed occasionally , when this ingre@@ dient is usually admini@@ stered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated life @-@ ste@@ els ( except yellow @-@ fe@@ ver , this vacc@@ ination is con@@ train@@ dic@@ ated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible spongiform encephal@@ opathy , men should be pointed out before the treatment - g@@ inn to get advice on the sperm volume . &quot;
&quot; in patients with conventional kid@@ ney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses can lead in high doses ( ≥ 1.6 mg / day ) and Ac@@ et@@ yl@@ es@@ ic@@ yl@@ acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1.1 g daily ) to a reduced P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed Ret@@ ention with the result of a multip@@ ly rise of side effects . &quot;
therefore caution is provided when in patients with normal kid@@ ney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or Ac@@ e- t@@ yl@@ es@@ ic@@ yl@@ ic acid in high dosage .
&quot; I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or Ac@@ et@@ yl@@ es@@ ic@@ yl@@ - acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before treatment , on the day of therapy and mind@@ set - TEN@@ S 2 days after treatment with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no data to be avoided as with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long semi @-@ value as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or Ro@@ f@@ ec@@ ox@@ i@@ b , the simultaneous application must be avoided for at least 5 days before treatment , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - mixed . &quot;
the big in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the t@@ inn@@ ate status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between or@@ ality anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International Standards ratio ) when deciding to treat patients with or@@ tal anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; there are no data for the use of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in pregnant , but as with an@@ de@@ - ren an@@ tim@@ ber@@ ites are expected during an application in the pregnancy heavy birth effect . &quot;
&quot; p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must not be used during pregnancy , except if necessarily , and after careful absorption of the farm for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible injuries by p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be pointed out before the treatment course , advice on the sperm count . &quot;
it is not known if p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed reads to the mother &apos;s milk and unwanted effects in the breast@@ feeding inf@@ ant can not be excluded .

the lik@@ eli@@ hood of the wor@@ ding gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) can increase if alli gains taken together with a fine @-@ fat or obes@@ e diet .
&quot; since the weight reduction in diabetes can be found in diabetes with an improved met@@ abolic control , patients who consult a medicine against diabetes before starting a therapy with alli gains a doctor or pharmac@@ ist , because the dosage of the anti@@ di@@ abe@@ tics may be adapted . &quot;

the side effects of Or@@ list@@ at are mainly gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal nature and hang out with the phar@@ yn@@ ge@@ ological effect of the drug by means of the absorption of classified fat .
the gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal side effects were obtained from clinical studies with Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally easy and temporarily .

&quot; two double @-@ blind , rand@@ om@@ ized , plac@@ om@@ ized studies in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 occupy the effectiveness of 60 mg of Or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times daily in combination with a hy@@ po@@ kal@@ ine , fet@@ al diet . &quot;
&quot; primary parameters , change in body weight towards the output ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ isation ) , was evaluated as follows : as change in the body weight in the study course ( table 1 ) and as percentage of those study participants , which have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their starting weight ( table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although in both studies the weight reduction has been observed over 12 months , the biggest weight loss occurred within the first 6 months . &quot;
the average change in the overall cholester@@ in was with Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2,@@ 4 % ( source value 5,@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( output rating 5,@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;

&quot; Alo@@ xi is used for chemotherapy , which are strong trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( like Cis@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as in chemotherapy , the excessive trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting are ( like Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be inserted through the additional G@@ abe of a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids ( a drug that can be used as anti@@ em@@ e@@ tic ) .
&quot; the application in patients under the age of 18 is not recommended , since the effects in this age group is not enough information . &quot;
&quot; this means that the active substance prevents the bond of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ try@@ pt@@ amine ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ine . &quot;
Alo@@ xi was examined in three main studies at 1 842 adults who received chemotherapy which strong or moderate de@@ emer for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting are .
&quot; with chemotherapy , a strong trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , showed 59 % of the patients who have been treated with Alo@@ xi , in 24 hours of chemotherapy ( 132 of 223 ) , compared to 57 % of patients with On@@ dan@@ ger@@ ron @-@ treated patients ( 126 of 221 ) . &quot;
&quot; for chemotherapy , the excessive dis@@ sol@@ vers for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , showed 81 % of the patients treated with Alo@@ xi , in 24 hours of chemotherapy ( 153 of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients with On@@ dan@@ ger@@ ron treated patients ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
when compared with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values at 63 % for alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
March 2005 passed the European Commission of Helsinki Bi@@ rex Pharmaceu@@ ticals Ltd . a permit for the evaluation of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union .
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : in preventing medicine and v@@ om@@ iting at strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and v@@ om@@ iting for a cancer disease and v@@ om@@ iting with moderate chemotherapy according to cancer .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi to the prevention of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting that is in@@ duced by a strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy may be reinforced by adding an before chemotherapy given the Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids .
&quot; since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron extend the col@@ on of col@@ on , patients should be monitored with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ al Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a subtle I@@ le@@ us after injection . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ ag@@ onists , however , caution is advisable to extend the Q@@ T @-@ Inter@@ v@@ all or in patients where the Q@@ T @-@ Inter@@ v@@ all is extended or prolon@@ ged to such a extension . &quot;
&quot; except in connection with another chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi is supposed to be used neither in the days of chemotherapy nor for treatment of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting . &quot;
in pre@@ clinical studies inhi@@ bit@@ te Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron not viol@@ ated the activity of the five under@@ taking chemotherapy ( Cis@@ pl@@ atin , Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ ated , Cy@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ omy@@ cin C ) . &quot;
in a clinical study did not prove a significant pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic inter@@ play between a unique in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous dose Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a ste@@ ady met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ am@@ ids , a CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; in a population @-@ based phar@@ oc@@ ine@@ tic analysis was shown that the simultaneous lat@@ ency of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , Ch@@ lo@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , K@@ oper@@ e@@ tin , Ch@@ ini@@ din , R@@ ini@@ din , R@@ ini@@ ć and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; experiences regarding the application of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies will not be used , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant , unless it is necessary by the patient doctor . &quot;
in clinical studies the most common with a dose of 250 micro@@ grams to watched side effects ( overall 633 patients ) which at least possibly with alo@@ xi in the context stood , he@@ ada@@ che ( 9 % ) and Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of over@@ sensitivity , dis@@ curing , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experiences . &quot;
in the group with the highest doses showed themselves similar cases of unwanted events such as in the other dos@@ ing groups ; there were no dose @-@ active relationships to observe .
&quot; however , no di@@ aly@@ sis studies have been carried out due to the large distribution of distribution is a di@@ aly@@ sis , however , probably no effective treatment at a Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dos@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; in two rand@@ om@@ ized twin @-@ blind@@ ed studies were a total of 1.@@ 132 patients , which was a moderate chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg of Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ hour ) or 100 mg of Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ hour ) , which was given to day 1 without den@@ om@@ eth@@ ason in@@ trav@@ en@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; in a rand@@ om@@ ized double @-@ blind , the overall 667 patients were obtained with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ Cis@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1.500 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ ates , and 250 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ ates , with patients compared to the 32 mg On@@ dan@@ ger@@ ron , which were given to day 1 in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous . &quot;
the results of the studies with medium chemical chemotherapy and the study involving strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summar@@ ized in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical studies on the indications of chemotherapy in@@ duced exercise and v@@ om@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) were the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters , including the Q@@ T@@ c @-@ Inter@@ v@@ alls , comparable with the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ ger@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; according to the formal investigations of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to blo@@ cking at the v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and re@@ mobili@@ zation involved , and pro@@ long the duration of the action potential . &quot;
the aim of the study carried out by 221 healthy Pro@@ ban@@ den study was the evaluation of the EC@@ G effects of i.@@ v. admini@@ stered Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single @-@ p@@ ants of 0.25 , 0,@@ 75 and 0.4 mg . &quot;
&quot; res@@ or@@ ption by in@@ trav@@ en@@ visi@@ er G@@ abe follows an initi@@ ale absorption of the Plas@@ mac@@ on@@ centr@@ ations , a slow elimination of the body with an average date of tempor@@ al half @-@ time period of about 40 hours . &quot;
the average maximum plastic Con@@ centr@@ ation ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentr@@ ations @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C0@@ - ) are generally in the whole dosage range of 0.7 90 μ @-@ kg / kg with Heal@@ thy and cancer patients .
after in@@ trav@@ en@@ ös@@ er gift from Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 2 mg every second day for a total of 3 cans were of 11 Ho@@ den@@ kar@@ zin@@ om@@ pati@@ os between day 1 and day 5 measured intermediate ( ± SD ) increase in Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron @-@ Plas@@ mac@@ on@@ centr@@ ation at 42 ± 34 % .
&quot; from pharmac@@ ological sim@@ ulations pro@@ gres@@ sed , that at once daily in@@ trav@@ en@@ visi@@ er gene rose to 3 consecutive days of total tex@@ tured ( AU@@ C0@@ - ) with which after one @-@ time in@@ trav@@ en@@ visi@@ er administration was comparable ; however , the C@@ max after the addition of 0.7 mg was higher . &quot;
&quot; approximately 40 % are eliminated over the kid@@ neys , and some more 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ abolic ites , which have compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron over less than 1 % of the ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on 5@@ HT@@ 3 recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; in @-@ vit@@ ro studies for met@@ abolic ization have shown that CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in executed measurements , the I@@ so@@ enz@@ y@@ me CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
Eli@@ mination After an in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found about 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in the urine . Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a unique in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous bol@@ ting of Heal@@ thy was the overall bodi@@ ly 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
&quot; although in patients with severe he@@ aters , the tempor@@ al elimination of the termin@@ ale eli@@ p in@@ tim@@ id@@ ation and the average system@@ ic ex@@ position increases with pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , however , a reduction of the dose is not justified . &quot;
clinical studies have been observed only after ex@@ positions which are considered adequate for the maximum humane therapeutic exposure which indicates a low relevance for clinical use .
10 From the clinical studies took note that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can block only in very high concentr@@ ations of I@@ on@@ asi@@ es channels and extend to the v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ grad@@ ation and re@@ polar@@ isation and extend the action of action .
&quot; high doses of Pal@@ ony Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( every dose of correspon@@ dent in approximately the 30@@ ,000 of the therapeutic ex@@ position in humans ) which were given every day over two years , led to a multip@@ ly frequency of Leb@@ ert@@ um@@ iors , endo@@ ophy@@ sis , pan@@ cre@@ as , an@@ cer@@ n@@ en@@ en@@ mark ) and skin @-@ tum@@ ors with rats , but not at mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not completely known , but due to the high doses , and since Alo@@ xi is determined when people use a unique application , the relevance of these results will be minor for people . &quot;
the owner of this approval for the agent needs to inform the European Commission about the plans for the market in the framework of this decision by means of drugs .

&quot; furthermore , concerns have expressed concerns that the data on the stability of the drug and the market @-@ market drugs have not been eliminated . &quot;
&quot; the number of patients with he@@ pati@@ tis C , who spoke to the treatment with Alp@@ he@@ on and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A speeches , was similar in clinical trial . &quot;
&quot; after setting the treatment with Alp@@ he@@ on flame retar@@ ded the disease in more patients back than with reference quart@@ z ; moreover , Alp@@ he@@ on had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from that , the drug was introduced in the study on the study of the question , to what extent the drug forms an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins , against the drug ) , not sufficiently vali@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; it can be applied to the treatment of Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( one with cr@@ ush @-@ school skin infection ) and small in@@ infected Laz@@ er@@ ations ( risk or cutting ) , amor@@ tization and se@@ wn wo@@ unds . &quot;
Al@@ tar@@ go is not intended to treat infections caused by meth@@ yl@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ cus t@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because al@@ ar@@ go against this kind of infections may not affect .
&quot; al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients from the age of nine months , but patients under 18 may not exceed 2 % of the body surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient talks about two or three days not to treat the patient , the doctor should consider the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works through block@@ ing of bacterial cells ( the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced ) and inhi@@ bits the growth of bacteria .
main indic@@ ative of the effectiveness was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was de@@ du@@ cted after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of the 139 patients under al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2,@@ 1 % ) of 71 patients in plac@@ ebo on treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of infected walls , al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ efal@@ onia showed similar contact : when the results of both studies were picked up in front tw@@ ins , about 90 % of the patients of both groups on treatment . &quot;
&quot; however , in these two studies , however , that al@@ tar@@ go was observed in the treatment of ab@@ norm@@ ality ( vain @-@ filled hol@@ low spaces in the body tissue ) or of infections that were in@@ concei@@ vable or probably caused by MR@@ SA , are not effective enough . &quot;
the most common side @-@ effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which has been observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a stim@@ ulus to the order .
&quot; the committee for humanity ten@@ ants ( CH@@ MP ) had to conclude that the benefits of al@@ tar@@ go in the short @-@ time treatment of the following super@@ ficial skin infections compared to risks : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • in@@ infected small Laz@@ ations , de@@ ceased or se@@ wn wo@@ unds . &quot;
May 2007 passed the European Commission to the Gla@@ x@@ o Group Ltd . a permit for the transport of al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union .
patients who are no improvement within two to three days should be investigated once again and an alternative therapy will be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in the case of Sensi@@ tizing or serious local irrit@@ ation , due to the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ be the treatment has been abandoned , the sal@@ be carefully ref@@ used and an appropriate alternative treatment of infection started . &quot;
&quot; Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as re@@ stim@@ ulator , or is assumed ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
in clinical studies in secondary studies with secondary open wo@@ unds was the effectiveness of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by an meth@@ ill@@ ill@@ in resist@@ or for@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) were insufficient .
an alternative therapy is to be considered if after a 2- to 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or a deteri@@ oration of the infected body occurs .
the impact of simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical methods on the same skin area is not investigated and the simultaneous application of other top@@ ical drugs is not recommended .
&quot; due to the low plastic @-@ centr@@ ations , which were obtained when people were reached on top@@ ical application on di@@ ced skin or infected super@@ ficial wo@@ unds , is a clin@@ ically relevant inhi@@ bition in vi@@ vo not to expect ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
3 times a simultaneous gift of 2 @-@ times daily 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol increased the medium Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max after top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ be on the ground@@ ed skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
&quot; due to the low system@@ ic exposure to top@@ ical application in patients , dosage adjustments do not require for required when top@@ ical Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin used during a system@@ ic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a Re@@ production and in@@ adequate intake and are in@@ adequate concerning a statement on the effect on the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
&quot; Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ be should only be used during pregnancy , when a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indic@@ ating and the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin to be prefer@@ ential in the gift of a system@@ ic antibiotic . &quot;
&quot; in deciding whether the breast@@ feeding continued / termin@@ ated or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go continues to be completed , is between the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the al@@ tar@@ go therapy for women . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies of 2150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go was the most frequently reported side @-@ effect irrit@@ ation on the administration of meeting , which consider approximately 1 % of patients . &quot;
&quot; operation : Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ uro@@ cour@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that made by Ferm@@ entation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ er@@ anus ( formerly P@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ anus ) isolated . &quot;
the drug mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the sel@@ ective locking of bacterial synthesis through interaction at a specific bond of the bacterial unit of bacterial cells that diff@@ ers from the ties of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ ag@@ ony compounds .
data indicates that the bonds of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales Protein L@@ 3 involves and in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ bonds and the pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ring centre .

&quot; due to the local pre@@ val@@ ence of the Resi@@ st@@ ence of the Resi@@ stance , the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin appear in at least some inf@@ ectious forms , should be a consultation by experts . &quot;
&quot; there were no differences in the In @-@ vit@@ ro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isolation was sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in case of an un@@ appealing to the treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes should be considered with additional vir@@ ul@@ enz@@ tors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) . &quot;

the sampling took place at the days 3 or 4 in adults each before the medication and in children between 0 @-@ 12 hours following the last application .

&quot; Ambi@@ rix is used to protect he@@ pati@@ tis A and he@@ pati@@ tis B ( diseases , which are applied to the liver with children aged between one and 15 years that are not im@@ mu@@ n against these two diseases . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix is applied within the framework of a two doses of existing vacc@@ ines , whereby a protection against he@@ pati@@ tis B may only be achieved after administration of the second dose . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if the immun@@ isation exists a low risk of a Hepatitis B infection and is ensured that the vacc@@ ines can be brought to an end of two doses at the end . &quot;
if a refres@@ hing dose against he@@ pati@@ tis A or B is desired , am@@ rix or another he@@ pati@@ tis A@@ - or B vaccine will be given . &quot;
vacc@@ ines act by bringing the immune system ( the natural def@@ le of the body ) as it can be against a disease .
&quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system det@@ ects the viruses and surface anti@@ gens than &quot; foreign &quot; and generates antibodies against it . &quot;
ambi@@ rix contains the same ingredients such as the vaccine vaccine Twin@@ rix adults and who has been corro@@ bor@@ ated since 1997 Twin@@ rix children since 1997 .
&quot; the three vacc@@ ines are applied to the protection against the same diseases , however , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are admini@@ stered under one of three doses existing vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data , which uses the application of Twin@@ rix adults , also used as cover for use of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main inde@@ b@@ ator for the effectiveness was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had a month after the last injection .
&quot; in an additional study with 208 children , the effectiveness of the vaccine has been compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two inj@@ ections . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix resulted in between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children one month after the last injection to the development of protective antibodies against he@@ pati@@ tis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of am@@ rix at a six @-@ month and at a 12 @-@ month distance between inj@@ ections similar was .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed at more than 1 of 10 vacc@@ ines ) are he@@ ada@@ che , appeti@@ zer , pain in the injection , red@@ ness , mat@@ eness , mat@@ eness , mat@@ eness , mat@@ eness , and irrit@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix may act in patients who may possibly be hy@@ pers@@ ensi@@ tive ( allergic ) to the agents , one of the other components or ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) will not be applied . &quot;
August 2002 passed the European Commission to the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ icals s.@@ a. a permit for the transport system of Ambi@@ rix in the entire
the stand@@ ardis@@ ation plan for the prim@@ ro@@ i@@ ari@@ zation with am@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines with the first dose of the date of choice and the second dose is admini@@ stered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a refres@@ hing creation is desired for he@@ pati@@ tis A as well as for he@@ pati@@ tis B can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al vacc@@ ines or with a combination of combin@@ able vacc@@ ines .
the anti @-@ he@@ pati@@ isation of anti @-@ he@@ pati@@ tis with the Com@@ bination of anti @-@ he@@ pati@@ tis ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ he@@ pati@@ tis @-@ A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) anti@@ den@@ ial values are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al vacc@@ ines .
&quot; it is still not completely secured , whether immun@@ o@@ competent persons who have addressed to a he@@ pati@@ tis A@@ - vacc@@ ination , since they are also protected by no longer rep@@ ectable antibodies as they are protected by the immun@@ ological memory . &quot;
3 As with all inj@@ ectors for the rare case of an an@@ aph@@ yl@@ ac@@ tic reaction after the gift of the vaccine would always be available immediately for medical treatment and monitoring .
&quot; if a rapid protection against he@@ pati@@ tis B is required , the stand@@ ardis@@ ed sch@@ ema is recommended by the Com@@ bination he@@ pati@@ tis @-@ A @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant pati@@ tis B @-@ B surface . &quot;
&quot; at Hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , the prim@@ acy of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ BS anti@@ body is achieved so that in these cases the gift of further vacc@@ ines may be necessary . &quot;
because a in@@ tra@@ der@@ mal injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration in the gl@@ utt@@ mus@@ cul@@ ature could lead to an subtle im@@ pregn@@ ation that these inj@@ ections should be avoided .
&quot; in Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ie or blo@@ od@@ ine disorders , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected , however , since it can occur in these cases to in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ ular g@@ abe . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix was admini@@ stered in the second life year in the form of a separate injection - , in@@ activated pol@@ om@@ yel@@ i@@ tis@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us , enz@@ ae type b vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with a combined Mas@@ ern@@ - M@@ umps @-@ vaccine was admini@@ stered ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune def@@ ect , it must be understood that perhaps not sufficient immune response will be achieved . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study that was conducted with 3 vacc@@ ines of these formulation , was the frequency of pain , red@@ ness , sw@@ elling , gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ i@@ tis , he@@ ada@@ ches and fe@@ ver comparable with the frequency , which has been observed in former Thi@@ om@@ ers@@ al@@ - and preser@@ v@@ ous vaccine . &quot;
in clinical studies the drug vacc@@ ines were admini@@ stered at the age of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ inations at the age of 1 and including 15 years .
in a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 and 15 years the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ cans of composite si@@ p@@ ants .
&quot; only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and mat@@ icity on a comp@@ ut@@ ational basis for a tax base per vacc@@ ination , however not on a comp@@ ut@@ ational base per person . &quot;
pain was observed after the Gift of Ambi@@ rix at 50.@@ 7 % of the Pro@@ ban@@ den , compared to 39,@@ 1 % in the pro@@ pul@@ den after the gift of a dose of 3 @-@ cans of combination . &quot;
&quot; after the complete vacc@@ ination reported 66,@@ 4 % of the Pro@@ ban@@ den , received the am@@ rix not enough about pain , compared to 6@@ 3.6 % with the Pro@@ ban@@ den , which was vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dos@@ - Com@@ bin@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of Mat@@ ia was however pro @-@ band comparable ( d. h. the entire vacc@@ ination at 39,@@ 6 % of the Pro@@ ban@@ den , compared with 36,@@ 2 % among the pro@@ ban@@ den , which received the 3 @-@ cans of combination ratio ) . &quot;
the frequency of pre@@ determined pain and sail@@ ing@@ fulness was low and comparable that has been observed after administration of the combination of combination with the 3 @-@ cans @-@ vacc@@ sch@@ ema .
&quot; in a compar@@ ative study of 1- to 11 @-@ year vacc@@ lingen , the appearance of local actions and general interactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ can group was comparable to that in administration with the 3 @-@ cans of combination with 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated carbon @-@ B @-@ surface @-@ surface . &quot;
&quot; however , at the 6@@ - until 11@@ - J@@ ol@@ ds , however , after vacc@@ ination with am@@ rix was a frequent appearance of pain ( on the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band . &quot;
&quot; the share of vaccine which reported via serious side effects during the 2 @-@ cans vaccine with am@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ cans vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated carbon @-@ A @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ able he@@ pati@@ tis , was statis@@ tically not different . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies , which were carried out at vacc@@ inations at the age of 1 to 15 years , the ser@@ oc@@ ul@@ sion rates were carried out for anti @-@ H@@ AV 99@@ ,@@ 1 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to month 6 far@@ ed dose ( d. h. month 7 ) . &quot;
the seri@@ ousness rates for anti @-@ H@@ BS were 7@@ 4.7 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second one month 6 far@@ ed dose ( d. h. month 7 ) .
&quot; 7 In a compar@@ ative study that was carried out at 12@@ - until including 15 @-@ year @-@ ol@@ ds , 142 two doses were Ambi@@ rix and 147 the standard combinations with three doses . &quot;
&quot; with the 289 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ icity was dict@@ able , were the seri@@ op@@ rot@@ ary rates ( SP in the table below ) against he@@ pati@@ tis B in the month 2 and 6 to G@@ abe des 3 @-@ Dos@@ en@@ im@@ pf@@ ile , significantly higher than with am@@ rix . &quot;
the immune response that have been reached in a clinical comparison study on 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ ol@@ ds a month after ending the full vaccine series ( i.e. in month 7 ) are listed in the following table .
in both studies the vacc@@ ines were either a 2 @-@ cans vaccine with am@@ rix or a 3 cans of vaccine with a combination of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated carbon @-@ A @-@ virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ able he@@ pati@@ tis B @-@ B surface .
&quot; for persons who were at the time of Grun@@ di@@ m@@ mun@@ isation between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ BS antibodies over at least 24 months after the immun@@ ization with Ambi@@ rix is proven in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ month @-@ vacc@@ ines . &quot;
the immune response in this study was comparable to both anti@@ gens was comparable with which after vacc@@ ination of 3 cans with a combination of 360 cans with a combination of pneum@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ able he@@ pati@@ tis B @-@ B surface in a dosage volume of 0.5 ml was established .
in a clinical study at 12@@ - until including 15 @-@ year @-@ ol@@ ds could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ BS antibodies comparable to that in the 0 @-@ 12 months vacc@@ in@@ ema is comparable to that in the 0 @-@ 12 months vaccine .
&quot; when the first dose Ambi@@ rix starts at the same time with the collection of a combined di@@ ph@@ ther@@ ie@@ - , in@@ activated pol@@ om@@ yel@@ i@@ tis@@ - and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us , enz@@ ae type b @-@ vacc@@ inate ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) , or with the first dose of a combined mask @-@ M@@ umps @-@ vacc@@ ination was admini@@ stered was the immune response to all anti@@ gens . &quot;
&quot; a clinical study conducted with 3 cans of the current formulation in adults , showed for the current wor@@ ding similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ors and ser@@ oc@@ ular rates as for the former formulation . &quot;
the vaccine is both before and after the Res@@ us@@ aders with eye on et@@ wa@@ ders and / or physical @-@ visible changes .

if you are infected / your child before the administration of both vacc@@ ines am@@ rix already infected with he@@ pati@@ tis A@@ - or he@@ pati@@ tis virus ( although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill ) a vaccine may not prevent a disorder .

&quot; Ambi@@ rix may be given in these cases , but the immune response of these persons on the vacc@@ ination can not be adequate , so a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is . &quot;
21 S@@ agen you will take your doctor if you have taken / your child more medicines ( including those that you have received without prescription ) or if you have received / your child has been replaced or immun@@ og@@ lo@@ bul@@ ins ( antibodies ) / has or this is planned in the near future .
&quot; however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person therefore not protected against one or both he@@ pati@@ tis A and B viruses . &quot;
&quot; if another vaccine has to be given at the same time with am@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated in separate bodies and as different li@@ mbs at the same time . &quot;
&quot; if am@@ rix is admini@@ stered at the same time or just before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lo@@ bul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; usually , am@@ rix pigs or imp@@ lied women not admini@@ stered unless it is urgent need to be fought against he@@ pati@@ tis A and he@@ pati@@ tis B . &quot;
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
&quot; if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible . &quot;

am@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; on the basis of the data which have become known since the issu@@ ance of the first approval for the market , contracts der CH@@ MP believe that the benefit of the risk @-@ risk for Ambi@@ rix remains positive . &quot;
&quot; however , Ambi@@ rix was conducted only in a member state ( in the Netherlands for May 2003 ) , the available security data for this medicine is limited due to the low patient exposure . &quot;
am@@ mon@@ aps can also be used in patients aged over a month with in@@ complete en@@ um@@ ar def@@ ect or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ium transmis@@ sions ( brain damage as a result of high ammon@@ ium con@@ cent@@ ric ) in the pre@@ history .
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ e@@ aps - split into several individual p@@ ants to meals - down@@ lu@@ res , under the food mixed or over a gast@@ ro@@ ff i@@ esch@@ l@@ oth ( through the stomach into the stomach leader ) or a nas@@ al wall ( through the nose in the stomach leader ) admini@@ stered . &quot;
&quot; it was not a compar@@ ative study , as Am@@ mon@@ e@@ aps did not be compared with another treatment or with plac@@ ebo ( a pseu@@ do medi@@ ums , i.e. without drug ) . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps can also cause appeti@@ zer , an ab@@ nor@@ dic cleans@@ ing , he@@ ada@@ che , he@@ ada@@ ches , li@@ pos@@ uction , flav@@ ours , irrit@@ ation , irrit@@ ation , irrit@@ ation , irrit@@ ation , irrit@@ ation or counter@@ weight . &quot;
the committee for humanity ten@@ ants ( CH@@ MP ) had to conclude that Am@@ mon@@ aps in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle to high altitude gain effectively prevents .
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps was approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; as due to the rar@@ ity of the illness at the time of admission only limited information about this medicine . &quot;
&quot; the use is indi@@ ces in all patients , where a complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ man@@ gel has already manifest@@ ed in the new@@ born en@@ age ( within the first 28 life @-@ days ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a sp@@ ig@@ mani@@ fold form ( in@@ complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ def@@ ect , who mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first life of life ) then there is an indicator of the application when an@@ am@@ n@@ ese is a hyper@@ mi@@ tig@@ ic encephal@@ opathy . &quot;
&quot; for inf@@ ants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with gor@@ ges , AM@@ MONA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ulators . &quot;
the daily dose will be individually toler@@ ated taking into account the protein toler@@ ance and the necessary daily protein intake of the patient .
&quot; according to the previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of so@@ dium C@@ atri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight of 20 kg as well as with her@@ ent and adults . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients who suffer from such a fixed lack of car@@ b@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ats@@ yn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or organ cases , is the sub@@ stitution of C@@ itr@@ ul@@ lin or Ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0,@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,@@ 8 g / m ² / day . &quot;
patients with an Ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ uc@@ cin@@ yn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must be argin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8,@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MONA@@ PS tablets may not be admini@@ stered patients with gor@@ ges , since a risk for the emergence of o@@ soph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a consists of when the tablets are not immediately going into the stomach . &quot;
&quot; every tablet AM@@ MONA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium , according to 2,5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per 20 g so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
AM@@ MONA@@ PS should therefore be used in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive in@@ fertility or severe kid@@ ney in@@ suff@@ iciency as well as with n@@ atri@@ um re@@ tention and est@@ u@@ ating clinical trials only with caution .
&quot; since met@@ abolic and secre@@ tion of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate about the liver and the kid@@ neys , AM@@ MONA@@ PS should be applied in patients with liver or kid@@ ney failure . &quot;
the importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore con@@ train@@ dic@@ ated ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; with sub@@ cut@@ ted gift of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate at young rats ( 190 - 474 mg / kg ) it came to a slow@@ ing of ne@@ ural distor@@ tion and a increased loss of neur@@ ons . &quot;
it also found a del@@ ayed maturity of cer@@ eb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a decreased number of functioning ner@@ ve acc@@ us@@ ations in the brain and thus a disability of the brain growth .
&quot; it could not be noticed whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate turned into the mother &apos;s milk , and for this reason , the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS during stagn@@ ation time is con@@ train@@ dic@@ ated ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with AM@@ MONA@@ PS stood at 56 % of patients at least one unwanted event ( AE ) , and at 78 % of these undes@@ irable events , that they were not dealt with AM@@ MONA@@ PS . &quot;
&quot; frequency is defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able tox@@ ic response to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year old an@@ ore@@ tical patient care , which developed a met@@ abolic encephal@@ opathy in connection with lac@@ tat@@ azi@@ leu@@ cine , arm@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ie , peri@@ pher@@ al Neurop@@ ath@@ ie and pan@@ cre@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of transi@@ st@@ ation entered a 5 month old small child with a monthly single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms are going with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate which showed at an in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day a dos@@ izing neur@@ oto@@ x@@ icity .
&quot; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ abolic active connection , which is con@@ i@@ dered by Ac@@ et@@ y@@ elling with gl@@ ut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine which is rotating over the kid@@ neys . &quot;
Stö@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally seen is phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine with urea comparable ( both connections contain 2 embro@@ ider@@ y at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carriers for the secre@@ tion of over@@ flowing nitrogen .
5 patients with disturb@@ ances of the ure@@ tic cycle can be accepted that for every gram of the ne@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate between 0.@@ 12 and 0,@@ 15 g Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine nitrogen can be produced . &quot;
&quot; it is of importance that the diagnosis is put at an early stage and the treatment will start immediately , in order to improve the survival progn@@ osis and the clinical results . &quot;
the progn@@ osis of the early manifest@@ o form of the disease with appearance of the first symptoms in the new@@ born was almost always inf@@ ectious and the disease led even during treatment with Per@@ it@@ one@@ al@@ di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their embro@@ ider@@ y an@@ al@@ oga within the first year to death .
&quot; by Hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the utilization of alternative paths of nitrogen Ox@@ y@@ phen@@ ate , so@@ dium and so@@ dium of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born during post @-@ part@@ al ( but within the first life of life ) diagnosed . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients came the time with many to spiritual disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a sp@@ ig@@ mani@@ fold form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ boats form of or@@ ni@@ th@@ in@@ tran@@ sh@@ yl@@ ase @-@ def@@ ect ) which were treated permanently with so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and a Protest@@ ant diet , the survival rate was 98 % . &quot;
existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are also hardly rever@@ sible for treatment and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of neuro@@ logical sur@@ rection can occur .
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ox@@ idi@@ zed , which is con@@ spic@@ uous in liver and kid@@ ney enzym@@ atic with gl@@ ut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine . &quot;
the concentr@@ ations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and its met@@ abolic disorders in plasma and urine were determined by c@@ urs@@ ory healthy adults and in patients with disturb@@ ances of the ureth@@ ra and with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis according to individual supplements as well as re@@ peti@@ tive gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled studies ) .
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and its met@@ abolic ite was also investigated with cancer patients after cancer patients ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after a oral individual dose of 5 g so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in tablet form were determined 15 minutes after taking meas@@ urable Plas@@ mac@@ but@@ yr@@ ate determined by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate .
in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary cy@@ c@@ lical disorders or Hem@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin@@ opath@@ ies ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) next morning to neighbour fas@@ ci@@ sts no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in plasma .
&quot; in three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , who have been treated with so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( 20 g / day or@@ us@@ hes in three individual shel@@ ters ) during the third day five times higher than after the first G@@ aben . &quot;
retirement The medication is within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of con@@ ju@@ g@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine over the kid@@ neys .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests had been treated with tox@@ ic and not tox@@ ic doses treated with tox@@ ic and not tox@@ ic doses ( examination 24 and 48 h after or@@ al administration of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) .
&quot; AM@@ MONA@@ PS gran@@ ul@@ at is either taken oral ( inf@@ ants and children , which can still have no tablets , or patients with gor@@ ges ) or over a gast@@ ro@@ ff i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch or a Nas@@ ens@@ on@@ de . &quot;
&quot; according to the previous clinical experience the normal daily dose of so@@ dium C@@ atri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day at new@@ bor@@ ns , inf@@ ants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight of 20 kg as well as with her@@ ent and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammonia , argin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ce @-@ chain amino acids ) , Car@@ nit@@ ine and Ser@@ um@@ prot@@ an in plasma should be held within the normal range . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients who suffer from such a fixed lack of car@@ b@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ats@@ yn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or organ cases , is the sub@@ stitution of C@@ itr@@ ul@@ lin or Ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0,@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,@@ 8 g / m ² / day . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MONA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per gram N@@ atri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per 20 g so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
when R@@ atten@@ f@@ uses in front of the birth phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active met@@ abo@@ lit by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ) came to l@@ esi@@ ons in the pyramid cells of the she@@ pher@@ ds .
&quot; a prob@@ able tox@@ ic response to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year old an@@ ore@@ tical patient care , which developed a met@@ abolic encephal@@ opathy in connection with lac@@ tat@@ azi@@ leu@@ cine , arm@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ie , peri@@ pher@@ al Neurop@@ ath@@ ie and pan@@ cre@@ atitis . &quot;
Stö@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally seen is phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine with urea comparable ( both connections contain 2 embro@@ ider@@ y at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the secre@@ tion of over@@ sh@@ eba
on the basis of investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ ment of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine in patients with disturb@@ ances of the ure@@ tic cycle can be assumed that for every gram ge@@ ared n@@ atri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate between 0.@@ 12 and 0,@@ 15 g Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine nitrogen . &quot;
&quot; existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are also hardly rever@@ sible for treatment , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of neuro@@ logical sur@@ rection can occur . &quot;
after a oral individual dose of 5 g so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form were determined 15 minutes after taking meas@@ urable Plas@@ mac@@ but@@ yr@@ ate determined by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate .
&quot; during the duration of the durability , the patient can store the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of over 25 ° C . &quot;
&quot; with this procedure the small measuring sp@@ oon 0,@@ 95 g , the average measuring sp@@ oon 2,@@ 9 g and the large measuring sp@@ oon 8,@@ 6 g so@@ dium poly@@ but@@ yr@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has to receive the medication about a probe , AM@@ MONA@@ PS can be dis@@ solved in water even in water ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at amounts to 5 g in 10 ml water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases are missing specific liver enzym@@ es , so that they can reduce the embro@@ ider@@ y waste products that accum@@ ulate after the consumption of proteins in the body , not separ@@ able . &quot;
&quot; if you are being made in laboratory search , you must notify the doctor that you may take AM@@ MONA@@ PS , since so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate can affect the results of certain laboratories . &quot;

&quot; an@@ gi@@ ox becomes the treatment of adult patients with &quot; ac@@ ute Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ men &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood flow to the heart ) , for instance at inst@@ abil@@ ene Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ din@@ ary ( heart attack ) without &quot; ST@@ - Heb@@ er &quot; ( an an@@ om@@ al measuring value at electric car@@ olog@@ ram or EC@@ G ) . &quot;
&quot; will be used an@@ gi@@ ox to prevent blood @-@ inn@@ aker in patients that is admini@@ stered into a PCI , a higher dose is admini@@ stered and the inf@@ usion can continue up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can contribute in patients with Ang@@ ina or heart attack on the maintenance of blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; nearly 14 000 patients took part in the main study about the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of an@@ gi@@ ox at all@@ some gene or in conjunction with an Gly@@ teles@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another medicine for preventing blood @-@ minded ) with conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ) and a G@@ PI compared . &quot;
&quot; during the PCI was the patients frequent a St@@ ent ( a short tube , which remains in the Ar@@ tery in order to prevent a cl@@ asp ) , and they got additionally other medicines to prevent blo@@ od@@ ds , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of ACS an@@ gi@@ ox - with or without gift from G@@ PI - in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attack or re@@ vas@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation ) after 30 days or a year in total as the traditional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who were subjected to a PCI , An@@ det@@ ox in terms of all indicators was just as effective as yeast , except for heavy ble@@ eding , where it was significantly more effective than sl@@ et@@ in . &quot;
&quot; an@@ gi@@ ox must not be used in patients that may be hy@@ pers@@ ensi@@ tive ( allergic ) against Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , other hi@@ ru@@ gs or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; it may also not be used in patients who recently had a ble@@ aching , as well as with people with strong blood pressure , or severe kid@@ ney problems or a heart infection . &quot;
the committee for humanity ten@@ ants ( CH@@ MP ) had to conclude that an@@ gi@@ ox in the treatment of ACS and during a PCI an in@@ concei@@ vable replacement for pi@@ par@@ in is .
September 2004 communicated the European Commission to the company The Medi@@ c@@ ines Company UK Ltd is a permit for the transport of an@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with ac@@ ute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ men ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ Heb@@ ungs@@ inf@@ user ( IA / N@@ ST@@ EM@@ I ) in case of emergency grip or when an early intervention is planned .
the recommended initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis of an@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous bol@@ us@@ ement of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an inf@@ usion of 0.25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if the patient is carried out in other suc@@ cession , an additional bolt of 0,5 mg / kg and the inf@@ usion for the duration of the operation can be increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; according to the PCI for clinical requirements , the reduced collection of inf@@ usion can be started by 0.25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; immediately before the procedure , a bol@@ us@@ ement of 0,5 mg / kg can be admini@@ stered , followed by an inf@@ usion of 1,75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the Rhin@@ oplast@@ y . &quot;
the recommended dosage of an@@ gi@@ ox in patients with one PCI consists of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight and one of them directly related in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous inf@@ usion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of the operation .
&quot; the safety and effectiveness of a all@@ some Bol@@ us gift from an@@ gi@@ ox was not examined and is not recommended , even if a short PCI procedure is planned . &quot;
&quot; if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) can be shorten@@ ed under 225 seconds , a second sign of 0.7 mg / kg / body weight should be done . &quot;
&quot; in order to decrease the occurrence of lower ACT values , the re@@ constitutional and dil@@ uted medicines used before the application was carefully mixed and the Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis must be admini@@ stered quickly in@@ trav@@ en@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; once the ACT worth more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer required , provided the 1.75 mg / kg Inf@@ usion dose is admini@@ stered correctly . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients with moderate kid@@ ney ent@@ angl@@ ement ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) which should be subjected to a PCI ( whether with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din against ACS , or not ) , should be used a lower inf@@ usion rate of 1,@@ 4 mg / kg / h . &quot;
is the ACT value below 225 seconds to admini@@ ster a second Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis of 0.8 mg / kg and the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis again .
&quot; in case of patients with medium heavy ar@@ ters , included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( re@@ place @-@ 2 ) which led to approval was the ACT worth 5 minutes by gift of the di@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ Bol@@ us without dos@@ ing adjustments at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
3 In case of patients with severe kid@@ n@@ apping ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also for di@@ aly@@ sis patients is an@@ gi@@ ox con@@ train@@ dic@@ ations ( see below 4.3 ) .
the treatment with an@@ gi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after ending the in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous gift of un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated lever or 8 hours after completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous sl@@ um of low molecular yeast .
• well known su@@ pers@@ ensi@@ tivity against the ingre@@ dient or any other constitu@@ ent or increased blood risk . • severe un@@ controlled hyper@@ ton@@ ia and / or irre@@ ver@@ sible bacterial diseases ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and for di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are observed during the treatment carefully with regard to symptoms and signs of blo@@ od@@ ation especially when Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is admini@@ stered in combination with another anti@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; even if with PCI patients under Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din the most hem@@ or@@ ations in arter@@ ial points can occur in patients who occur in a per@@ sec@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary interventions ( PCI ) , during the treatment of principle all blo@@ od@@ ations occur . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients , the war@@ far@@ es are treated and treated with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , to ensure that the value of the IN@@ R Value ( International Standards ratio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after waste treatment has reached an existing level before the treatment . &quot;
&quot; starting from the knowledge of the active mechanism of anti @-@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ol@@ y@@ ships or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ ten@@ ag@@ gre@@ gate ) can be avoided that this active ingredients are increasing the blood pressure . &quot;
in the combination of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din with Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ ten@@ ag@@ ation or anti@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants are the clinical and biological Hä@@ mo@@ st@@ ase@@ parameter in any case regularly monitored .
&quot; the animal experim@@ entation studies are relative to the impact on the pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the binding or the post@@ nat@@ al development in@@ adequate ( see below 5.3 ) . &quot;

&quot; Ap@@ i@@ dra is used to treat adults , young people and children from six years with diabetes that require a treatment with ins@@ ulin . &quot;
Ap@@ i@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( among the skin ) into the ab@@ dom@@ inal wall to admini@@ stered the thig@@ h or the upper arm inj@@ ected or as a continuous inf@@ usion with a ins@@ ulin pump .
diabetes is an ail@@ ment in which the body does not produce enough ins@@ ulin to regul@@ ating the gl@@ ut@@ es@@ pi@@ eg@@ els ( sugar ) in the blood or the ins@@ ulin cannot be effective .
&quot; In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in is very little different from human ins@@ ulin , and the change means that it works faster and a shorter period of action has as a short @-@ effective human ins@@ ulin . &quot;
&quot; Ap@@ i@@ dra has been in combination with a slow ins@@ ulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the body can produce no ins@@ ulin in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years . &quot;
&quot; in type 2 diabetes , where the body ins@@ ulin can not be processed effectively , Ap@@ i@@ dra was examined in a study with 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
&quot; the main indi@@ ct@@ ator for the effectiveness was the modification of the substance of the substance gly@@ cos@@ ity hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood , which shows how good the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
&quot; in the first study with adults with type @-@ 1 diabetes , after six months a reduction of 0.3 % ( from 7,@@ 60 % to 7,@@ 46 % ) compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in ins@@ ulin p@@ is@@ per . &quot;
&quot; with adults with type 2 diabetes , the reduction of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0,@@ 46 % after six months with ap@@ i@@ dra compared to lab@@ y % in human normal ins@@ ulin . &quot;
&quot; Ap@@ i@@ dra may not be used in patients that may be hy@@ pers@@ ensi@@ tive ( allergic ) against ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or any of the other components , or in patients who are already suffering from a hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
the cans of Ap@@ i@@ dra must be adjusted if it can be admini@@ stered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blo@@ ody cosm@@ opol@@ itan egel .
September 2004 communicated the European Commission to the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Aven@@ tis Deutschland GmbH appro@@ ving the approval of Ap@@ i@@ dra in the entire European Union .
&quot; Ap@@ i@@ dra is as a sub@@ cut@@ aneous inj@@ ecting either in the area of the ab@@ dom@@ eter , th@@ under@@ ing or del@@ to@@ id muscle , or sub@@ cut@@ aneous through continuous inf@@ usion in the area of the ab@@ dom@@ inal cav@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; due to the reduced gl@@ omer@@ ate capacity and the ins@@ ulin delivery , the ins@@ ulin demand can be her@@ ed in patients with a restriction of the liver function . &quot;
&quot; any change of the ingre@@ dient , the brand ( Her@@ - St@@ eller ) , the In@@ sul@@ int@@ yp@@ s ( normal , N@@ PH , galvan@@ ised , etc . ) , the type of ins@@ ulin ( animal in@@ ulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can move a change in ins@@ ulin demand . &quot;
&quot; 3 An insufficient dosage or the dem@@ oli@@ tion of a treatment , especially in patients with a ins@@ ul@@ atory diabetes , may lead to a hyper@@ gl@@ y@@ a@@ emia and a di@@ abe@@ tic bo@@ eto@@ azi@@ er ; these states are potentially threat@@ ening . &quot;
the change@@ over of a patient to another ins@@ ulin type or an ins@@ ulin of another manufacturer should take place under strict doctor supervision and may make a change in dosage .
the time of occurrence of a hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the active profile of the used ins@@ ulin and can therefore change for the conversion of the therapy .
&quot; among the substances that can increase the ble@@ aching activity and increase the incl@@ ination to hy@@ po@@ gly@@ cer@@ ic , fi@@ br@@ ate , fi@@ br@@ ate , cur@@ ox@@ i@@ f@@ yll@@ in , Pro@@ po@@ xy@@ phen , S@@ aliz@@ yl@@ ate and Sul@@ ph@@ amid @-@ antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ ol@@ y@@ tika such as Bet@@ ab@@ lock@@ ern , Cl@@ oni@@ dine , Gu@@ an@@ eth@@ id@@ ine and reservoir the symptoms of rep@@ rep@@ lica will be de@@ pressed or missing . &quot;
&quot; animal experim@@ entation showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and Human@@ ins@@ ulin in relation to pregnancy , the embry@@ onic development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in into human breast milk , but generally occurs ins@@ ulin to the mother &apos;s milk , nor will it res@@ or@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; in the following are the clinical studies known from clinical trials , group@@ ed by system organs and ordered according to decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( very frequently : ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency on the basis of availability ) . &quot;

Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy is ste@@ aming the inj@@ ecting within the inj@@ ecting area to continuously change it may occur in the result of a li@@ ve@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy to the injection .
severe hy@@ po@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic bodies with awareness can be given by a in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of gl@@ uc@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) that is given by an appropri@@ ately trained person , or by in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous g@@ abe of gl@@ uc@@ ose by a doctor . &quot;
&quot; according to a gl@@ uc@@ ose object , the patient should be monitored in a hospital in order to determine the Ur@@ - a matter of serious hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes . &quot;
ins@@ ulin cuts the blood sugar levels by stim@@ ulating the peri@@ pher@@ al glu@@ co@@ se@@ up ( especially by sk@@ elet@@ al muscles and gre@@ ase ) as well as by the inhi@@ bition of gl@@ uc@@ ose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that with sub@@ cut@@ ted Ga@@ it@@ - be performed quickly and the active duration is shorter than with hu@@ g@@ man@@ em normal ins@@ ulin .
&quot; in a study with 18 male persons aged between 21 and 50 years with type @-@ 1 diabetes mel@@ li@@ - tus , ins@@ ulin p@@ ul@@ is@@ in in therapeutic p@@ umping effect of 0,@@ 0@@ 75 to 0,@@ 15 E / kg or more an under@@ dis@@ proportion@@ ate rise of the air @-@ patient effect , just like human ins@@ ulin . &quot;
&quot; In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has twice as fast operation as normal human ins@@ ulin and achiev@@ es the complete full @-@ filled effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human ins@@ ulin . &quot;
&quot; from the data , it was obvious that in an application of ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before meal a comparable post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ al gly@@ ca@@ emic control is achieved like with human normal ins@@ ulin , which is 30 minutes before meal . &quot;
&quot; In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal was ge@@ ared , a better post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ al control was given to be achieved with human normal ins@@ ulin that has been given 2 minutes before meal . &quot;
&quot; will In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal - turns , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ emic control as in human normal ins@@ ulin , which is given 2 mi@@ - nu@@ ten before meal ( see picture 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at G@@ abe 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - previously ) before the meal was given to human normal ins@@ ulin , the 30 minutes ( NOR@@ M@@ AL - 30 mins ) before the beginning of the meal was given ( figure 1@@ A ) as well as compared to human normal ins@@ ulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ M@@ AL - formerly ) before a meal ( figure 1@@ B ) . &quot;
