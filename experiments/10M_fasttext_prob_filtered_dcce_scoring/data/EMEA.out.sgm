<seg id="864">"Actrapane was in a total of 294 patients with type-1 diabetes, where the pancreas can not produce insulin, and type 2 diabetes, in which the body is unable to use the insulin effectively."</seg>

<seg id="866">Actraphane led to a acceptance of the HbA1c mirrors that pointed out that the blood sugar levels were similarly strong as with another human insulin.</seg>
