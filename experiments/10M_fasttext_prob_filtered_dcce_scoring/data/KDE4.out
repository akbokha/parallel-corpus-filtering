&quot; the package &amp; package ; includes various modules for &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; despite its low size they offer some extra functions and simplify the use of some features of &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; by making this easier available . &quot;
further information on the use of &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ;
&quot; to load these modules in the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or , select Settings button .... Open the card card tools and select the desired modules . &quot;
&quot; this is a list of standard version modules from the package c@@ de ; add @-@ ons . please note that may be more modules on your system if you have additional software installed . &quot;
&quot; you should install the package base base , the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains , before you compile this package . &quot;
&quot; to use the crash module , click in the Con@@ quer@@ or ; on Extr@@ as Ab@@ lin@@ tels . then you can view the site , the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or the list of cr@@ ashes , if available , delete . &quot;
the module starter filter ( also called folder filters ) you can reach in the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under extr@@ as starter filter . with the module you can filter &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s up @-@ to @-@ date work directory on different kind of filter .
&quot; to use the DO@@ M construction control in the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or , select Extr@@ as DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the document , for example : docum@@ ent@@ element , all other knot@@ s are sub@@ elements of this worm . &quot;
the module &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; for &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides a further view of objects with the M@@ IME @-@ type in@@ ode / directory with local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbols and text views to view the content of your local file system .
the special feature of &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; consists in ne@@ sted folder hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called tree map . each object is symmet@@ rical with a rect@@ angle @-@ map . each object is proportional to its size . this size must possess the property that the sum of the sizes of the sub@@ ordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
&quot; at &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; reflects the size of a file or folder , whereas the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries is specified . therefore , this way , even if they can be easily detected in the folder hier@@ archy . therefore , &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX command you can be considered . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; it is an entry in the Tre@@ vor representation , which represents a file or folder in your fil@@ es@@ ystem . for sim@@ pler navigation poss@@ ess@@ ing the right corner of meaningful color and labelling settings . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rect@@ angle that is switched on display colour mode , can either be depth for the slight detection of the ne@@ sted colour or figure of another file sel@@ dom , such as name , owners , group or m@@ IME type . &quot;
&quot; a rect@@ angle can be used with the various characteristics of the respective file or folder . for each property you can specify if they are available at all , only if sufficient space can occur at all , or whether the area of sub@@ ordin@@ ate check @-@ in order ) . furthermore , you can set the relative position of the cap@@ tion in the rect@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; when connecting algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps should normally be observed that the surface is proportional to the size of the entry . during the Tre@@ vor in &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; this goal is not always observed . note that less space is lost for the frame when the rect@@ angle is lost when the rect@@ angle is square . &quot;
&quot; as sharing of the surface of an entry for the sub@@ ordin@@ ated entries , the implementation remains to be left . here , it is for the let@@ ter@@ ation and for the avo@@ idance of space @-@ lu@@ des through the frame , that rec@@ kl@@ es are emerging as possible as possible . the best methods of this respect are lines , columns or recur@@ sive second division . &quot;
&quot; you can set the minimum surface for an entry over the menu entry view . instead , a smo@@ ker pattern is drawn into the area of the covered entry , in order to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an ordered entry . &quot;
originally &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets thought that was developed for application K@@ C@@ ach@@ egr@@ ind .

&quot; a simple to use camera interface is provided to you so that you can connect with your digital camera and support your photos directly into &amp; digi@@ tised . of course , every medium and every card that is supported by your operating system . &quot;
&quot; which came ; contains a fast image processing with basic training tools . you can use this to view your photos , comment , and correct . the processing features can be easily expanded with K@@ DE Image plugins interface ( manual ) modules can be easily expanded . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; that came ; easy to use , makes it du@@ sting professional skills available . it works completely in the 16 @-@ bit color room and all available modules support the raw converted by li@@ bra@@ w , DN@@ G @-@ Export and ICC Col@@ our@@ er workflow . &quot;
&quot; improved database with much more met@@ adata , such as &amp; eg ; about the camera or the lens , which can be sought . &quot;
&quot; like all &amp; k@@ de ; programmes is also &amp; digi@@ ous ; an open source project . that means , it is aimed at supporting the end users . you should therefore register problems and improvements . &quot;
&quot; &amp; that came ; try to make the det@@ our of problems or improvement issues as easy as possible for them . where you can also use the program menu , the help menu provides an entry with a under@@ lined connection . all required information is already registered in the bug system . all required information is already registered here . follow the instructions to send your report . &quot;
&quot; what came , is a project that is supported by a community . i.e. , the user and developer can help each other . if you have a regular user of &amp; digi@@ came ; however , we would like to answer any questions of other users . in this mail@@ ing list , however , you can answer any questions of other users in this mail@@ ing list . in this mail@@ ing list , however , you should be quite powerful . &quot;
you can also visit the digi@@ tis@@ ement ; homepage visit the news about shared versions and other information about &amp; that came ;
&quot; the best start to participate in &amp; digi@@ sts , is the registration in the developer @-@ mail@@ ing list . guide to report in the developer @-@ mail@@ ing list of &amp; digi@@ came ; &quot;
&quot; if you came &amp; digi@@ came ; for the first time you will be asked , where you can save your pictures and your database . you can give here a local , remote or remote folder . enter a folder name or click on the folder symbol folder to select a folder . &quot;
&quot; in the second field you must specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data is stored on your computer . &quot;
&quot; later you can add as many folders as you want to add . &amp; that came ; will you use in addition as Al@@ ben@@ library . settings &quot; &quot; setup &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you have already a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder that contains as a basic folder . &amp; that came ; considers every sub@@ folders as an album . no picture will be changed . during the search of the folder you get a progress view as this one : &quot;
&quot; &amp; that came ; thir@@ st the bibli@@ ography in all its depth . you can not include sub@@ folders , unless it came into the hidden folder . this allows you to insert n@@ hal@@ bs &amp; digi@@ sts ; done by placing a point in front of the name of the sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as a basic folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ list will not notice any photos as symbols . you can change the album by using a favorite photo . further details can be found in the section albums . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the basic folder , you can setup in &amp; digi@@ tised . after that , you should learn how to manage M@@ one albums and My keywords to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , so &amp; digi@@ came ; may also handle it . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out whether a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the menu Help pipe . &quot;
how to set up this and working with raw files is described in the sections of Ro@@ h decoder and Ro@@ h workflow .
&quot; a simple to use camera interface is provided to you so that you can connect with your digital camera and support your photos directly into &amp; digi@@ tised . of course , every medium and every card that is supported by your operating system . &quot;
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) to data transmission . the camera can also be implemented as a turn@@ table . the connection can also be implemented via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras will also use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&quot; digi@@ tization ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 for communication with digital cameras , which was an continuously increasing number of more than 800 cameras supported by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peri@@ pher@@ als without the need additional drivers . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . as photos in general are large files and transmission through the serial port is slow , this connection is now out@@ dated . &amp; digi@@ came ; supports this cameras and guides the transmission of images with g@@ photo@@ 2 through . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link . &quot;
&quot; lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 needs to be created with li@@ bex@@ if support can be read by digi@@ ket@@ ones reliably . if the advanced support is not provided by some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 camera . if the advanced support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 . if the advanced support is not possible in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 . if the advanced support is not possible by some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 . if the advanced support is not possible by some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 . if the advanced support is not possible with lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you might be imag@@ ined and the creation could be very slow . &quot;
one of the most beautiful things at the digi@@ tization ; is how easy to extend its functionality by modules :
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I @-@ Module : the K@@ DE Image plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module for &amp; digi@@ ous ; , K@@ Photo@@ album , Sho@@ ck and G@@ wen@@ view . target is to provide the modules for all video programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way manipul@@ ate , as there is also a user . your advantage is that it is much easier to add &amp; digi@@ came ; by writing a small module to add a function as the changes in &amp; digi@@ came ; even perform . &quot;
&quot; to simplify the window , you can either remove the side with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch in full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ trl + Shift + F . &quot;
&quot; the drag and drop of pictures works everywhere : you can put an image in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ tree , about the horizontal separation line or into another application window . the only limitation is that one image can not be found in keywords , file list or Search@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; - a fil@@ ming choices allows you to extract the pro@@ lifer@@ ation : JP@@ EG , PN@@ G , T@@ IF@@ F , Ro@@ h , movies and audio &quot;
the Text@@ filter is used only for the fields that are currently displayed in the toolbar . thus the filters will be displayed on the fil@@ ename only if this brow@@ sing symbols will be displayed . what fields are displayed in the dialog box .
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view on your photo@@ grap@@ e . these albums can be stored in a single album , where they are recorded on the hard disk , according to the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ properties or after the date , where the album has been created first . the date can be changed in the properties of the album . &quot;
&quot; if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . you can also add a screenshot directly to an album . select the album Im@@ porter &apos;s screenshot . &quot;
&quot; to copy or move a picture from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse on the target album and drop it there . you can move the same type also several photos and move it to the target album . &quot;
&quot; an album includes a collection of photos and the album features allow you to enter information about this collection , you need to click on the album features and select the album menu . &quot;
&quot; Alb@@ um@@ - Coll@@ ections : are a method to select your albums , so that you can choose from a common name for the sor@@ ting of your photos . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can make this in the settings for collections . &quot;
the Alb@@ ums Date : will be used if you sort your albums by date with view albums by date by date .
&quot; the buttons El@@ test@@ er , average , new test@@ er : these put the date on the oldest , the new image or the passage of the album . this is first trying to calculate the average of images from its EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last modification of each file is used in this folder . &quot;
&quot; if you first recorded an album in &amp; Pres@@ ent , the first picture in the album will be chosen as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ qu@@ il@@ quot ; this will help you to remember the photos of the album . sometimes the first photo of the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , you need to select the image with the right mouse button and in the context menu &amp; quot ; As you can select the photo on the album in the list to put it as a symbol . &quot;
an album can always be contained in a collection and Coll@@ ections may not be spar@@ ed .
&quot; &amp; that came ; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the field of folders , links below in the main window . album collections have another effect . you can of course use all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos . &quot;
&quot; the image window will provide you with the main view of your photos . if you choose an album , all pictures are displayed in this album in the image window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can customize the size of this preview with the two lou@@ pe buttons in the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; when you open an album the first time you will soon wait , while the pre@@ viewing pictures are generated . this can be avoided in which you can create new items in the menu extras . &quot;
&quot; information on each picture will be displayed below the viewing preview . which information is , you can set over settings digi@@ tization ; select the albums on this page and adjust the field Th@@ umb@@ nails your wishes . &quot;
the Th@@ umb@@ nails will have help in the mouse . if you let the mouse cursor to rest for a moment about a picture . the help shows the main features including all the keywords of a photo . the screenshot above in the section introduction into the main window shows such a help window .
&quot; photos are all what came to &amp; that , go . albums and keywords will allow you to organize your pictures as it does . you can reach any number of improvements in the menu bar ; you can reach any number of improvements in the menu bar or the menu image in the menu bar . you can choose between the observer of the pictures , a slideshow or the processing of images . &quot;
you can open the image processing with a photo by edit either F@@ 4 image ... or the context menu of the picture with the right mouse button and Edit ... select a guide on how to edit your photos . using the image processing you can view your photos and change it .
&quot; it may happen that &amp; that came ; the functionality you need , not at your disposal . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and select the program from the sub@@ menu , where your program is not displayed , you will find information in the &amp; k@@ de ; manual . &quot;
&quot; you should be aware that after processing other image processing programs to problems with the information contained in the picture includes the met@@ adata . some programs do not store this data using the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture etc. lost . &quot;
the easi@@ est way ; provides two ways to turn right mouse button . the sim@@ pl@@ est thing is right click on the Preview and select turning . in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
&quot; to change the fil@@ ename of a photo , you can click on the Preview and select F2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you will keep the extension ( .@@ jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc . ) . &quot;
&quot; if you came a photo from &amp; that came ; delet@@ es it in the du@@ st@@ bin of &amp; k@@ de ; moved . f@@ 8 picture delet@@ ing or un@@ f If you prefer really Delete , you can use this by providing Shift . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My file list ; organiz@@ es your photos using the data . &amp; digi@@ came ; used for this either the EX@@ IF @-@ Date or , if this is not available , the date of the last modification of the file . &quot;
&quot; if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be displayed in the picture gallery . you can select days or weeks in fil@@ ming below in the fil@@ ename , so that you can only show the photos of the selected days . &quot;
&quot; photos with keywords provides a flexible and powerful way to organize your photos and cat@@ alog@@ ze . Е@@ т@@ и@@ к@@ е@@ т@@ и : we are stick@@ ers to arrange the individual photos or whole groups . once a keyword is assigned to a photo , the photo can be found through the selection of this keyword or a search . &quot;
&quot; when a keyword is selected , all photos that have been marked with this keyword . &quot;
&quot; tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . here , you can also organize your keywords log@@ ically . you can also create parts of the Bau@@ ma &amp; quot ; My keywords , so you can find the keywords that you are looking for . &quot;
&quot; the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and designated keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the picture , at least for JP@@ EG , saved . you can also import your keywords in case of loss of database re @-@ imported , once &amp; digi@@ came ; the images noticed . &quot;
&quot; you can add new keywords by clicking on &amp; quot ; My keyword , click and then select new keyword , then click on an existing keyword , then click on an existing keyword , then you will click on an existing copy , this becomes the dec@@ ep@@ ist@@ le of this keyword . &quot;
&quot; you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with right mouse button and del@@ etion . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself is not deleted . only the keyword is removed from this photo . &quot;
&quot; you can change the position of a keyword by drawing it to the desired position in the tree and then place a menu , which gives you the possibility of moving the keyword . a keyword can only be in a tree at a time . &quot;
&quot; you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking and select it in the context menu item . you can edit the name of the keyword , and the icon in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword . &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , you need to select the image with the right mouse button and in the context menu . additionally , you can move the photo to the album in the list to put it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to deal &amp; digi@@ p ; s functionality with keywords , you must first use your photos with a keyword . alternatively , you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword , you can click and select it there . alternatively , you can click with the right mouse button on the preview of the pictures and select from the text menu . &quot;
&quot; you can choose a photo with any number of keywords . the photo is displayed as soon as you choose one of the keywords for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event , where it was done etc. . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided a photo with keywords , this will be shown below the preview of the picture in the main window . &quot;
&quot; you can remove a keyword , in which you can click the context menu of the photos and select from the keywords menu . the menu shows you only the keywords that have been assigned to the photo . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline View indicates a time @-@ based hi@@ sto@@ grams of the number of images per time unit . a selection framework can be postpon@@ ed over this hi@@ sto@@ gram . for a time frame , you must only specify on the bottom rect@@ angle of the drop @-@ frame , which indicates the time@@ frame . thus all related images are shown in the main window . &quot;
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . it then appears in the list below .
&quot; cover all elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , fil@@ tr@@ ams , and in the future even more . &quot;
Neb@@ ras@@ er Such@@ box is a small lamp that is green if the search hits . if you click here the filter@@ ing is deleted and all pictures are displayed again . if the search is nothing found then the lamp is red .
&quot; the advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side bar with the bin@@ oc@@ ulars . if you open this , you get a simple search box as described above . you can always fil@@ tered what you as search crit@@ er@@ ion . after you saved , it was saved in the list . &quot;

in the field below you can indicate a name for your p@@ o filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live geo@@ des .
&quot; digi@@ tization ; provides a lighthouse in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . he works with all supported image formats , also raw files . &quot;
&quot; choose one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl ; L D@@ em lumin@@ aire can be added from the context menu . the selection will be added to the lighthouse , and open its window , you can open the lumin@@ ous table quickly with L extras . &quot;
&quot; from the preview bar you can drag the pictures you want to compare , in the left or right area of the window . if you preview your copy out of the toolbar and start the zoo or jump @-@ operation at one of the images , then you can compare them in the other image . so you can compare the same section of the two images . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to select quickly from a picture series , then the two first images are automatically loaded into the areas of the toolbar . use the left mouse button in the right side to display it in the right section . this makes it simplified through a number of similar images . &quot;
&quot; of course , the normal holes are also working directly from the lighthouse as e.g. F@@ 4 file ... &quot;
all image information from the right side of the main window are available for both th@@ umb@@ nails in the lumin@@ ous table . this makes it e.g. easy visual differences with exposure data .
&quot; in the bottom of each section you will find a built @-@ in swing function , you must see in the crossed arrows . to see the visible area of the picture , you must click on the visible area and the &amp; L@@ MB ; then put them in the same image to show both images the same image area . &quot;
the zo@@ oming works as well as in other views . just use the zoom reg@@ ler below the pictures or C@@ trl ; mouse wheel to zoom in the picture and beyond . this happens in both pictures when you preview the same mode .
what is a digital component management - away from the Mo@@ de@@ point ? digital stock management looks at any part of the process following the image was taken up to the final output and permanent storage . each of the photos opens up sc@@ ans or digital photos do this but not in a systematic and efficient way .
&quot; we will give you a tool , find a plan and practical tips how to secure your images , find , protect and use photos again . we will be focusing on the procedures for digital photographers . we will be focusing on the procedures for digital photography ; we will be focusing on the process of digital photo@@ graphi@@ es , help , evaluate , dis@@ advant@@ ageous , optim@@ izing , wait and export of image files . &quot;
&quot; corporate governance is based on , inde@@ xed , categor@@ ized , categor@@ ized , secu@@ res , addi@@ tive , environmental and exported content to a mon@@ ary or cultural value hab@@ en.@@ quot ; &quot;
met@@ adata are defined as data about data . met@@ adata are in accordance with your definition data to provide information about or a documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment .
&quot; I d@@ are to claim if you don &apos;t even know more than 1000 photos on your computer . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then use the met@@ adata in a database as well as in the image files and a secure archiving that you can access with other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you do and need to know before you have to organise anything in your system , the building information structure in contrast to data structure . you have to decide whether other access to your photos may have to store if you want to save them to a reserved drive or move on a network drive &amp; etc . please note that you will eventually have to switch to a larger drive . &quot;
&quot; maybe you &apos;ll be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can quickly be found over your location . if you were in one year several times at the same place . if you have enough pictures , then you will use sub@@ folders like &amp; win ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . use . then export a folder for images that you print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have other requirements such as ver@@ sion@@ ing of photos , archiving , working processes , constant access from pictures to different themes and a large number of all . within 10 years are 95 % archives and 5 % working files and you will not be able to organize your structure for this content . &quot;
which types of files fit together ? the separation of data types makes the bat@@ ch@@ processor easier . separate new of old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup job and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a deriv@@ ative picture .
&quot; we also recommend the met@@ adata option to enable Met@@ adata in the file . this makes sure that ex@@ i@@ f@@ - and IP@@ TC data stored in the file . if you forget it , then you can then save the met@@ adata from the database into the files by selecting the corresponding point in the menu . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change ? it turns &amp; digi@@ came to them ; they have a met@@ adata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones . &quot;
&quot; now the real work begins , since you should now choose any photo , lab@@ eling and a rating . of course , you can select all the pictures that need the same attri@@ bute and then set the value then . you will start the best with the assessment or ranking . this makes sense when you can concentrate on the best photos . &quot;
&quot; let us now move with keywords , keywords , as you can continue with other programs or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
&quot; if you import cat@@ alog@@ ised images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ came ; automatically inser@@ ting the hier@@ archy inside the tree is not a problem and can simply be done by using a sub@@ building on another . the changed keywords are per@@ sec@@ uted by &amp; digi@@ tised ; updated while the sub @-@ trees per@@ sec@@ uted . &quot;
the graphic shows how different met@@ adata cover itself . this is a very rough representation since each block of met@@ adata exists in truth from many sections . fil@@ ename and calendar data are properties of all images .
&quot; enough of the keywords , the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to cat@@ alog@@ ze your met@@ adata . &quot;
&quot; do you want to just let anyone to see your photos just , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . they are certainly interested in your photos . &quot;
&quot; look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a nice beach panorama . if you consider it closer , then start to see some details see people , the place . &quot;
&quot; and now I say that this is the land of the Al@@ lies , &quot; &quot; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after the landing . Wow ! one starts to dream of dream , memories , the historical time of time is again present , you might even hear the silence . the cap@@ tion has changed your perception of this panoramic position . &quot;
&quot; for others who consider your photos , the title may possibly be more important than the picture itself to create an interest . remember that the key is to assist you about the mot@@ if you move about the mot@@ if you have moved to understand what you understand . &quot;
&quot; it is fine if an image is not perfect , if it has the strength only to work with an cap@@ tion for itself alone . &quot;
&quot; with the digi@@ tization ; you can export a number of text , in an internation@@ alist alpha@@ bet ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , then you can even save it for a selection of images at the same time . K@@ DE will even set it for a selection of images at the same time . K@@ DE you &apos;ll have to tell it for a selection of images in the cap@@ tion and / or the title of the Web @-@ Gal@@ eri@@ es@@ ystem . you will need to tell the story for the opening @-@ section , no second time . &quot;
don &apos;t remember the times in front of GPS ? as you had to find another town without the navigation system ? it was not a boring planet before G@@ oog@@ le@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures drives the spati@@ al presentation now already with light speed . &quot;
&quot; the possibilities to increase the ge@@ ol@@ ocation can already be removed in the near future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can browse through images with geographic details . you can also export the photos at the reception desk . you can also export the pictures at G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flick@@ r &amp; etc . with the G@@ oog@@ le@@ Maps @-@ Viewer . &quot;
&quot; the copy@@ left is a word game with copyright and describes the practice to use the copyrights to remove constraints on the distribution and change of copies . the same liber@@ ties also apply in all modified versions , so also for the works of others . &quot;
the following description tells you what information in the furniture page of &amp; digi@@ came ; as information you should be depos@@ ited :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for invent@@ ors and author ) : this field should add your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired , the name of a company or organisation should not be amended . this field does not support neither pur@@ ma nor sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ator . &quot;
author ( syn@@ onym for Ver@@ fibers ) : associated with the author . this field contains the work @-@ name of the photographer . examples for this can be titles as : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent photographer . since this is a note to the author &apos;s field , this must be filled out . &quot;
&quot; ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider of providers to identify who is offering . this does not necessarily be the author . if the photographer has to be listed here . if the photographer has to be listed here . if the photo is an inventory , then the group / agency will be shown here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they have no protection against abuse . each of which has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calculator can delete or change the solution for this problem . for individuals and Half professionals , this protection is very important against it . &quot;
the digital wat@@ erm@@ arks is per image unique . &amp; that came ; will be available in the near future a module for for@@ kli@@ fts .
&quot; topics : PL@@ AT@@ TEN@@ FE@@ H@@ LER , black@@ outs , ECC , transmission mistake , aging of memory media , recovery , redund@@ ancy , temperature , data size , widespread su@@ pers@@ ti@@ tions &quot;
&quot; of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that can be lost on the road or fire . these types of loss are the same that can happen to you with traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section it is about problems with the so @-@ called new media . &quot;
&quot; K@@ roll On@@ track , the biggest data recovery firm in the world , has some interesting statistics about what kind of data loss has . &quot;
&quot; to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs and you will not be treated longer than a few years . of course you can purchase CDs and DVDs in Archi@@ v@@ ous . of course , you can last longer than a few years . of course , there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for itself . whether you believe that is in your awakening . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD discs can be un@@ re@@ adable , but you can use this risk in which you can use good disco@@ graphy and good performance . they are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write a lot of reliable . it &apos;s about right to select the right . &quot;
&quot; CDs and DVDs are very sus@@ cep@@ tible to mistakes , even if you have just written it . 75 % of the data is only effective data , the rest we needed for the form@@ atting and control environments . despite this massive protection they need for the form@@ atting and control circuits , ultr@@ avi@@ olet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; for def@@ ective CDs and DVDs there is a favorable program called I@@ so@@ bu@@ ster , apparently it runs on Windows and &amp; Linux . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux . but there are also similar applications to corru@@ pted data from corru@@ pted disks , HDDs , Flash@@ media , USB drives , etc . &quot;
optical Media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to win the For@@ mat@@ war against the HD DVD . a dual layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and thus nearly six@@ sm@@ al the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8,@@ 5 GB . all that has been said to CDs and DVDs also applies to the Blu @-@ ray disc .
&quot; burn slowly with a good application fee on high @-@ quality media in a not propri@@ etary format . continue to store the media with a description , date &amp; author characteristic and there@@ after animals protected place . do not forget the data to the next generation of media , before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read these media . &quot;
&quot; Disc@@ maker reserve your statistics for themselves . your manufacturer &apos;s guaranteed include a new disk , but not the data . Google presents a large field study about the troub@@ led mechanisms of hard drives available : dis@@ errors
&quot; in short , Dis@@ ks keep in the longest when you are operated in the temper@@ ament range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C . at lower temper@@ ament , these errors will not determine the most common failure . these are especially Les@@ z@@ eh@@ ler and publishers . the expected lifetime amounts to between 4 and 5 years . &quot;
&quot; this is only the complete dict@@ ation due to over@@ load voltage . of course you can also create data loss due to a black@@ out before you have secured the files , but these losses can usually be trac@@ ed without any major problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electrical devices will not do much , that can result in devices with computer chips and high speed processors . these can cause severe damage , complete data loss , Hard@@ war@@ e@@ eing , de@@ structive mother@@ boards and other defects . protect yourself from the un@@ avoi@@ dable that leads to a loss of time and money . &quot;
the most widespread protection against black@@ noise is a super @-@ voltage protection . this is a device that is a part of the energy efficiency . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in bar . remember that not every plug @-@ bar also contains a super @-@ voltage bar .
&quot; if you are looking for a super @-@ voltage guard , then you should consider that he meets the UL 1449 standard . this guarantees a particular minimum of protection . you should also pay attention to the protection against light@@ ning bolt and thus protecting the properly connected devices . &quot;
&quot; since there is no cable that can use any cable to your computer , you should pay attention that even all the peri@@ pher@@ als can be connected to your system . some manufacturers face over@@ load back@@ packs that also includes a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connectivity options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable mo@@ dem@@ s and the television card . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ load protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks and therefore also contain the protection for the modem . so you are ideal for traveling . &quot;
&quot; while a super @-@ voltage guard your system will not really help you in a complete event . even a waste of few seconds can lead to loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a underground @-@ free power supply . &quot;
&quot; besides the protection against hyper@@ tension , these devices can use automatically cordless energy if an electric occurs . this gives you the opportunity to store your data and use the system . if you have a US@@ V then you should be sure that they have the same quality requirements as a super@@ voltage protection . in addition , the lifetime of the battery and the attached software is interesting . &quot;
&quot; concerns the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its safety in electricity disorders with the cost of avoiding this . a high @-@ quality over@@ tension can help you up to &amp; euro ; 20 cost , A 500@@ W US@@ V allows you to think of how well your computer is shel@@ tered . at the end you should always think about all the cables before you drive into the holidays . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web Service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple memory service . with the right configuration you can use this as a drive on &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as a backup tool for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data . &quot;
they are compared to the hard drives at home but very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition you have to send the data on the compar@@ atively slow Internet .
&quot; the solutions are therefore suitable only as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general f@@ use . it is too slow . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flick@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo @-@ community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are available on photos . their free memory is available to you in full resolution . the professional variant gives you more available , in case of Flick@@ r dramatically more . for 25 $ per year you get unlimited memory , which should be checked in reality . &quot;
&quot; from the view of the backup data , the Web @-@ solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and with the large companies is included in the offer a backup and a separate memory . with this they are dis@@ ast@@ er@@ ous . &quot;
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer . all comm@@ its are pr@@ one to transmission errors . the file system z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs make at least the data integr@@ arity between operating system and hard drive safely .
&quot; the hard@@ est thing is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when it is in your hardware . all these disturb@@ ances remain un@@ discovered until you should have a photo . it &apos;s quite disturb@@ ing until you have no protection in your computer . nobody seems to have thought it in your computer . no one seems to have thought of it . the Internet using its TCP protocol is a significantly safer backup path than the inside your computer . &quot;
&quot; un@@ reliable power components are another source of transmission stability , as they generate inter@@ fer@@ encing within the data stream . with normal fil@@ es@@ ystems this error will remain un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are currently not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ FS from Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates , which can handle and highly scal@@ able license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it is available soon for &amp; Linux ; and Windows available . read this article in English . &quot;
Oracle has started its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . this is still in alpha status . it uses the same protection mechanisms for the Z@@ FS and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is still not part of the kernel .
&quot; notice this not ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data processed at not@@ ebook and 46 % in the workplace systems . at not@@ ebook , the proportion of the theft is already 50 % . &quot;
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than most of viruses . it leads to a lower damage than B. theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users know only very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; has been no more sight@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less pr@@ one to data loss than propri@@ etary systems : incorrect , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to call the pro@@ lifer@@ ation fil@@ es@@ ystem . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corru@@ pt data and data loss : wrong , just the speed of the investig@@ ating process at a sudden dis@@ ruption during a surgery is higher and an un@@ defined status will be avoided . if a file is not completely saved before the problem appeared , it is lost . &quot;
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : false , theft and human mistakes are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
&quot; sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 blocks of fundamental physical boundaries . it is that while the technology is further developed , there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and smoke characteristic for all kinds of light sensors are not far away from this border . &quot;
&quot; today &apos;s cameras go towards 10 meg@@ api@@ x@@ el@@ sens@@ ors . even if this dis@@ solution is already too high for compact cameras , and the result of high quality optics . even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ xel . for higher resolutions you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or greater formats . &quot;
&quot; a 750@@ GB hard disk drive you today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not take any one another for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected by a plan and test this backup before you go wrong like the re@@ installing your operating system , the exchange of plates or the size of hard drives . &quot;
&quot; suppose you make your back@@ ups on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash , you have good luck when the drive was not connected to the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster suggests locally and destroyed a lot . forget flight gap : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough . they usually concern a whole room or the entire house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , dis@@ ast@@ er@@ tion always means a non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups the stairs up , into your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as above mentioned is a common reason for a data loss despite secure the pan@@ ic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save the one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files are to be secured . it is a snapshot of the history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differenti@@ ation : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete assurance . generates a complete snapshot of two times : one of the complete assurance and the last differenti@@ ation .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files have been changed since the last backup . you can restore the original status at any time again . this backup comes with an ver@@ sion@@ ing system at the next with the exception that it is only tri@@ mming and not ongoing .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . in contrast to Script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts r@@ sync only the difference of files that really changed . this happens and if you want to increase security over ss@@ h .
backup important images directly after you have saved them on your computer to DVD or other Op@@ tical medium .
&quot; this procedure allows you enough time to discover losses and restore it . at the same time you get a complete daily version of the working files . at the end , you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly basis for at least one month and a snapshot period should be done manually after which you have made a complete review . &quot;
&quot; topics : met@@ adata , in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP file , original , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ stores images and met@@ adata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , ... , using the internet . &quot;
&quot; so valuable images will survive the next 40 years that is about time period in which you really are interested in your childhood and youth , there are two strategies that should be noticed : &quot;
&quot; since the future is un@@ pre@@ dict@@ able due to your nature you have to look at all things today . unfortunately , there is no other possibility as a certain vig@@ il@@ ance . unfortunately , there are no other possibility to ask yourself how the current system is backward in the past . the less variations are used in the past , the more readily available to evaluate the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered with the explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards that are supported by many applications .
&quot; virtu@@ alisation is now available for any use . so if you have an old system , that for reading your images is important , then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your storage and f@@ uses technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the trade pressure for the possibility to change a system in its size . this is actually getting bigger .
let &apos;s proceed from that you have planning the scal@@ ability and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . at * ni@@ x systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and re@@ connect to a new record :
&quot; check with the command d@@ mes@@ g , if your new record has been recognized by the system , but do not depend one . &quot;
&quot; $ = / dev / sd@@ b , the new record is / dev / sd@@ b , the new record is / dev / sd@@ c &amp; EUR ; part@@ ed re@@ size / dev / sd@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; la@@ FS &amp; dollar ; resi@@ ze@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of Reiser@@ FS if necessary &quot;
&quot; open Source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day is no software there can be read , then you can create it yourself . this task is easier from year to year . &quot;
GI@@ F is a propri@@ etary format which will slowly dis@@ appears from the market . you should not use it anymore .
&quot; PN@@ G was developed as an open source standard to replace the GI@@ F . however , it can be much more . it is supported by X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC met@@ adata , 16 @-@ bit per colour channel and full transparency . PN@@ G may require a relative number of administrative information , but not as many as T@@ IF@@ F . this format we would like to recommend you to save your images . &quot;
T@@ IF@@ F was widely used as image format . T@@ IF@@ F can be stored in un@@ comp@@ ressed form or in a container with a ver@@ lu@@ st@@ free comp@@ ression algorithms ( de@@ fl@@ ate ) . a problem is however that this format is adapted by many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
DN@@ G The Digit@@ ale Neg@@ ative file format is a ro@@ yalty @-@ free and open raw format that developed by Adobe Systems . DN@@ G was designed for use by Adobe Systems . DN@@ G is now based on the T@@ IF@@ F / EP format and are committed to using met@@ adata . a hand@@ ful camera is already available now and we hope to use the competi@@ tor Canon and Nikon it also some@@ time .
&quot; this is possibly one of the reasons why in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology ; a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF . &quot;
many photographers prefer to get an original size of your recording , mostly in the raw format . X@@ MP adap@@ ts to the met@@ adata in connection between the met@@ ad@@ at@@ end@@ at@@ ei and the image file and how the image file will come . therefore , you should think if you use DN@@ G as a container and put everything there . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Met@@ adata initiative is an open organisation that supports a wide range of applications and business models supporting the activities of D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI series , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve far @-@ reaching acceptance of met@@ adata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import pictures from the camera , the card or the scanner . so long the images on the c@@ amedi@@ um are , you can use this as temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to DN@@ G and save it in your Ro@@ har@@ chi@@ v . this function is not yet implemented .
&quot; for a subtle editing , you can use external programs . if you edit the images again with the digi@@ tization ; then you should add the met@@ adata again . these were cut under the circumstances of the other programs . &quot;
&quot; protect the edited pictures for the copyright with a digital wat@@ ermark . export it only in Web@@ galleries , go to MPEG , use in contact boxes , print &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to add your photos to an album . in the section add a photo to an album , you can add a description of how you can already add to your hard drive , but the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings to import of images to your album database . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with the digi@@ tization ; connect these to the computer , turn the camera on the ad mode and place it . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when you start the camera interface , this is trying to connect to your camera . with some cameras that is made a while . some cameras do not display a while . if this is the case , the file name is displayed and a symbol for the file assignment for each file , photos , movies , music etc. on the camera . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information to each entry . with the side properties and met@@ adata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or its met@@ adata . &quot;
&quot; this dialog shows file properties and the photo@@ information to be stored internally by the camera . a symbol shows that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . note that with some digital cameras , not all information is available . &quot;
&quot; the rider Met@@ adata shows the internal met@@ adata as well as regular , manufacturer &apos;s not@@ ing , GPS etc . this information is the same as in the met@@ adata page from the main window of &amp; digi@@ tization ; or the image processing . note that these met@@ adata are not available in some digital cameras . &quot;
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to download photos on their computer is the click on the button Download and then download the selection of all . this loads the photos from their camera into a single album in &amp; that . when downloading the photos would not be deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures have been downloaded to an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
&quot; if you do not want to download all photos , you can only choose the desired option with the default methods of &amp; k@@ de ; select once you have selected the photos , you use the button to download and then download the chosen picture . the button selected will have been selected until you have selected some photos . &quot;
&quot; if your camera is supported to download is an option New Download now . these images have been downloaded until now yet . in this case , the new pictures have been downloaded with a star in the pad@@ locks . if you choose this option , of course only the new pictures are downloaded . &quot;
&quot; if you use the buttons , you can download or download the buttons , appears a dialog with which you can select the target album . the list of existing albums will be displayed , as normal folders , displayed in section M@@ one albums . select the target album out of the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after which you have chosen the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ came ; load the photos from the camera into the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all of them by delet@@ ing the button delet@@ ing all . if you only need to delete some delete , you need to select this first and delete a del@@ etion . &quot;
&quot; please note that there are no possibility of photos that you have deleted from the camera . you should carefully checked whether the photos were successful in a &amp; digi@@ de ; if you have downloaded them from the camera . if you want to delete it from the camera . if you want to delete it from the camera . if you don &apos;t want to delete it from the camera , since this is significantly faster . &quot;
&quot; cameras are used as a fil@@ ename for the photos often not particularly expres@@ sive names . this may have a double file name , if you have photos of different stick@@ ers into the same album . therefore it can be useful , the date and time on which the image was made to be integrated into the file name . &quot;
&quot; in the next section you will find options to rot@@ ate and mir@@ r@@ oring the image and for publication @-@ based under@@ lines . if you use this last option , automatically a folder will be created per day . &quot;
&quot; the options in the transmission opens three more options that will be performed before the photos are stored on the record . the first two concern the information on the author in section standard car fields . with the last option you can correct the date &amp; time for all downloaded images . &quot;
&quot; if you want a different file format than the default format , you can use e.g. in the machining field the pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % 100 % H : % M : % S . place to this option you should read the help of the command &apos;s hard time . &quot;
&quot; if you use the camera file name , you have the option to download the fil@@ ename in small letters . or in large letters if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new fil@@ ename , the &amp; digi@@ came ; for a photo used , will display the camera in the Preview below . your settings to ren@@ ame is stored and automatically used if you open the next time the camera window . &quot;
&quot; and that came ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera to run time . not all cameras provide this information . in paragraph side@@ bar Met@@ adata you can read more details , about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; the automatic rot@@ ation is usually switched , and if your camera does not provide this information , lets you switch off the photo in the original orientation . if you want to switch the automatic rotation , and choose the automatic rotation in the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; when your camera has been made available on the date , where the photo was made available , you can use this information . all pictures with the same date are loaded in the target album . not all cameras will provide this information . in the side@@ bar Met@@ a data you can read which information your camera could be embedded in the photos . &quot;
&quot; this option is normally switched off , and in this case saves &amp; digi@@ came ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this option , you need to switch this option . use the option Connect button at the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; the easi@@ est way to load photos from their computer to download is the button . select then , select the file sel@@ ector dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears in which you can select the files you want to upload . you can also select more than one file with the default &amp; c@@ de methods . &quot;
&quot; when the image is done , asks &amp; digi@@ came ; you where the images are loaded up . a folder of dialog for the camera will appear . select the desired folder and press OK to start the high load . the images will not be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . it is a position meant that in long@@ itude and l@@ ati@@ tudes is indicated , and the identification of the data can be displayed on the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European Galileo or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers , it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone is used to combine an area through automatic recording of GPS data . environmental plann@@ er , military , architecture , architecture offices and real estate mak@@ ers can use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten later , where exactly the photo taken , you can send by a single browser which shows the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; she ; users want to locate the place of the photos , it is good to share the position of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is how to get the GPS data into the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 many GPS data fields , such as the data in these fields ? there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , about a post @-@ processing of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic assignment ( manual ) and finally about the manual input of known locations . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there are currently no camera integrated into a GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS recip@@ ients to work together . either as a card module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS interface : co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q i@@ ke Ko@@ dak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
&quot; downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ p@@ sman or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel , as this is the only format that is supported by the module for geographical assignment . &quot;
&quot; there exist various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract the data from pictures and GPS to extract and cor@@ related data . on the following page you can get the same under &amp; Linux ; do : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo &quot;
&quot; if you know the long@@ itu@@ ary and l@@ ati@@ tudes or other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Harv@@ ey . it uses the pre @-@ marking coordinates such as map@@ s.@@ g@@ oogle . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ g@@ oog@@ le.com shows no European road types . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , all navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; that came to give you so much control over his work@@ flows , as possible . there are many settings that enter the behavior of &amp; digi@@ . . to choose to these settings , you need to select in the Settings menu . you can choose between this option by clicking on the symbols of the left . &quot;
&quot; select action can be set in embedded preview or reset image processing . they set the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ tised , when you click on an entry in the main view . &quot;
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the stand@@ ardis@@ ation and copyright @-@ related data . these data will be automatically selected into the appropriate IP@@ TC data fields , if the option when downloading from the camera interface , these data is written into the IP@@ TC fields . &quot;
&quot; author &apos;s title is a syn@@ onym for editor : this field should be the professional designation of the photographer . these can be design@@ ations such as attached photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description to the author &apos;s field , this also has to be filled . &quot;
&quot; Editor is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to enter the photo . this does not have to be the author if this is a book agency such as Re@@ u@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be listed here , then the group or agency should be available here . &quot;
the IP@@ TC actions store the data into the corresponding IP@@ TC field . thus the met@@ adata are permanently contained in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ came ; these met@@ adata are also available in the database and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ ites ; imported without having lost .
&quot; cap@@ tions as in embedded cap@@ tions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JP@@ EG images save : this is synchron@@ ized the comments that you can add to your photos , with the signs connected by other image , these are already written by the pictures , they will be over@@ written by the Company . &quot;
&quot; page Settings contains all the options for the information that appear , if the cursor is displayed in the main window over a file . depending on the option , this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; &amp; # 160 ; digi@@ came ; supports a number of different image formats and some video formats . to determine which file types and digi@@ tization ; display , you can add the file extensions to this list and remove them . each file in one &amp; that came ; album came , who does not have any of these enh@@ ancements ; ignored . &quot;
&quot; the default settings can be reset again , by pressing the button actu@@ alize the right of each category . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the lighthouse of &amp; Pres@@ came ; can be set on this page on default . every pictures have switched on to the default . some photos do not have different sizes and the syn@@ chron@@ ous mode , then you should only use different sizes and the syn@@ chron@@ ous mode . if you have one , then you can get better response results . &quot;
&quot; by default , the image processing a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select this here . you can use the toolbar without requ@@ iring the image processing in full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; flo@@ ating and se@@ ated areas of an image can be marked with dar@@ ker or bright colour in the picture . these colors will be set here . in the picture editing , this connection mode can be entered with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 and off . &quot;
Chro@@ ma sub@@ ver@@ bal is meant that the images are coded in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance than in colour information . please read this article in Wikipedia about the further explanation .
&quot; with the setting PN@@ G comp@@ ression allows you to reduce the size of PN@@ G files . this surgery is reduced to the image quality , since PN@@ G requires a quick algorith@@ m . the only effect is that the image data is more time for outlet and un@@ pack . if you have a fast computer , you can put this value on a high comp@@ ression . this means 1 : a low and 9 a high comp@@ ression . &quot;
with the T@@ IF@@ F files comp@@ ress you can switch the de@@ fl@@ ate images for T@@ IF@@ F pictures . this reduces the size of T@@ IF@@ F pictures . this reduces the size of T@@ IF@@ F pictures . it does not affect the image quality since the de@@ fl@@ ate algorith@@ m is working .
&quot; with the adjustment of loss @-@ free JP@@ EG @-@ 2000 files you can select it freely . even if you have written the embarrass@@ ed setting , the relationship between quality loss and file size was written far better than in normal JP@@ EG . when this paragraph was not supported , met@@ adata were not yet supported , but was in the planning . &quot;
&quot; in previous versions of &amp; Pres@@ enting , the image processing only saw an image of images . currently , it is very fast becoming a tool for mani@@ p@@ ulation of your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the default is that all green pixels is equal . if the linear green pixels of the CCD @-@ Sens@@ ors are responding to the pixels in just lines , this difference does not solve this problem with a minimum loss of details . this option makes the picture a little soft , eliminated , but the 2x@@ 2 g@@ itter@@ mu@@ ster with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the whit@@ eboard used to use the camera . otherwise , if put the automatic color balance . &quot;
this setting is only used if the white figure is not set the same . standard is it a solid colour balance which has been photograph@@ ed on a white map which is photograph@@ ed in sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SLR cameras . the use of the second sensors has the effect that supp@@ ressed images in four steps more details in the nickname . for other cameras this option will be ignored .
&quot; the standard is it the sh@@ red@@ ness , so the parts of your images are burned down , due to the in@@ ability of your camera to see the r@@ hin@@ ders . when setting colors solve some unusual results , since they show the sh@@ red@@ ness in various Ros@@ at@@ ö@@ nen . finally , you can attempt to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the sp@@ oil . &quot;
&quot; this is possible because blue pixel in general are not as fast as green and red . &amp; that came ; and d@@ cra@@ w try to re@@ construct the missing green and red parts from the still not saturated blue pixel . of course , this is a question how much color or white you want . &quot;
&quot; if you select the option re@@ construct option , you get the option to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adapted for each image individually . &quot;
put the L@@ umin@@ ation@@ ist according to your taste . you probably have to put it on a bit higher than the standard 1 . this can also be done later in the image Options of &amp; digi@@ tization ; it can be done later in order to keep the time for dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small so you should proceed conserv@@ ative .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing -@@ algorith@@ m is a digi@@ tised image to count a complete image of the sub@@ lime images that provides many cameras and which presents a matrix coloured pixel . this algorith@@ m is also known as C@@ FA @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation or Far@@ bre@@ d .
&quot; what came , and D@@ cra@@ w put you three alternatives available : Bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was the first algorith@@ m of the edges ( for adap@@ tive homo@@ gene@@ ity ( for adap@@ tive homo@@ gene@@ ity ( for adap@@ tive homo@@ gene@@ ity ) was interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result . &quot;
&quot; if you know the far@@ ther deviation of your lenses , you can put the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a color @-@ proof correction , since you will be carried out during the pipe . &quot;
a profile translated the colour information and gives instructions how these should be given back . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; that came ; information like the colour information from a bull to translate into the other so that colors are as accurate as possible .
&quot; behavior Ques@@ tions , if an image is open in the image processing / colour administration module with raw files . &quot;
&quot; color @-@ folder folders click here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you can save all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ came ; then examine this folder during the start . &quot;
settings of ICC Pro@@ files you have here the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to be depos@@ ited . everything can be changed when opening the raw file .
the color administration view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ z . here are just your images colored does not manage the entire screen .
&quot; the input profiles should be used to the camera creation and model that you use . not all profiles are included in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which does not have any color tone or Gam@@ mak@@ or@@ re@@ rection . this means that you have to carry out the color scheme itself . &quot;
&quot; there are other options like the soft @-@ proof profile , which you can em@@ ulate how your image can be returned from one device . this is very useful before you can print a smaller colour area than your camera and some colors are therefore very satisfied , rather than to leave on the blind algorith@@ m of your printer . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras it is quite apparent which is intended for what is intended . unfortunately , not with the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is of course in@@ officially : &quot;
&quot; the Canon profile extensions can be recognized the style for the goal : F for an accurate style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for port@@ tra@@ it@@ ers and S for the standard style . &quot;
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image Plugin Interface . it is an interface , supported by a series of &amp; k@@ de ; image searches and image processing ; many modules support that have been written using every program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface . &quot;
&quot; if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . choose which you want to use and these are then loaded from &amp; that . these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the preview . &quot;
&quot; short commands for tasks , which are carried out by modules can be set in the menu under settings of short set . &quot;
further information ( in English ) via K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project at http : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the hand@@ books of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
&quot; the settings of the slideshow should be easy to understand . the top reg@@ ler ends the time between the imaging , usually are 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . the other connections turn off the met@@ adata one or off , which are built at the bottom of the pictures during the viewing . &quot;
&quot; camera features show on the left hand a list of all currently supported cameras . on the right side there is a button automatic detection , which is trying to use a camera that is connected to the computer . currently , if you want to use this , make sure that the camera is properly connected , the US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage . &quot;
&quot; at the lower end you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) . this field is only active if you choose a US@@ B@@ - or Fire@@ Wire mass camera from the camera &apos;s camera . you have to indicate here the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / , specify , where you attach your camera . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with the digi@@ tization ; you need to connect the camera to your computer , put them into the display mode and turn off . &quot;
&quot; try out whether &amp; digi@@ came ; the camera automatically recognis@@ es . if not , you can set camera model and port manually . after you have set your camera , your camera will appear in the menu camera . &quot;
you can choose any name for your camera . this is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you have more than one camera you can insert all here .
with the option Con@@ figur@@ ator dialog for the moving of &gt; images in the tr@@ ash bin you can set the inter@@ g@@ hness of &amp; digi@@ ous ; when del@@ etion of a photo in an album . in the sections of a photo and del@@ etion of a album you will find more details .
the editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can imp@@ lied through &amp; digi@@ tization ; if you use the option to make changes in the right side bar without any queries . otherwise you will need to apply the changes with the button to make changes .
you can also include the advertisement of the welcome screen by &amp; Pres@@ ence ; when sub@@ types interru@@ pt . this speeds up in circumstances the start @-@ process of &amp; digi@@ came ; .
&quot; the setting of Bei@@ m start to search for new photos &amp; digi@@ came ; this is extended to look for new or deleted albums / photos . this is extended the start time of &amp; that came ; when something out of the base was deleted , asks &amp; digi@@ came ; you whether it should delete it from the database . &quot;
various color schem@@ as can be used in &amp; digi@@ tis@@ one ; used to adjust the main window to your tastes . these settings can be selected using settings design from the toolbar . one preview of the available designs is displayed below :
&quot; these designs have been defined in simple files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; that , please find more information about this tutorial . &quot;
&quot; &amp; that came ; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use this to view your photos and go to correction and improvement . the image processing can be started by clicking on an image or by the context menu of preview and selection of entry . &quot;
&quot; the image processing includes a series of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ tised , so you may not be part of your distribution . further information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules can be set in the image editing . &quot;
&quot; a status line at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ ename , current file @-@ number , en@@ roll@@ able factor , and the current image . &quot;
a menu bar on the top and below the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently used functions .
the processing functions of the image processing change your photos . no the functions will however change the original photo before you save file or save the button saving from the toolbar . note that you can no longer recover the original photo once you have saved the image .
so you should make a copy of your image before you change it . this allows you to save it with file save .
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image again by using the menu file re@@ produce the button re@@ produce re@@ produce in the toolbar . they then lose any change that you have done on the photo since the last save . &quot;
nearly every action of the image processing may be re@@ inst@@ ant@@ aneously or restored . the last action allows you to be re @-@ running and re@@ inst@@ ated by filling editing or recovered reco@@ vers from the menu .
&quot; if you often use this , you should make yourself the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ trl ; -@@ Z to re@@ inst@@ ant@@ aneously and C@@ trl ; -@@ Re@@ ading @-@ Z to restore . &quot;
&quot; if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; over the return or re@@ produce button in the toolbar you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu @-@ menu , all actions in between also turns or restored . &quot;
&quot; once you have started the image processing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword , by using the navigation heads in the toolbar . if you have made changes in the menu file you will be asked if you want to store them . &quot;
you can start in the photo and out zoom in which you can use C@@ trl ; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the saf@@ est menu .
&quot; to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the toolbar and automatically select this button . &quot;
view full screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . you will come into the normal view in which you did not use the toolbar button . normally you can view this in the dialog dialog by &amp; digi@@ tised . you can view this in the dialog box ; see this you can see the section to the setting of the image processing .
&quot; if you want to print the current image , you can select in the menu file and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu you can print individual pictures or all propositions . you can select only the pictures with the default methods and select from the menu album Ex@@ por@@ e prints . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the program came ; main window has a side bar at the right edge , providing important information and actions for the selected images . the same page bar is available without the navigation bar , even in the image processing . it will be shown if one of the five riders can be cli@@ cked : &quot;
&quot; More@@ info Click on the same rider , the side bar will appear or again disappear into the mar@@ gin . &quot;
&quot; in the compl@@ ain@@ ant you can insert cap@@ tions with un@@ limited size or insert . note that the comment below is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . that means all special characters are allowed . the labelling is copied into the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - fields , so that you can be used by other programs . &quot;
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII character and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments will be cut to 2000 characters and special characters are formed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC lab@@ our@@ field in other applications you should consider these restrictions .
&quot; after you have commented it , you use either the kno@@ b button or simply switch to the next picture , the cap@@ tions will then be saved . &quot;
&quot; besides the turn button , there is a button More . with this you can write further met@@ adata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also select the met@@ adata in the files . this will always be done if you have selected a met@@ adata setting . &quot;
the section Review indicates a review scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in Search@@ ing and Sor@@ ting . it can be used either with a single mouse @-@ click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut d . the rating from the side@@ bar will always be applied to a picture . to view multiple images at the same time and use the context menu .
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field ur@@ gency . the coding follows the sch@@ ema in the following table :
&quot; the sampling view indicates a search box for filter@@ ing the keywords , the sampling tree , and a selection box with the previously in this &amp; Pres@@ ent ; -@@ session used . &quot;
the keyword se@@ ater will be dynam@@ ically adapted to the notification . you can quickly limit the number of possibilities in search of a keyword . this ability is particularly useful if you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom is another relief in entering keywords at a picture series . if you have included various keywords , they will be stored for quick access . &quot;
&quot; the keywords can also be set by mark@@ ers of the corresponding An@@ kreu@@ z@@ felder in the tree . all keywords of an image will be stored in the IP@@ TC field keyword . &quot;
&quot; if several pictures are selected in the main view , and you select a keyword in the keyword box , this will only be applied to the highlighted picture and not on the full range , if you want a selection with a keyword , please read the section of the keyword . &quot;
&quot; the side@@ bar sampling filter is used to change the selection of the images shown in the main window . normally , the left side bar with their album , - Dat@@ um@@ - , sampling and addi@@ c@@ tional filters are used . if in addition , one or more sampling can be used on the right , the intersection of these two are displayed . all issued keywords are available . &quot;
&quot; you can also drag and merge . suppose you have chosen in the main view . if the keyword already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side bar and click the selection . below , a dialog you ask if you want to ask the keyword . &quot;
&quot; in the top example shows the main window shows the images on a calendar day . the keyword filter is on no worries , what the quantity is reduced to three pictures . they were drawn with Str@@ g + a , and after that , a keyword was drawn from the right of reference and filed there . a dialog asks if this keyword is set . &quot;
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be switched on settings .
&quot; if you have a rule with and created and determine that it may be one or his , you can easily change this with a double @-@ click on the text and in the setting . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the entry , after which in the database is sought . this can be an album , name , keyword , picture , keywords , etc . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or a string , which is already set in the database . &quot;
you can e.g. add a wide search across all elements of the database with the following options :
&quot; if you want to group options , you only need the anchor box at the end of the rule and then to use the button group@@ ing . the options look like this : &quot;

this article / tutorial was written primarily by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I focused mainly on &amp; digi@@ came ; s concrete implementation adapted .
&quot; the reason why you can use a coloured workflow , the colors come from your camera or scanner to get a pre@@ dict@@ able devi@@ ations from the actually photograph@@ ed or sc@@ anned colors . with a colour@@ ful workflow , you can print the colors on your monitor and match the colors that are available from your camera or scanner or to publish them from your digital dark@@ room . &quot;
&quot; if the theme is on color management , then everyone wants to know which buttons , does not need to provide you with information about colour management . unfortunately , the sense of this tutorial is to provide you with additional information about colour management . in addition , links with deeper information allow you to make your own inform@@ ational decisions to make you get the desired result . &quot;
&quot; if your image is met six below , then you don &apos;t have to worry about color management . &quot;
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated on the s@@ R@@ GB mode . ( more information can be found below )
your only other image orders are per e @-@ mail or the web where s@@ R@@ GB of de @-@ fac@@ to standard is .
&quot; so if J@@ R@@ GB is so well working and life for all so easy , why should one use a different colour foam and thus have to make thoughts on colour @-@ management ng up ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of limitation of s@@ R@@ GB compared to the colors that we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hu@@ fe@@ isen@@ ent region , and colors in s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ R@@ GB with some larger colour dreams so visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms excell@@ ente page and then click on Info and then on information About R@@ GB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to kick my monitor k@@ alli@@ on when I decided to work for this only in s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum ?
&quot; yes ! if you work in the s@@ R@@ GB mode or not , you have to work your monitor k@@ alli@@ bri@@ ers , since s@@ R@@ GB does not cover the circle . if you work as in the Far@@ br@@ aum of s@@ R@@ GB , then you must either use your monitor on the s@@ R@@ GB standard , a matching monitor profile or both . &quot;

&quot; this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions , which can improve the picture in most cases . use it before you try a further manual processing . &quot;
&quot; the functions are norm@@ alize , the same , automatic ab@@ is@@ lat@@ ency and contr@@ asts expand automatically from your colors to make the best . you will have to experiment with these effects , to see which best in your photo . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this method scal@@ izes the lumin@@ aires , so that the dark@@ est point is black and the bright@@ est point as bright as possible without his color sh@@ ady . this function is often a Mag@@ ical correction for pictures that are dark or mixed . &quot;
&quot; the same : this method j@@ us@@ ement the lumin@@ ance factor of the colors of the selected picture , so that the hi@@ sto@@ grams of the intensity is as flat as possible . at times , it has the same very good results in improving the contr@@ asting of an image , sometimes it also produces a very powerful surgery , which causes either wonder in a picture or it destro@@ ys it . &quot;
&quot; the same : this method maxim@@ izes the colour area in the red , green and blue channel . you will find the dark and light border @-@ tones and j@@ us@@ hes the red , green and blue @-@ channels to complete hi@@ sto@@ grams . &quot;
contrast : this method improves the contrast and lumin@@ osity of the R@@ GB values of an image by the move of the lowest and highest values in between . this is only visible in wash@@ able pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the White @-@ plated by &amp; Pres@@ came ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the whit@@ eboard line of a photo .
&quot; the White @-@ equal correction is a bit limited to over a far@@ ma room with 8 @-@ bit each colour can occur . if you can perform the whit@@ eboard in the raw mode , which work in the 16 @-@ bit mode , so your ways to correc@@ ting the correction is better . &quot;
&quot; this tool is based on a white @-@ equality law , the copyright of Pa@@ wel T. Jo@@ ch@@ ym is protected . they will start it via the menu entry into the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ set can be adapted to the size . on the left hand , both the original image and the preview of the target picture . the preview will see dynam@@ ically the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original white box , then click on the sub@@ window . &quot;
the preview of the target photos has a red mark@@ er . the g@@ umin@@ ance of the pixels under this mark@@ er is displayed as vertical line in the Hi@@ sto@@ grams .
&quot; to the right above , a hi@@ sto@@ grams appears that dynam@@ ically is changed once you have a parameter . this hi@@ sto@@ grams is very helpful , even in well lighted images , most of the pixels very small L@@ umin@@ ators . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ anz . &quot;
the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and gam@@ ma . the shadow adju@@ sting can improve your photos or also down the sc@@ m@@ bling of your photos . &quot;
&quot; to use the controls around the above controls , you should use the color @-@ temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press on these button and then click anywhere on the picture to use selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . in this way the temperature and green light are set automatically . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the whit@@ eboard with the list of pres@@ ets . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ heating indic@@ ative indi@@ ct@@ ator increases the colors when more than a color channel of the Pix@@ els are over@@ exposed .. they will display the combined result in the white box . this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
&quot; the buttons Save as and loading exactly this . any adjustment of the white @-@ like you have set , you can save it into a text file and later load it again . &quot;
the button pres@@ ets set up all filter@@ ing values back on their default values and the corresponding neutral white mamm@@ als . note that some neutral settings are a different photo than your original . if you save this one &apos;s original image .
&quot; you can set the coding of the edited here . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JP@@ EG format , 16 @-@ bit co@@ coding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . this en@@ coding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . this coding needs also more record space , computing time and stands for the formats PN@@ G , PN@@ M , T@@ IF@@ F and DN@@ G . &quot;
this tool opens the same dialogue as to process raw materials . it uses the change and the assignment of color fil@@ ming . colour mapping can be performed by the sub@@ window for use of color fil@@ ming . a det@@ a@@ illed manual for the use of paint @-@ profiles can be applied to the chapters of color management .
another important tool is available in the menu under colors Ton@@ valuable correc@@ tions . this tool provides an integrated way to view multiple shades of windows at the same time . this is helpful when your camera or scanner can always be the same bug and you can always find the same correction . in the manual for the sound correct correction you will find more information .
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gr@@ asp@@ ation that you can find under colors gr@@ ad@@ ation in the menu .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ sts ; tool color effects provides you with four colors , a solar installation , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a cant@@ on filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing was Solar@@ isation , also Sab@@ ati@@ er , an effect of being created when one was developed in part developed by a short light@@ ning light , and after the development of the image . this result was a partial neg@@ atively affected by the second lighting . this tool allows you to achieve this interesting effect . &quot;
&quot; the intensity controls the solar thermal . at about 50 % intensity , the image shows what chem@@ ically possible is . a further increase creates a negative picture that is not to generate on phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . &quot;
this is an example of the solar system . the original one is the ( 1 ) and the finished ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
&quot; the Vi@@ vid @-@ Filter sim@@ ulates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it diff@@ ers from a satur@@ ation effect , that it makes a greater contr@@ asting effect . try it easy , it em@@ bell@@ ishes many photos . &quot;
&quot; Vel@@ via is the brand name for one on day@@ light @-@ based paint movie which is manufactured by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors with day@@ light and high contrast . the name is a composition of &quot; &quot; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and therefore a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly saturated inks , however , are also some photo@@ grap@@ hen . Vel@@ vi@@ as are many saturated inks , especially to which the barely landscapes are plain , too much . &quot;
the ne@@ on@@ filter si@@ ly sim@@ ulates Ne@@ on@@ light to the contr@@ asts of the result . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ ders re@@ peti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on@@ light . at large pictures the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contr@@ asting and the lumin@@ osity of the photo . you can view on the different color shades of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . once you are satisfied with the result you are using the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
&quot; if you get a photo in bad light conditions , you can get the reverse problem : one to large satur@@ ation . also in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation can reduce it . all changes you can perform in the preview . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k . &quot;
&quot; between the complex tool gr@@ ading and the simple lamp / gam@@ ma is the tool sound @-@ correct correction to improve the exposure . even if the dialogue with this tool works very complicated , you need only the range of sli@@ ders . concrete the three sli@@ ders below the hi@@ sto@@ grams . &quot;
&quot; the window contains an graphic of the intensity setting , a hi@@ sto@@ gram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graphs , three sli@@ ders will be cli@@ cked into the inside and which can be postpon@@ ed to change the intensity levels of the picture . the left side represents the dark and the right side of the bright areas . &quot;
the easi@@ est way to learn how to learn it is to shift the regul@@ ator and to consider how the image changes .
&quot; on the right , the original and the preview of the picture can be viewed dynam@@ ically . the preview is dynam@@ ically displayed using the settings of the picture . on the left hand , the following options are available . &quot;
sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be adjusted if the Hi@@ sto@@ grams is displayed using a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ om@@ y axis . in pictures the large areas of a constant colour involve the linear Hi@@ sto@@ grams of a single pillar . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ ic influences is useful .
&quot; three Reg@@ ulators : the top for the dark ones , the middle for the bright t@@ ints and the lowest for the middle tones , frequently called Gam@@ ma@@ values . &quot;
&quot; the three color pin@@ pet@@ tes can be used in the preview of the original image in order to adjust the input of the shade , middle and bright shades . in addition , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment . &quot;
&quot; insert : the options apply to the selection of manual values for each field . it also exist two controllers that can be used for example , for example to create an un@@ even image as background to create something else in the fore@@ ground . &quot;
automatic : this button will automatically set the image automatically according to the intensity values of the picture .
&quot; save as and loading : with these buttons , the values indicated in the file system can be saved and later again . to this , the Gim@@ p level format is used . &quot;
&quot; when you use this mode and the three d@@ pi@@ pet@@ tes , the entr@@ ances will automatically use for all shade , medium and Sundays and click on the preview of the original image for red@@ head , green , blue and the L@@ umin@@ es@@ can@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the option of indic@@ ative indi@@ ct@@ ator controls all the colour channels to display over @-@ coated pixels and you can view the combined result of all channels . here it is an indicator , that means you will get the effect only in the preview , and it is no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see an example of the adjustment of the input application applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and Alpha channel , as well as the excer@@ pts are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left , half of the original and the target image is displayed . the Preview will dynam@@ ically updated depending on your settings . on the right hand , the following options are available : &quot;
modification channel : this Cho@@ box allows it to specify the channel that is modified by the module :
&quot; besides this box , two symbols were taken to switch between a linear and logical view . for images that have been recorded with a digital camera . for pictures with large areas of a constant color , the linear mode creates a wide beams . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ ic mode is helping . &quot;
&quot; if you move e.g. a cour@@ vent@@ h to the right , e.g. the bright shades , then you can see that these bright t@@ ints are corresponding with dar@@ ker ou@@ sels and that the related sculpt@@ ing pixels are dar@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; on the preview of the original photo is a red mark@@ er to see . if you want to change these markings on the area you want to move , a suitable line on the curve is shown the original value . create a point on this line and move it down to the value according to your taste . &quot;
save as and loading : with these buttons you can make exactly this . each curve you can have already stored within the file system and be loaded later . the file format is the Gim@@ p curve format .
&quot; if you want this method and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes buttons automatically create the check@@ points of the curve for all channels of the shadow , middle and Sundays . enable the d@@ pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the original one to put the check@@ points for the red , green , blue and L@@ umin@@ es@@ cur@@ ve . &quot;
&quot; the option of indic@@ ative indi@@ ct@@ ator controls all color channels to display over@@ se@@ ated pixels . if in more than one channel covered , you get the combined result . this is what you get the effect only in the preview , and it is not an effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a black @-@ white picture that was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ es@@ channel . Sch@@ atten@@ - and Sonn@@ ent@@ ley was used with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the cur@@ ves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel bl@@ ender of the &amp; Pres@@ enter ; image processing is a tool to improve the shades of colors or change the shades of the photos .
the channel bl@@ ender is another highly developed tool to mix the shades of images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel bl@@ ender of image editing .
&quot; with the channel optional , you can select the color for the Hi@@ sto@@ grams : this gives you a first note as you can correct the channels by selecting the relative distribution and precip@@ itation . the left area of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed as compared to your own rider . &quot;
the preview of the target picture has a red mark@@ er . if you position this in the picture a vertical line in the hi@@ sto@@ grams appears to indicate the corresponding colour value .
the controls for the module are right below : regul@@ ator for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you want to enable the appropriate color components . this is particularly practical if you are also the option Mon@@ och@@ rome as the channel bl@@ ender then DAS tool for generating great black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green canal for black and white por@@ traits . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you interact with Mon@@ och@@ rom , the reduction of a colour comes to a visible rust@@ ling , which does not appear in the same place in the color channel , and their wid@@ gets in each channel . if that is the case you can improve your mon@@ och@@ rome . thus , in which you can reduce the far@@ rier first . &quot;
the save as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any bl@@ ender setting allows you to save it for later and then load the file format is the Gim@@ p channel .
&quot; the option of indic@@ ative indi@@ ct@@ ator controls all the colour channels to display over @-@ coated pixels and you can view the combined result of all channels . here it is an indicator , that means you will get the effect only in the preview , and it is no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a photo shown in the blue channel . the option L@@ umin@@ anz is enabled . the original original image is under ( 1 ) and the working image under ( 2 ) .
black / White photography was always intri@@ gu@@ ing because of your abstr@@ action . with the development of digital photography is black / white a job step because color pictures simply can be converted to the computer . also with a set of film rolls profiles .
&quot; Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3200 , Il@@ ford H@@ P@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P2 Super &quot;
&quot; filter filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film @-@ coating with a green lens filter . this looks good , in all scen@@ eries and fits very good to por@@ traits against the sky . thus similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Green filter . &quot;
Oran@@ ge@@ il@@ ter : si@@ sim@@ ulates a black / white film @-@ coating with a or@@ angen l@@ sen@@ filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air @-@ photos . thus similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Oran@@ ge@@ il@@ ter . &quot;
rot@@ ect : sim@@ ulates a black / white film @-@ coating with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic directions for day@@ time . so similar to the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Rot@@ filter .
yellow filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film @-@ coating with a yellow @-@ filter . this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yel@@ lowing .
&quot; Se@@ pi@@ aton : generates warm bright and middle @-@ notes while having added a bit cold in the p@@ att@@ ent@@ ö@@ nen , this is very similar to the process of the p@@ ale of a dru@@ cks and the re @-@ development in a se@@ pi@@ at@@ oner . this is typical of the photos of your grand@@ mother and thus similar to the 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Se@@ pi@@ af@@ il@@ ter . &quot;
with the &amp; digi@@ came ; tool texture apply you can apply decorative tex@@ tures on an image .
&quot; adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can look it like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or as a wall image on a wall . the menu entry image can be used for it . &quot;
Rel@@ ief : move this parameter to the right increases the sunshine of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of texture on the picture .
a paper textile effect has been used on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) to see . the parameter relief is set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ came ; tool frame can add a decorative frame to add a picture .
keeping the eye of a spect@@ ator in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . a possibility to keep its attention is to get the image to a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the stre@@ ak eye . under the picture frame the module can be started out of the image processing .
&quot; type : with this parameter you put the desired past@@ ment@@ type for your image . all rounds the picture with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce rounds it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ white paintings ) , cou@@ plings with a cute three @-@ dimensional frame of the ideal for a but@@ ton@@ ing f@@ ect and decorative area adds an ornam@@ ental framework with patterns . &quot;
width : returns the width of the frame in percent . the value range for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; this is bigger than the original , but the original aspect ratio is greater than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for the pressure of images , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; with this practical tool , you can easily insert a form@@ att@@ ed text into an image in any place . this also goes on several places when you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply type the text and place it with the mouse . use tex@@ tual device , orientation , color out of the color room and the character set with its properties like you need . you will just choose a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ sided background . &quot;
&quot; any setting you have chosen for your text can be changed , until you click on the button &quot; OK &quot; . after the image has been stored , the text is part of the picture . it can no longer be changed . &quot;
with the &amp; that came ; tool sten@@ cil allows you to apply a sten@@ cil via a picture .
the menu image pattern can be used in image processing can be used to create sten@@ cils over one picture .
&quot; for the sten@@ cil there are no restrictions on the size and orientation . however , you need to add the PN@@ G file format and should add with maximum comp@@ ression ( 9 ) to add the template of the template ; if you just send an e @-@ mail in English to the &amp; digi@@ came ; mail@@ ing list digi@@ tization @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .. &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool for the first time , you need to put your shot in dialog with the button of the button in dialog box . choose the folder you will be copied for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after the root folder for the sten@@ cils has been set a tree view , which reflects the folder structure of the Sch@@ ab@@ lon@@ en@@ folder . selecting a folder update the preview of the sten@@ cils automatically . &quot;
below the preview are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlarged the shown image . it is centered to the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; reduction : this button comp@@ ressed in the image below . it is centered to the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you must enlarge the picture accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move this button to move the image below the template . take the picture and place it at the desired position .
use OK when you want to use the template to your image . the image will then be automatic of the sample size .
&quot; &amp; Pres@@ ence came ; provides three different tools for she@@ eting , each of you has mer@@ its in other areas . &quot;
&quot; sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for the sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and simple , but produces particularly in dark areas , gra@@ ined images . &quot;
Un@@ sharpen@@ ed mask works on the contrast the edges of the edges to look like a picture . actually it does not use it rather psych@@ ov@@ is@@ u@@ ell . you can use it rather a good job . the algorith@@ m was taken from Gim@@ p and he is copyrighted by W@@ inst@@ on Chang .
&quot; re@@ searches is possibly the best of the three , since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has various parameters to adjust . &quot;
&quot; photos without focus as well as most digi@@ tised images need a correction of the sharp@@ ness . these are smaller than the dis@@ solution . this same phenomenon can be observed in a common colour , so that the same phenomenon can be observed if color points are printed on paper . the SLR cameras require more de@@ gra@@ zing as normal cameras for the private user . &quot;
&quot; with JP@@ EG @-@ images often a camera has been used internally . images in raw material , on the other hand must always be pushed into during the processing . &quot;
&quot; some scanner apply a sharp@@ ness filter already during the reading of the picture . if you dis@@ able to de@@ activate this , you get control of your image . &quot;
in some situations you can get usable outcomes by using a photo with the sharp@@ ness . this allows you to call the menu entry .
&quot; but you should deal with caution , as the results do not work very natural : the sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also intensi@@ fy the smoke . in general , you can reach more information about the menu entry . under re@@ foc@@ uss@@ ing you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for the sharp@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have the opposite problem : one picture is too cr@@ un@@ y . the solution , the image is a little soft to draw , is much easier than it comes to shar@@ pen . use the tool on the right side of the dialog box shows you the effect on your photo . &quot;
the filter bl@@ ur@@ am is a very good tool to remove sli@@ der from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and the preview will help you edit the image . the preview of the filter shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values are often good results and should be tried out first . an increase in radius or the amount ampli@@ fy the effect . if you produce the Un@@ sharp@@ ness mask , become smo@@ othing and the impression of gr@@ ats in the proximity of sharp edges . &quot;
the radius presents one like many pixels on each side of a cann@@ ed by the filter . high resolution images allow greater radi@@ i . you should therefore find pictures at the best in their final dis@@ solution .
the amount represents the percentage of the original and the wi@@ ped image one of the original is added to the original . thus the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
&quot; the tail value is a fraction of the maximum R@@ GB value and the applied difference level . you can thereby define a minimum difference in this way for a soft difference between the tones of sharpen@@ ing and therefore beauti@@ full error in faces , Heav@@ ens and water bodies . &quot;
&quot; this is an example designed for the in@@ bl@@ ur@@ sharp filter . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the working image has been applied ( 2 ) . bl@@ ur@@ sharp mas@@ king was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a tail = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; tool focused on an image by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used to ensure the protected protected filter algorith@@ m from Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to make a picture to &amp; quot ; re@@ foc@@ uss@@ ing . this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called F@@ IR Wiener filter@@ ing . they can usually launch better results as an in@@ bl@@ ur@@ red mask . they can usually launch it from the menu by using colors Re@@ focusing in the image processing .
in practice the circular thread works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche F@@ altung . the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche F@@ altung . the F@@ IR Vienna In@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ ch F@@ altung is even influenced by the original pixel rate . the F@@ IR Vienna In@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ ts can be influenced in most cases even very strongly affected by the remote pixel . this caused unwanted results .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular thread . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module . for most images the default value should put 1 good results . you can put a higher value if your picture is very in@@ bl@@ ur@@ red then should appear to be hei@@ ght@@ ened .
cor@@ relation : an increase in cor@@ relation can help reduce arti@@ facts . the cor@@ relation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0,5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and max . a high value for the cor@@ relation reduces the sharp@@ est effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; smoking filter : an increase in the noise filter may help you reduce art@@ e@@ facts . however , values higher than 0.1 is rarely helpful . however , values are higher than 0,1 . however , the brightness is very bad . a high value is 0@@ .03 . a high value will continue to taste the image . &quot;
&quot; Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche &apos;s sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your Un@@ sharp@@ ness is caused . in most cases you should use this value to 0 to avoid anno@@ ying arti@@ facts , so you might need to increase the cor@@ relation and / or@@ der@@ less filter . &quot;
&quot; mattress size : this value determines the size of the transformer size : this value determines good results , especially if you choose great values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . however , note that the module is very slow when you choose great values for this parameter . in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
the save and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ jects parameters that you have set for later and can then be loaded on .
try to carry out all the additives , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the image before you use the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image . the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible , but later un@@ pleasant arti@@ facts left . &quot;
&quot; when you read images and comp@@ ress , &amp; eg ; as JP@@ EG , you should apply the module to the un@@ comp@@ ressed image . &quot;
&quot; generally , bl@@ ur better results for sharp@@ ness . this could be caused by this , the bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king used to use a larger neighbourhood than sharpen@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; theore@@ tically , bl@@ ur . even under optimal conditions it is necessary to remove art@@ e@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of the sharp@@ ness . for the Wiener filter you can show that it is the optimal lin@@ e@@ are filter . virtually is the result of the F@@ IR Wiener filter is often better in the processing of small details . &quot;
below you can compare a comparison between different filters on a small un@@ focused image :
the original un@@ sharp paint image must be corrected . this picture was made using a analogue camera . the un@@ focused result is attribut@@ able to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
&quot; for more information about the methods of breeding , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address . &quot;
the reg@@ ler smo@@ othing sets the sharp@@ ness of the area of the di@@ mming in order to generate a natural @-@ light p@@ up@@ et .
the d@@ tin@@ ox enables a customized color for the p@@ up@@ ille . if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones then you can set this here .
the tool artwork is one of the most advanced tool to remove not desired arti@@ facts with be@@ is@@ pi@@ ell@@ os@@ er speed .
the In@@ spec@@ m algorith@@ m was developed by the IM@@ AGE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pres@@ ets as starter points to simplify the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are shown below :
&quot; if you want to use the filter settings in a j@@ us@@ , you can use the tab smo@@ othing and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; Detail@@ view p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of details . a small value leads to a smo@@ ked inc@@ ense over the picture . a value of 0,@@ 9 should get details so that no sh@@ red@@ ness needed is understandable . please note that the detail has always been sub@@ ordin@@ ated to the right @-@ depen@@ dency . &quot;
&quot; Set @-@ dependent bodies Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es uniform@@ ly in all directions , while a value close to 1 only in a direction smoothly . JP@@ EG Ar@@ te@@ e@@ facts are best suited for a value close to 1 . &quot;
&quot; &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smo@@ othing factor over all@@ . p then defines the relative smo@@ othing . put this value therefore to the degree of space in your image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &quot; van Gogh &apos;s turbul@@ ent effect . &quot;
re@@ peti@@ tions : returns on how often the algorith@@ m is going through . usually here 1 or 2 .
&quot; angle @-@ gradu@@ al level since &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ ot@@ rop@@ es Alpha . if Alpha is small , there should also be small . pay attention to that small angle can create a long run . thus , you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs . &quot;
integrated ste@@ pper range &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integr@@ ale ped@@ aling in pixels . you should put the value of smaller 1 to avoid Sub @-@ pixel @-@ smo@@ othing and never greater than 2 . &quot;
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the added quality that you will receive by choice of this option is only minor . it doubles the running time . we therefore recommend it to leave it .
&quot; the buttons Save as and loading exactly this . any setting of image error can be correct , stored in a text file and later re@@ loaded later . &quot;
&quot; picture mistake is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can still take a long time and a high CPU load after itself . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button far@@ ewell . &quot;
below you can see how image mistake with small arti@@ facts can be removed . the module will be applied to a photo that in Guatemala City has been made using a analogue camera . as you see there is a peculi@@ ar black arti@@ s@@ act in the fore@@ ground that caused by poor film storage during the journey re@@ del@@ .@@ The original image is under ( 1 ) to see and the corrected image under ( 2 ) .
the &amp; Pres@@ ence ; Rau@@ sch@@ reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce images . it uses a copyrighted algorith@@ m by Peter Heck@@ ert .
&quot; this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters available , to remove spots and other arti@@ facts found e.g. from dust or hair on the lens , to remove . it can also be used to remove sensor smoking from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ ster@@ ute ; -@@ effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need further information on Sensor@@ ic cameras from digital cameras , you can read this in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the screenshot above shows a typical scene which was made with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ vel@@ ous space that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases you only need the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window advanced settings can remain with the default settings .
&quot; radius is controlled the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) up to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) which is used for the filter . large values increase the time when the filter is used per pixel and allows the image to be wo@@ unded within the image and the color in it is adjusted and thus smaller bugs . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the noise level . this value raises the pixel rate . if it will increase the filter off the filter again , if you change it . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image can no longer receive and smoke or lubric@@ ation occurs once again . &quot;
edges : controls the cant@@ ability for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it &apos;s too strong it can occur not the entire noise or r@@ ator tips can occur . put it on a value close to the maxim@@ s if you want to remove a bull@@ fighting or JP@@ EG Ar@@ te@@ e@@ facts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance of the image . we recommend either color or light density to improve the image . these settings do not affect the smo@@ othing process of the details of the settings .
color : controls the colour toler@@ ance of the picture . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to change a picture . these settings do not affect the smo@@ othing process of the details specified by detail .
&quot; GAMMA @-@ RAY : controls the Gam@@ mat@@ intoler@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dar@@ ker ranges , which typically have typically more smo@@ ked , to increase . it also dirty but also the shadow ranges . &quot;
&quot; atten@@ uation : controls the adjustment of the ph@@ as@@ le@@ j@@ itter@@ ing . this value defined as quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius , when it is becoming high , the edges and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter will appear to the edges . he can remove smoke and is the recommended method for it . &quot;
&quot; under and loading : these buttons are used exactly for this . all parameters can be stored in the rob@@ ber reduction , you can be saved into the file system and loaded later . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of how smoking reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the smoking reduction has been applied with the default settings . &quot;
&quot; sometimes a picture is cr@@ acking for your purpose . the solution , the image is a bit soft to draw , is fortunately much easier than one picture to shar@@ pen . use the pattern on the right side of the dialog box on the right side of the dialog box shows the effect of this operation on your photo . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ sts ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo@@ art@@ ef@@ acts .
&quot; this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your images . it is very well adapted to the Gau@@ ß &apos;s natural rob@@ bers , scrat@@ ches , coll@@ ecti@@ les , scrat@@ ches , coll@@ ecti@@ bles , and thus gets the content as it is also the human eye . &quot;
the same algorith@@ m can be used for colour and tex@@ tures . the Tex@@ mus for restoration was developed by the IM@@ AGE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
&quot; JP@@ EG Ar@@ te@@ e@@ facts reduce : the comp@@ ression of JP@@ EG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as a ver@@ lu@@ sty Com@@ pres@@ sion@@ ism ; - small standards that are in un@@ comp@@ ressed image . this setting should correct these problems . &quot;
the buttons Save as and loading exactly this . any setting of photo migration can be saved into a text file and later re@@ loaded later .
&quot; photo migration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can still take a long time and a high CPU load after itself . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the button . &quot;
below you can reduce like a photo with a @-@ shaped smoke . the module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO has been accepted . you can see the det@@ er@@ ated film bodies on the faces . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo migration . this time Tex@@ tures was reduced to an old color photo that has been used with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ e@@ facts that have been caused by the sc@@ ann@@ er@@ lighting and the phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . the original image is under ( 1 ) to see and the corrected image under ( 2 ) .
&quot; this one came , tool Hot@@ pixels allows hot@@ line of photos that were with a CCD camera , eight were removed . it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pi@@ xi project , protected by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p . &quot;
bright , dead or hot pixel are especially with high @-@ quality raw mode photos a problem since many cameras with JP@@ EG comp@@ ression over a built @-@ in supp@@ ression for hot pixel . &quot;
&quot; this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixel quot ; and &quot; &quot; quot ; bright pixel &quot; . &quot; there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixel . &quot;
download this file in the wizard with the button dark . the tool will detect automatic the hot and bright pixel . these are highlighted in the picture gallery .
if you have an old digital camera it is important that you can take the dark picture directly in connection to discover new hot or bright pixel by CCD defects .
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should invite the right dark picture to the corrected image . note that the wizard will notice the last dark picture and that automatically loads this automatically in the next session . &quot;
the image area and the preview will help you to correct the result inside the picture . the pre @-@ resolution displays the output of the filter with the current settings . poor pixels are empha@@ sized in all curtains .
choose an area around the def@@ ective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ish this pix@@ el@@ blocks . these are the available filters :
&quot; thir@@ st : it is determined an average of the neighbour pixels . the resulting color is assigned to all def@@ ective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line . &quot;
linear : all pixels that have a distance from 1 of the pix@@ el@@ block are pul@@ led to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ D@@ im ) or a group of linear cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ D@@ im ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ed the def@@ ective pixels in the block to inter@@ pol@@ ish .
square : this is the standard filter method . all the pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pix@@ el@@ block are moved to a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ D@@ im ) or a group of square cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ D@@ im ) that is used to be the pixels in the block to inter@@ pol@@ ish .
cub@@ ically : all the pixels with a distance of 3 or less will be drag@@ ged to calculate a bi @-@ kub@@ ical surface ( 2 @-@ D@@ im ) or a group of Cub@@ an cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ D@@ im ) which then used to inter@@ pol@@ ed the def@@ ective pixels in the block to inter@@ pol@@ ish .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixels correction on a color photo shot from a def@@ ective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure to see . the original image was enlarged on 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is under ( 2 ) .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ tization ; vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under@@ lined corners , of an image . &quot;
&quot; vision objective , especially the middle and large photo@@ graphic format , may often use the whole sensor area not uniform@@ ly illuminated . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ i quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they also reduce the light that the sensor can be achieved there . Tele@@ objective will also show this behavior . &quot;
&quot; but he also has dis@@ advantages . many Centers have also need a factor 1.5 or 2 at the aper@@ ture filter , which it is impossible to keep the camera with the hand . far short objective should , also with center @-@ filter , an opening of f / 16 or small , since otherwise anxiety @-@ effective through movement . &quot;
&quot; using the large exposure areas of today &apos;s Fil@@ men@@ ues and the color or gray @-@ type of digital cameras and film @-@ scanner , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a Center@@ filter by changing the transformation of a Center@@ filter on an image . the algorith@@ m is copyrighted by John Walker . &quot;
with three controllers you can control the Vig@@ ni@@ et @-@ correction filter and take three other the exposure of the target image .
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of light ampli@@ fication at the point of the largest density . the standard density is 2,@@ 0 , which compens@@ ate the density to compens@@ ate for a bigger degree of vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it to compens@@ ate for a small degree . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ osity , contr@@ asts and gam@@ ma -@@ settings : the Edit of an image with the vig@@ net@@ ting correction of the pixels . you must rest@@ ing the exposure of the target with these options . the regul@@ ator will only have positive values available , as you will only have to increase the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to raise a fine re@@ ada@@ ption of the goal of the goal , so let the values for illumin@@ ance / contrast / gam@@ ma at zero and use the gr@@ ad@@ ation out of the &amp; digi@@ tization ; image processing from the menu of color gr@@ ad@@ ation . &quot;
this is an example of the vig@@ net@@ ting correction to an image applied . the origin@@ ating image in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a lumin@@ aire and contrast correction was also performed in the image with this tool .
the &amp; Pres@@ enter ; Lin@@ sen@@ distor@@ tion is a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical lenses in photos . it uses a copyrighted algorith@@ m from David Ho@@ d@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric distor@@ tions . colour distor@@ tions can not be corrected with this tool .
the co@@ efficient of the second crest covers the general geomet@@ ric distor@@ tion of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or con@@ v@@ .exe form of the picture .
&quot; the co@@ efficient of the third gr@@ inder has a similar round @-@ effect , flat but on the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot;
the co@@ efficient fourth Gr@@ ades corrected the remote corners opposite to the second crest . if you combine these two can be eliminated any geomet@@ ric distor@@ tion nearly eliminated .
general : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion second gr@@ inder . with negative values can be corrected t@@ onn@@ able distor@@ tions are corrected and positive values of ho@@ ok@@ ing distor@@ tion .
corner : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion fourth Gr@@ ades . this value affects the ranks as in the middle of the picture . for most lenses the &apos; corners of the parameter has changed the sign of the parameter .
zoom : this value scal@@ izes the image size and thus leads to the correction of the first Gr@@ ades through . negative values increase during positive the image .
note : this value j@@ us@@ ement the brightness in the corners of the picture . negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values they increase .
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , illustrated the dialog with a preview the distor@@ tion correct . the values you use for your image will be stored and used at the next start as default . &quot;
the t@@ onn@@ able or porno@@ graphic correction should be carried out before all states or size changes . in the best way you perform this correction as all the first . if you have a picture new to cut and then perform a t@@ onn@@ able correction the effect would be apparent .
&quot; to help you find the best correction to help you view this tool a vertical and a horizontal relief line . move it to an important place , such as the sea side or a wall wall , in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . &quot;
if you have a ver@@ b @-@ shaped distor@@ tion will correct the resulting image of black Cor@@ ners . you can transform this with the cutting @-@ tool in the menu trans@@ forms from the image processing or over the zoom reg@@ ler of this dialog .
for most images the t@@ onn@@ ade correction is enough . the next logical step for some motives like e.g. photographs from the front , frames and paintings it &apos;s the perspective so to correct the all angles at the picture 90 degrees . note that if you keep the camera with your hand you will always keep an easy distor@@ tion of perspective . &quot;
this is an example of t@@ onn@@ able correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected image under ( 2 ) .
the algorith@@ m is based on a method to sim@@ ulate an infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u@@ .org webpage which is re@@ produced under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infrared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left of the window , you can select the area for viewing . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture . &quot;
below the preview you can set two parameters set cin@@ em@@ bodies and cin@@ em@@ sensitive movie . the ISO regul@@ ator changes the amount of film gra@@ ins and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in the conversion . green meadows are white like snow !
&quot; since the filter color channels apply to the re@@ produce of infrared film , especially the green canal makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos , as the colour information are missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infrared fil@@ ming being applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is set under ( 1 ) and the working image under ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was placed on ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of au@@ ra in the over@@ head .
&quot; the digi@@ tization came ; filter film spra@@ ying is a simple one @-@ used tool to re@@ produce film spra@@ ying on your images . this is known from classical high @-@ speed films , such as the B / W Ko@@ dak Tr@@ i @-@ X , known to increase the sensitivity of the movies , the manufacturers of large silver @-@ gra@@ ins of the photo@@ em@@ ul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; the film @-@ effect sur@@ f@@ ect gives your photo a certain mood or appears to move back into the past . if you want to get a tim@@ eless atmosphere released from daily life . if you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , street photo@@ graphic , gra@@ ined sight especially in your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ men photos so you must use this filter . &quot;
&quot; with the regul@@ ator the ISO sensitivity can be used to control the intensity and gran@@ ularity of the bask@@ ets . the default value is , although frequently higher values need to use at ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need even more bask@@ ets , so you can use the filter several times . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the film @-@ body effect on a black / white picture applied . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the working ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ des ; filter oil gem@@ äl@@ de creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright @-@ protected algorith@@ m of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ des ; filter oil gem@@ äl@@ de gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like a oil painting . natural pictures and breast@@ feeding are good for this effect .
&quot; there exist two regul@@ ator to affect this effect . the top sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five out . thick@@ er brush are better suited for large pictures . glaz@@ ed brush are better controlled by the smo@@ othing or , from the other side , the hin@@ dity . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the inter@@ working is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixels large picture is 1 and smo@@ othing 17 .
&quot; the digi@@ tization came ; filter co@@ ats used color and intensity engra@@ ver to create a cub@@ es in the drawing , empha@@ sizes their gra@@ dient in the drawing , are therefore not ideal for this effect . it &apos;s helpful when you could imagine what scene you could have chosen to sk@@ et@@ ce . this would have good pictures to start with it . &quot;
there are two shelves with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper regul@@ ator choos@@ es the stit@@ ching size and the lower j@@ us@@ hes the contrast ) .
this is an example of the pencil filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed picture ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used . the result can be further improved by adaptation of the intensity .
&quot; the Lev@@ ant came ; Filter engraving , your image has been engra@@ ved in 3 @-@ D as if it was in wax . it uses a copyrighted algorith@@ m of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the Lev@@ ant ; Filter engraving is a fast tool to give your images back to a 3 @-@ D effect . he works particularly well with pictures with a simple structure , in which colour does not use the most important thing in the content . the filter uses the differences between colour and intensity , to turn the image into a gray , mon@@ dar@@ ed landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows the contrast to the filter@@ ing . a value of 30 , is equivalent to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the working image ( 2 ) . the depth is 10 % .
with this filter@@ group you can transform a normal photo into a artwork by means of distor@@ tions . it uses protected algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : shares the image in cells and makes it look like it is seen through glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : analog to shaft blocks 1 is the image here in a different version of glass blocks .
&quot; some effects require a long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . you can cancel this effects at any time with the button . &quot;
with this filter@@ group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of sp@@ inal effects . it uses protected algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom ir@@ sharp@@ ness : getting the image along sk@@ inny lines that are at a central point . this sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness a zo@@ oming camera and thus generates a dynamic expression of often in sports photography .
radi@@ al in@@ sharp@@ ness : know the picture by rotation of the pixels by a central point . this sim@@ ulates the in@@ sharp@@ ness of a rotating camera .
dist@@ ressing the image to generate the effect of a non @-@ focused c@@ unning . the object seems to come back into the background .
&quot; movement @-@ bl@@ age : comp@@ ressed the image through horizontal movements of the pixels . this sim@@ ulates the infin@@ ity of one himself linear , z : B : from a car or train photograph@@ ing , camera . &quot;
sof@@ ten@@ ing in@@ sharp@@ ness : know the image soft in the dark and strong in the bright tones . this is ideal for creating romantic por@@ traits , gl@@ am@@ our @-@ photos or to add a warm and subtle bulbs . &quot;
sh@@ ake @-@ bl@@ ur@@ ring : wi@@ ped the image through random shift of the pixels and sim@@ ulates thereby the sharp@@ ness of a random camera .
intelligent un@@ sharpen@@ ed : finds the color bas@@ ins in the image and wis@@ s to change without the rest .
&quot; mos@@ aic : shares the photo into rectangular cells and then created it , by filling with an average pixel rate , new . &quot;
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation using the button .
the shelves are a cute little tool to make rain ro@@ cking on your image . this makes it natural your pictures a wet appearance . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n protected by protected algorith@@ m .
&quot; trol@@ ley size allows the size of the tro@@ phy to change . because the dro@@ ple@@ t size does not automatically grow with the size of the image , it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . number changes the number and density of the drops . Fisch@@ au@@ gen changes the optical effect of the drops on the picture . &quot;
&quot; you can stick with the &amp; digi@@ tization ; image processing is free from reg@@ ent@@ ro@@ wers . use the selection tool to choose the area , e.g. a face to stay freely . if you start the filter rain , the area will stay free of rain ro@@ cking . &quot;
this is an example of the reg@@ iment . the original image ( 1 ) shows a calm sunset and the converted image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the standard values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation so you can bring it through mir@@ rors or rotating into the right orientation . the tools for this can be transformed in the menu , transform or transform@@ ing mir@@ rors . &quot;
photo sho@@ ots is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimum loss of image quality .
&quot; a picture to b@@ lower is simple . the big question is , how can you get a picture bub@@ bles , how can you get rid of the missing information ? how can you get the missing information again ? how can you get the missing information again ? how can you find the missing information here ? how can you see a good work here . try him and you will see it yourself . &quot;
&quot; if a photo has the wrong size , you can change it to the size you want to change size with the tool size . choose to change size in the menu and specify the target values . &quot;
&quot; the tool to change size is used to change linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to enlarge the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool to flour@@ ishing . &quot;
many imaging programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; that came ; used a further developed approach . the underlying algorith@@ m photo was developed by the IM@@ AGE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you must say the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available in the tab New size and are displayed below :
&quot; aspect ratio maintain : when this setting is activated , the original aspect of the original image will be kept in the entry of the new size . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &quot; van Gogh &apos;s turbul@@ ent effect . &quot;
the buttons Save as and loading are used exactly for this . any inser@@ tion for photo can be saved as text file and later re@@ loaded later .
&quot; photo bub@@ bles is very fast when it makes it , but it can still take a long time and a high CPU load after itself . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button . &quot;
&quot; you can see below a sample for photo bub@@ bles , by adding a small color picture to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the Linear standard magni@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; cutting of a photo is not only a commonly performed surgery , but also a commonly under@@ estimated tool to compile a picture . the image processing allows you to create a picture with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drag the rect@@ angle to create . you will then see this rect@@ angle while you move the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you start the mouse button again , the area of the photo will be cut off . this gives you a good overview of how your photo would be cut to the cutting area . you can drag the size of the rect@@ angle by drawing on the corners of the rect@@ angle . a new rect@@ angle can simply create it with the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the cutting @-@ section , use the button of your image processing in the toolbar and the photo is tailored ( C@@ trl + + X ) . use the file save file to save the new cro@@ pped photo . &quot;
&quot; in the preview area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the side aspect that you have defined in dialog . &quot;
&quot; in the tool After side @-@ ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in the high @-@ format the larger value of the height and the width of the width is assigned to the width . &quot;
&quot; the tool to cutting aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . that means it is always the same , regardless of whether you &apos;re cen@@ tim@@ eters , in@@ ce or any other physical size . you can e.g. below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their side @-@ aspect ratio . &quot;
at the right end of the dialog two buttons to c@@ ate the selection automatically horizont@@ ally or vertical .
&quot; in the dialog box , you can use the Max . relation to the range to cutting on the maximum possible , depending on the chosen relationship and orientation . &quot;
&quot; the tool to side @-@ ratio recorded its attitudes depending on the image orientation ( horizont@@ ally or ver@@ tically ) . if you use the Cutting System ( Horiz@@ ont@@ al or Ver@@ tically ) , these settings are stored as default in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data will reflect the cro@@ pped image and not the original one . &quot;
the settings of the combination assistance makes it possible to help you make your pictures better . these help are :
&quot; harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic particles are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . as the third @-@ reg@@ ain , harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles are an opportunity to share a rect@@ angle in similar harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles at the di@@ agon@@ als . &quot;
&quot; Golden centre : the golden centre is a division that is based on various natural growth pattern , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us Mu@@ schel or the leaf blades of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all possible things that we feel as beautiful . &quot;
&quot; the golden division is the ir@@ rational number of 18@@ 03@@ 39@@ 88 ... and it has already been used among the ancient Egyptians and Greeks , which used to give your images and pyr@@ am@@ ids . artist and architects have gathered the golden divisions in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos put together in order to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is derived from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i episode 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 ,
the golden center provides liquid relief lines when you set a picture . these help will be shown below :
&quot; the Golden spiral , you will achieve your goal good results for your photos . compared to third @-@ reg@@ imen , the golden spiral , creates the eye of the spect@@ ator along the line of the spiral , thus creating a symmet@@ rical visual flow . &quot;
&quot; a further rule is the right corner of the golden sand@@ als , also called golden sand@@ als . it should give something that the eye can be in the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects . this something can just be there without the eye to guide it will fulfil its task . &quot;
&quot; the Golden Tri@@ ecke will also lead from the top of the golden sand@@ als . note that , in contrast to harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are no more equ@@ it@@ ous tri@@ angles . di@@ agon@@ als of these lines can place a static object dynam@@ ically . &quot;
&quot; if you are using tri@@ angles for your frame , you create an effect of a professional photo@@ grap@@ hen dynamic sym@@ met@@ ry . try your image to one of the inter@@ sections and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot reach anywhere else . &quot;
the options horizont@@ ally mirror and vertical can be used to reflect the harmon@@ ic sub@@ missions .
&quot; using the button color you can set the color of the auxiliary lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the relief lines can be invisible . in this way you can customize the color of the lines of your current image . &quot;
the Free Rot@@ ation is a tool to rot@@ ate an image at any angle .
&quot; if you make a photo then it &apos;s easy to keep the camera not exactly vertical or horizontal . this creates an image in which the things came about an angle . you can transform this with the &amp; digi@@ tization ; image processing and tool free rot@@ ation . choose to transform@@ ing free rotation , and j@@ us@@ itate the target angle . &quot;
turning your image with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ ders are specified in degrees . with the button pres@@ ets you can set the sli@@ ders up to 0 degree . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture will be shown on the right side .
&quot; for your help , the module makes Free rot@@ ation a horizontal and a vertical line available . move the mouse po@@ inter in the image showing you to fix the two lines . now you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now j@@ us@@ itate the angle as described in previous section . &quot;
&quot; after you fil@@ med an image , you will find unwanted so@@ ckets in the corners . a way of fix it is the function transform@@ ing drop out of the image processing . &quot;
an elegant way to cut the image is the function of automatic cutting . choose one of the following options :
the option Anti @-@ Ali@@ asing smooth@@ es the picture a bit after the turn . notice the above warning .
all prospec@@ tive transform@@ ations are carried out at a fix@@ point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is shown in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares to the corners of your image . the preview will then be automatically re@@ calculated . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective :
&quot; new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas caused by the transformation of pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas caused by the transformation of pixels . &quot;
angle on the left above : displays the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area .
angle right above : displays the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle on the left below : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle right down : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; after adjustment of the perspective , the image will be a little poll@@ uted . for individual adaptation this effect is small , but two adjustments produce a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after you have p@@ airing the perspective , you get unexpected tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way of this is the image with transform@@ ing the cutting from the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the dash@@ board is used to move a part of the image into one direction and move the other part in the opposite . a horizontal pattern is shi@@ fted . in other words , a rect@@ angle will transform the image into a Parall@@ el@@ og@@ ram . you can start this module over transform@@ ing sc@@ aling . &quot;
&quot; sc@@ iss@@ ors your image by pressing the horizont@@ als and vertical angles . you can push horizont@@ ally and ver@@ tically at the same time . a preview of the effect will display you and the new dimensions of the target will be shown on the right of the preview area . &quot;
&quot; to your help , a vertical and a horizontal line appears . move the mouse to an important point , like the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the dash@@ board to adjust your image . &quot;
&quot; after you have performed the she@@ ar , the image will be a bit wis@@ ely . for a single she@@ ar this effect is generally neg@@ li@@ gible , but two sho@@ ot@@ ers is twice as much gener@@ ic and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
after the she@@ ar the image has tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate this is the image with transform@@ ing tri@@ mming from the image processing .
&quot; that came ; needs a number of libraries and other packages to read and write images . the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries comp@@ lies were used . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with the digi@@ tization . &quot;
&quot; due to this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all formats available on your system . however , you will always find JP@@ EG and T@@ IF@@ F below . &quot;
&quot; which came ; show only files in formats to which knows . this happens using the file extension and a comparison of this with a pre @-@ defined list . if the extension is displayed in the list , you can change the file in the image processing . you can modify this list of file extensions that &amp; that . in section configuration you will find further information . &quot;
nearly all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JP@@ EG or T@@ IF@@ F . some cameras allow you to select the format . a detailed description of these formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ came ; supports both formats .
image comp@@ ression is the application of data comp@@ ression drives to digital pictures . thereby redund@@ ant information is reduced to save the image data on a more efficient way .
&quot; JP@@ EG 2000 is also supported . in general there is better , gl@@ atter@@ e results as JP@@ EG with the same comp@@ ression relationship . the 200@@ 0s version can also be saved , if this is specified in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the raw material , you can read in Wikipedia , The lumin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can convert raw material images in JP@@ EG or T@@ IF@@ F with the raw image converter of &amp; digi@@ tised . in the section configuration you will find further information on the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ tization ; &quot;
&quot; &amp; that came ; supports the loading of raw materials only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is in &amp; digi@@ tised . all support cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a brief list of raw materials that came from &amp; digi@@ tization ; &quot;
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these cli@@ ps are often saved in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . it does not have a film editing program and therefore has no built @-@ in possibilities movies to display or edit . if you click on a film file &amp; digi@@ des ; the &amp; k@@ de ; settings for playback of films are used to play the program for playback .

&quot; when you exchange the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well when the initi@@ ale contrast was already very good , then you can perform the first four alignment with the Module white . &quot;
many tools that you need the photo processing are in &amp; digi@@ came ; contain . your description follows here .
&quot; all image processing tools such as Sh@@ il@@ ov@@ ens , sof@@ ten@@ ing , rob@@ ber@@ y , bl@@ ur@@ red , bl@@ ur@@ red , bl@@ ur , bl@@ ur@@ red , the effect on the current image is applied before the filter is applied to the current image . below you can see &amp; quot ; texture &amp; quot ; in this dialog : &quot;
( 1 ) : this pro@@ gressi@@ ves displays the status of the filter on the current picture . links from him permit five buttons to change the compar@@ ative mode of the fo@@ aming @-@ area . these modes are :
vertical parts without dup@@ lic@@ ate . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected proposal .
horizontal divide without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper area shows the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the range below the selected pre@@ pressing .
vertical parts . the left area shows the original and right to compare the effect of the filter .
horizontal divide the upper area shows the original and the lower compared to the effect of the filter .
&quot; mouse over &apos; -@@ style : displays the preview when the mouse is not in the preview area , and otherwise the original . &quot;
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn off to show over and sub @-@ exposure . the colors can be adapted in the general introduction .
( 3 ) : the frame to choose the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and place on the part of the picture you want to see the preview . preview in the left part of the dialogue is instantly updated .
&quot; ( 5 ) : in the left lower corner , here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default . all settings of the last use of the module will be noticed . &quot;
the side@@ bar features indicates essential information about the selected picture and is largely explained by itself . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photographs : displays a summary of the most important parameters in the shooting of the photos . these data origin@@ ate from the EX@@ IF data if this is available .
this rider provides an intuitive maps available based on the Mar@@ ble @-@ Mini@@ program . you can click with the mouse wheel or out zo@@ oming or it capture it while you move the left mouse button . all pictures within this coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . of course it pres@@ u@@ pp@@ oses the your pictures ge@@ o @-@ data .
&amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; is an editor for p@@ all@@ ets files . the application can be used for loading of color chains and for selecting and using colors .
&quot; the p@@ all@@ ets files , which are of &amp; k@@ de ; installed , can either be installed for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your personal folder for &amp; c@@ de ; settings and hot user defined color and un@@ connected colors . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog box , you can select from a list of installed p@@ all@@ ets or browse the folders according to files . &quot;
the cursor is shown in the pal@@ let box as a line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it shows the colour of the color . the color is described under the pal@@ let view . here also the color name can be changed .
&quot; it can also be used to choose from . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cursor to the cursor . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the An@@ cruci@@ z@@ feld Bei@@ m is activated under the button of the cursor , the color is inserted either by the color plate on the cursor . the color will either be inserted either , depending on whether the mode has been selected . this mode can adjust if you choose the An@@ kreu@@ z over@@ write down under Bei@@ m C@@ ursor . &quot;
&quot; a selection which was thus created as described in the last section , can be used together with the promotions , cut and paste . &quot;
&quot; &amp; col@@ ore@@ dit ; uses the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for any color , three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional color name , followed by a further color . if another color can be found in the clip@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; col@@ ore@@ dit . &quot;
the colors in the palette and the output of colours can be drag@@ ged with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find it in the shade on the left side .

&quot; you can choose whether the graph is to be re@@ loaded or whether you want to change the change . &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; you can change your decision later so that later you may change your decision later , you can setup the menu item settings . setup ... , see also . &quot;
&quot; if you open a graph@@ ite shop outside an ongoing &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer , one ; in the file browser or on the command line , you will have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; -@@ instance , or you want to open the load graphs in a sub@@ window of the already running instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option you can save your choice permanently , but also change with the furniture dialog . &quot;
&quot; when you start the program , you can open all the Grap@@ h of your last session . again , you can save your choice both and later . &quot;
you can also specify how the graph should be split into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be chosen freely .
&quot; if you use several pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graphs you will come to a page . however , the page aspect ratio will be ignored . the page may not be filled from the respective parts of the graphs . &quot;
check @-@ in with one to several pages graphs without head@@ line and with another f@@ ont
&quot; the site Renewable load gives the possibility to set the behavior if a file has changed to the hard disk , just win ; from another program . you can set a default ( automatically re@@ load or the program changed ) or the program every time ask . &quot;
&quot; the site opening gives the possibility to set the behavior of &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; if a graph will be opened in a new window ( the graphs in a new window , or set in a sub@@ window of already running session ) or determine that every time is asked . &quot;
&quot; the page structure gives the possibility to set the start @-@ behavior of &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; you can set a standard set ( the files of the last session or not ) or decide to be asked at any time , then . &quot;
&quot; the context menu , which usually appears when one click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; appears , opens further options : &quot;
here you can select under different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms select . the entries as they are described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are :

the K@@ IP@@ I module images read and read tools to invite new images and to assem@@ ble them .
&quot; this module can be used to initi@@ ate new images , to establish new images from external sources and additives . currently , two sources can be used : &quot;
images scan : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner which supports the SAN@@ E project or another source such as Video streams . so that this works you have to installed K@@ oo@@ ka and SAN@@ E .
&quot; if you want to open the menu item images , a dialog you can choose between all available sources on your computer . choose the source of which you want to get the picture . you can also set the default source for the next time . &quot;
&quot; after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears when you can replace the pre@@ defined default values in order to select your image accordingly . see the preview scanning the picture . the estimated file size is displayed in the right , lower corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information . &quot;
be sure that the window will be completely displayed as some settings otherwise are not displayed .
&quot; after you have been using the button scanning scanning , you have to wait until the scan is complete and the window to capture the options of the image file . please note that the type BM@@ P is not comp@@ ressed and therefore very large files . you must also select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image file . &quot;
screen photos you can create after you have selected in the menu Im@@ por@@ ters &gt; Screen foto ... chosen . a window appears in which you can adjust the various screens :
select The complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
&quot; if all your program window is selected , the recording program will disappear , so that you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , you will be read after a short delay , read the currently visible job . if you have read the complete desktop image , the window will be read under the mouse . &quot;
&quot; the delay determines how long screen photo will be waiting before it starts . if you need to switch on other des@@ ktops , you should select this delay highly enough to navigate the time there . &quot;
after the screenshot was customized the dialog options of the target picture with the options described above .

the module extr@@ por@@ ters for Flick@@ r can be used to load images from your computer to a Flick@@ r server on the Internet .
&quot; when you use the module for the first time you use the process of generating a Tok@@ ens . it is thus a comment to Flick@@ r . a browser is started , so that you can register with Flick@@ r . &quot;
&quot; after successful registration , the module can send photos to Flick@@ r website . you will be presented the following page after a successful registration . &quot;
simply close the browser window and return to the program . after you put on Yes you get the dialog to upload photos after Flick@@ r . this will appear in the next section .
&quot; if the module extr@@ por@@ ters started on Flick@@ r for the second time , you will be welcomed with the following dialog , which shows the current access controls . the module currently does not require any other authorization . you will be asked if you want to continue with these per@@ missions . &quot;
&quot; the button photos should be pushed once once you have set all the other options . with this button you can select the photos you want to upload . if you press the phone button , upload the photos to the Flick@@ r server . &quot;
the keywords field can be filled with one by comm@@ a separate list of words . these are added to the image as a keywords during the flood .
&quot; using the options open , friends and Fam@@ illi@@ e , you can set the per@@ missions to your pictures . by default the photos are classified as a private . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the option to load the size of the photos before the upload , the photos will be changed before the up@@ loading in size . the size is taken from the maximum size registered . &quot;
the maximum size can be used to set the maximum height of the images . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains unchanged .

&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module Galerie @-@ Export has still no documentation . in case you are interested in writing , please contact the mail@@ ing list of the K@@ IP@@ I Team under k@@ de @-@ autom@@ aton . attention : the participants in this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical localization allows GPS co @-@ ordin@@ ates in the met@@ adata of an image and edit . the geographical data is stored in the EX@@ IF @-@ keywords of the Image and the localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical localization tools provides tools for images geograph@@ ically in the spher@@ ical coordin@@ ator system , which is used by GPS and Galileo . height , long@@ itu@@ ary , and l@@ ati@@ tudes are being used . &quot;
to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data you need a GPS track as XML @-@ file in g@@ p@@ x @-@ For@@ mat@@ . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ p@@ sman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ograph@@ ical localization cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can lead a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; choose the images you want to cor@@ related to the main window and call the menu . to load up a possible cor@@ relation of time and localization , you need to load a trace file using GP@@ X file . this file contains of course data that have been included in the same places as the images of your camera . &quot;
if the file is loaded a automatic cor@@ relation carried out the coordinates in red below . GPS Sp@@ ur@@ dates are recorded in GMT @-@ time and therefore the camera will be done with GMT . this can be done with time zone . place your camera zone .
the setting for the maximum time deviation are a upper deviation for the GPS time and c@@ ater@@ nity . lies the deviation below the data are combined . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you do not have any trace data from one place for pictures you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the pictures . the difference between 2000 seconds then becomes all pictures in this area cor@@ related .
&quot; the options inter@@ pol@@ ating and difference in min can be used if you don &apos;t have appropriate data . if you know that in reality a local difference between camera and GPS lies , you can put this limits here and then press the button cor@@ related to inter@@ pol@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be manually set with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos on the same place . as the dialogue itself , the coordinates of a call to the next , you &apos;ll need to use the button OK to put the data in the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the local area can also be found with the displayed map , and enlarge it . select the relevant region and enlarge you si@@ e.@@ filling it again and again . the height must always be manually selected , the card can be changed between map @-@ mode , satellite image and a mixed mode . &quot;
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are possibilities to hang the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that the ex@@ i@@ f@@ tool used to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module image gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
&quot; this module can export your albums in a picture gallery of HTML pages compliant with version 4.01 . you can specify the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the drawing is UT@@ F @-@ 8 co @-@ coded to enable the best possible internation@@ alization . &quot;
the module has four riders where the settings can be adjusted . the rider selection allows all the albums to select to HTML . you will need to select these albums only . with the three buttons on the right you will quickly choose a large number of albums . in the area it will appear quickly and the text that appear in the head of the HTML page .
&quot; the tab appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely explained . the option for each picture is created to create a page in which the picture is displayed . otherwise , the image will be shown directly with your standard viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show , displayed . &quot;
&quot; the tab album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be stored with all your related images . choose a folder that includes the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ DC Export , which contains everything there will be created . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the JP@@ EG file format , the EX@@ IF @-@ Bulletin will also be stored in the new pictures . &quot;
&quot; with other color @-@ depth , you can change the default colored deep . this also influences the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the rider Th@@ umb@@ nails will allow you some of the settings from the album tab for the preview images that are small pictures shown in the gallery .
a progress window indicates the user how far the action is . press Enter to break down the process .
&quot; when the module created the pages , the window will not automatically be closed . you can therefore start the programs check if bugs have occurred . the web browser will automatically start to preview the preview of the gallery . press the module to close the module . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL @-@ based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer allows you to look at a selection of pictures and keep on them basic surgery such as Screen@@ ings , zo@@ oming or re@@ loc@@ ates . the viewer can be used with short and quick access to its functions . &quot;
after the start a picture is displayed by default in full screen mode . this can be changed into a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JP@@ EG con@@ sol@@ uble module is a tool to change images without any of your quality .
&quot; this module allows you to store the actions listed below , images in JP@@ EG format without the usual loss of quality and met@@ adata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of the break@@ able storage , it is that the file size is rising , since no comp@@ ressing of the colour information takes place . this can be found e.g. in PN@@ G format . &quot;

&quot; using the import and function of the met@@ adata module , you can copy data from one image to another . select the image file dialog with which you want to copy the file image dialog with which you want to copy the met@@ adata . the data will be copied after you click on the button OK . &quot;
&quot; this function does not work in all formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not in any target format . JP@@ EG is supported by writing . please check out ex@@ iv@@ 2 to see which formats are supported . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG co@@ aster module is a tool to convert a number of images into MPEG video in the form of a slideshow .
&quot; the module MPEG co@@ di@@ erer can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , using a defined length , using a defined length , using a defined length . you can also add a ground@@ water copy . you can also add an audio file at MP@@ 2 or WAV the slideshow . &quot;
&quot; all images will be automatically scal@@ able on the correct size for the selected video format . with this module , it is possible to create a background color for the slideshow . with this module , it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the media you can use the K@@ 3@@ b program . &quot;
you must first select the images that will be packed into the MPEG slideshow . after that , you can start using extras MPEG di@@ ppers . &quot;
the images selected by you will then be displayed on image files in the Portfolio . there you can also change the pictures or the content of the list .
&quot; after you are satisfied with your list , you should customize the other settings . the video format may choose from different formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . PAL is pre@@ set and most likely the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step you should specify the time in seconds the one picture is shown below . a low value creates very sudden , a high against it very smooth image . &quot;
the background color can be set next . in doubt you should leave it in black . the name and the path of the created file you can set under name of the MPEG output file . keep it as possible to adjust the end .
&quot; if you specify an audio file under name of audio source file , you can start all settings tailored to the movie . depending on the speed of your computer . depending on the speed of your computer , you can drink quickly or in all the rest of your computer and enjoy the slideshow , if you are back again . &quot;
&quot; if a note appears that co@@ di@@ ers or tools are missing , you can customize the paths to the programs of the M@@ jp@@ eg@@ tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick packages across the button Settings right below . &quot;
the printer wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper along standard photo@@ p . these combined pictures can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.@@ g : useful to improve and print with the Gim@@ p module for direct expression .
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import your images stored in the raw format of JP@@ EG , T@@ IF@@ F or P@@ PM . &quot;
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Co@@ in . an original study of Him is : do not expect the same results as the software from your camera . sometimes you get with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! .
&quot; first , select the raw @-@ file to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w image converter appears then in the mode for a single image . with the kno@@ b preview you can view the effect of your current settings . &quot;
&quot; you can now optimize the values new j@@ us@@ itate to optimize the conversion process . the first option will decide whether the camera settings are used for the whit@@ eboard . the essential parameters such as gam@@ ma , brightness and red / Blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can proceed to the image later . &quot;
&quot; a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected , so that you can use the contr@@ asting information . if your camera has been working in the R@@ GB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switches has no effect . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the preview , you can select one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . JP@@ EG uses a processed algorith@@ m and produces the smallest file size . &quot;
&quot; the Tagged Image Format , T@@ IF@@ F , keeps all the information of your image and uses the ver@@ lu@@ st@@ free L@@ Z@@ W comp@@ ression . &quot;
&quot; if you have to deal with your images frequently or otherwise you should not use the JP@@ EG format , since it is only a limited number of operations before getting the image quality deteri@@ or@@ ated . T@@ IF@@ F and P@@ PM are better adapted to retain the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you choose JP@@ EG as a storage format , the met@@ adata contained in the raw @-@ file are stored in the JP@@ EG file in the following information . &quot;
&quot; if you have customized your settings , you can start with the execute button button . if you want to cancel this process so you can break it . &quot;
&quot; the stack size mode allows you to convert different images to one time . use this mode therefore , if you are safe , e.g. by testing on a single image which are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images . however , you have the option to automatically over@@ write existing file . however , one preview is not available . however , a preview is not available . the progress bal@@ ancing shows how far the conversion is advanced . &quot;
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in one album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of a album . you can fix the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the time@@ stamp of which will be used . &quot;
&quot; this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can add the image or enlarge , four types of the image changes are available : &quot;
&quot; proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is automatically selected , depending on image orientation , selected . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . &quot;
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here the page is unchanged . you can use this option for e.g. to adjust your image of the screen format .
not proportion@@ ate : not proportion@@ ate size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
&quot; print preparation : prepared the image for print printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photos , including background size , edge size and background color , is adapted accordingly . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred email program . you can also change the size of the desired images before .
&quot; after which you started the panel , the window window will be started with you selected images . using the button images you can add dialog with a file sel@@ ector . for the last selected picture there will be a preview on the right . &quot;
you can also drag images to the picture list and add there to add the list of images to the images .
with the kno@@ b pictures you will remove the selected images from the list of visible images .
once you have selected all images you can open with the button OK the new message window of your e @-@ mail clients . you just have to add the addresses and the subject . the images you selected are also attached to the app@@ endi@@ x .
do not pay attention to many pictures at a time . most e @-@ mail accounts have to send restrictions on the size of the emails . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window will be used to change the settings for the sending of images . your configuration is stored and every time you use it again .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you need to specify in the input field , including the right path for your installation . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail Service , you will need to install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer . you can download this here . &quot;
&quot; after the choice of comments in a attached file , the comments will be added to the pictures into a text file and attached to the mail . &quot;
&quot; the PN@@ G format under the menu image file is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to the ver@@ lu@@ st@@ alls formats such as T@@ IF@@ F . you should therefore have PN@@ G if you have a quick internet connection and the photo quality will not be changed . otherwise , we recommend you the JP@@ EG format . &quot;
&quot; if you select JP@@ EG under pictures file format and the original files in JP@@ EG format are , then the original @-@ Ex@@ i@@ f@@ data will be added to the images there . &quot;
&quot; when the process is finished , the window will not automatically be closed so you can view the status quo in search of errors . your e @-@ mail program will automatically start at the end . &quot;
after the start of the module &apos;s advanced slideshow appears a window with questions as you want your slideshow . you can select here between the selected and all pictures of the album .
&quot; the OpenGL transi@@ tions in the presentation have enabled very elegant image outputs by OpenGL . however , you need to have a corresponding graphic card , since otherwise the slideshow is very slow . &quot;
the file name option ensures that the fil@@ ename of images is displayed in the left lower corner during the presentation .
the Schlei@@ fe option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a final loop . you can then manually enter it manually with Es@@ c ;
the option pictures rand@@ om@@ ly choose that the images are shown in a acci@@ dental order . so it &apos;s not the order of images used in the album .
under delay between the images can be set at the time interval between the individual images . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard . the best distance depends on your computer and the selected over@@ look .
there are more than a dozen over@@ looks between which you can choose . acci@@ dentally , choosing any transition between the images another effect . &quot;
&quot; during the slideshow , you can access a toolbar on the upper left side of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn you . &quot;
&quot; with this toolbar you can hold the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slideshow . &quot;
&quot; on the left bottom of the screen , you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I Module Time &amp; Date j@@ us@@ ort currently has no documentation . in case you are interested in writing this way please contact the mail@@ ing list of the K@@ IP@@ I Team under k@@ de @-@ consulting @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module wallpaper is a tool to put an image as a background for the working surface .
&quot; this module sets up the currently selected picture , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as a background for your K@@ DE Work@@ space . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided your pictures and videos with comments , you can see with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , are now available in people , places and in the group keywords entries . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window you see the categories , for which you have given information as you have information and videos provided with ann@@ ot@@ ations . additionally , there are entries to view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course the current preview pictures . in the following each one is described for yourself . &quot;
&quot; if you press the mouse to the associated entry , the view of the browser changes . see picture . &quot;
&quot; if you choose another person , only the images are shown on which both persons are shown . through this selection method , you can limit the number of images of a few thousand pictures to a few single pictures . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected all the people , places and other settings , you can view with preview images to view the images of your efficiency area . &quot;
&quot; in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of their name . you can save with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person a private preview image , which applies of course also to places , keyword , and other categories you have defined . see the picture . &quot;
&quot; to view images next to the names , select the button , which you choose right outside on the toolbar you choose which view you can see for example symbols with pictures of persons and at the same time a list of keywords will not have appropriate images . &quot;
&quot; you must however specify which image should be displayed for each individual person . in order to see this , you need to see the picture @-@ attached window ( in near@@ er described ) and in the context menu , you can customize the picture for the appropriate person . in the in@@ sured window you can select the enlarge factor according to your wishes and thus choose which part of the image should be displayed and trun@@ cated . &quot;
&quot; if you go to the main window of the story Search , you will see a dialog box next to the capture of the image features very similar . this dialog can be seen on the picture even more . &quot;
&quot; if you want to enter a string into the field lab@@ eling or description , the compl@@ ain@@ ments or descriptions of the images will be search@@ ed for this text . if you want , you can also use a date for example , for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; browse the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all images on certain names as you can see in the picture . here , after pictures , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are pic@@ tured . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you don &apos;t like to read manuals , but rather prefer to try out functions , you have the following alternatives to this hand@@ book : &quot;
&quot; go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , and have a look at the fast entry , the screen photos and the introductory videos . &quot;
&quot; start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and select in the first dialog the demo , if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select the menu help menu item , photo album , and you can try the features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this hand@@ book , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as an integral HTML document to download . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you will see the bar @-@ bar . a picture of this bar see here : . as the name suggests , this bar shows you file statistics about the images in your database . &quot;
&quot; the bar can display several different assets . each bar then shows a different unit . you can switch between the units of months , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by clicking the bars only 10 @-@ minutes . &quot;
&quot; the sched@@ ules can be used in the following ways : you can change the displayed Entries selected from the database ( if you select a date , you will find the first picture of this date in the preview you displayed ) and also displays the current date of the currently displayed images if you navigate in the preview view . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a range of time bar by pressing the mouse button and drag the mouse over the lin@@ e@@ al of the sched@@ ules , so drag the time frame , you &apos;ll be displayed in the preview view only images of this time frame . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a beam of the sched@@ ules . &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you with two options available to create HTML websites with your images . the one is integrated in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated into &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version described above the menu file using HTML ...
&quot; before HTML pages you will need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and destination . in the following , each section is described more accurately . &quot;
&quot; first , enter the title of the rem@@ n@@ ment and a description which is to contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML @-@ example pages you see an example of these settings . &quot;
next you select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file is to be created on the view page . stit@@ ching information on export files can be found in .
&quot; finally , you can choose which information can be displayed on the HTML pages . therefore , you can avoid that information displayed on the HTML pages . for example , that all photos are displayed by a party . for example , that all images are exported . you can therefore not use this option to hide certain images in front of certain considerations . &quot;
&quot; in this area you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most of the settings options are clearly , which is not specifically submitted . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for images . this way , those need to look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no pictures download a resolution of 1600@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewers of your side can change the resolution anytime you have specified . it can then load your images with low resolution , what leads to a lower transmission time . if he wants to get a picture larger , it changes to a higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setting , you place the various folder and the URL which will be stored on your site . &quot;
the best thing to choose for all your HTML files and for each subsequent sentence a new sub@@ folder .
&quot; first , you have to select the main folder where all your pictures are saved . this folder will be saved and automatically added at the next time . this folder you can select either a folder or one of K@@ DE @-@ supported protocol for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your images , you can check if this really is all for viewers will be visible . if you have created for the basic folder name a web browser , after the pages have been created . otherwise , the URL you should start here . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the HTML files do not yet exist in the final destination folder , you have to manually copy it to it . so that the import @-@ function , see , correctly you have to specify the final goal of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the basic folder in which all sub@@ folders . &quot;
&quot; the currently described options have all three on basic sub@@ folders or URLs related . in these , a sub@@ folders created , whose name you set in output folder . &quot;
&quot; if you &apos;re on a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or anywhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; together , you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures . if you have already done a HTML page for viewing the pictures , etc. then you have to do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this work doesn &apos;t even have to do . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . you can import others into your database . the image properties are stored with ex@@ - and imported . &quot;
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in them if the pictures are stored in the file , or whether to store all images in the file , that you can share all pictures and to pass this file as independent . however , the obvious draw@@ back is however the file size . &quot;
&quot; you can create a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the menu File export ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with a HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file looks for the images in two @-@ fold way . firstly the appropriate images are not found , the images of the URL you have specified when creating HTML files . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog for the export of images described by clicking the menu file . &quot;
the most important option of this dialog is whether it is required to act internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
&quot; when option Manual near the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
with the option Automatic in the vicinity of the .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the images automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most pictures have already been comp@@ ressed with JP@@ EG and the XML file itself is quite small . if you want to comp@@ ress the files so simply select the option export file .
&quot; the last option of this page is to limit the maximum image size . if you want to send your friends pictures , the .@@ k@@ im file otherwise would be very large . here you can say the size limit , by example , that each picture is at most 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
&quot; if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu File Im@@ por@@ ters ... select , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described . &quot;
&quot; the wizard to import consists of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , afterwards , in which folder the import@@ ing images are to be copied . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you can customize the category persons of the imported file ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) while this category will be imported into the third dialog box , which are to be imported into the third dialog box which are to be imported into the third dialog box and which categories can be in your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can download the categories of imported file with the categories of your current database . an example of this can be seen on the picture . &quot;
&quot; it has to be easy to browse and view : when you see images , you often want to view images within different book@@ groups &amp; m@@ das@@ h ; if you want to discover images of your Italy holiday and you might want to discover any picture with your friend , you might want to see all pictures on which this friend is pic@@ tured . &quot;
&quot; in this manual you will get the various steps from ( 1 ) Fes@@ tive the information about your pictures , about ( 2 ) the search and watch , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and adaptation . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ album was started as a program designed for managing your pictures . but it has been extended and today it takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual , more pictures talked about photos , but frequently it also closes videos with one . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all his information in the file index.@@ x@@ ml , in the top folder of their images . these are a simple XML file that you can backup on a flo@@ ppy disk or re@@ visions on CV@@ S , where they would like . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; note the folder where your images are stored and used to use this in future Star@@ ts . if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , so you can start a different folder with pictures , you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / Images / index.@@ x@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; via the menu entry settings on photographs ; Set up to a window , with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . in the following section of the user manual , you will discuss the various settings options . &quot;
&quot; links to six different symbols , with which you can call the options of preview and the options for viewers can be provided by clicking on the F1 key button and a click on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; in it was described as you can specify different properties , e.g. people , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; see the dialog , which is used to process existing groups . for each existing group you can choose a lab@@ eling and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in paragraph , sub @-@ categories were already mentioned . in dialogue Options you can create complete members groups , i.e. all the members of a group are set in a group instead of all groups of a medium @-@ member states . &quot;
&quot; in view of the settings options that are available to you , you can choose the same category . with the above mentioned list , you can choose the category you want to configure the category . in the left pane , you will find a list of the current category and in the right a list of the categories . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares his module with other graphics applications , such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image Plugin Interface . information on this website can be found on the homepage of Ki@@ pi . &quot;
&quot; the modules can be called using the modules Mod@@ ules . these modules can and are not described in this hand@@ book as they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , but are not distributed separately . most modules have a help page that you can call on the modules themselves . &quot;
&quot; since the modules are used among several applications together with each other , it may be that the modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; demo database , you can either have the command line with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album , demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or through the menu Help . say not , I would not have war@@ ned them ! &quot;
&quot; the applications that use the modules via K@@ IP@@ I together , are very different , allowing it to be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not work . this is the disadvantage when you share features with various applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications are just a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , this type of order is not supported , sim@@ ulates it for some modules the order to albums , so you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; this sim@@ ulates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , that simply corresponds to the current view , so all the pictures that show you the picture @-@ show at the moment . &quot;
&quot; besides the current album &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , the modules also have to pass a list of albums . here comes &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , as follows : &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser shows the content of a category , for example all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will have the category that you have specified in a series dialog as a category for virtual albums . so if you do , for example , use the category persons , will do &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , so whether you have chosen people to view and pass this module . &quot;
&quot; since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start using dialog box and select the module modules , which modules are to be loaded . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you can see an example of a boot screen , as soon as you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with your own pictures . &quot;
&quot; as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you will see the window , with which you can browse through your images . in the section we will not see a lot of information about your pictures , then click on this window to show you an overview with all the available pictures . &quot;
&quot; one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , is the possibility to get any picture provided with notes . this includes information about the persons who have recorded on the picture , where the picture can be added either individually or for a larger number of pictures certain comments at the same time . if for example , on all pictures Jes@@ per is recorded and all pictures in Copenhagen have been added . &quot;
&quot; all these comments can be used for the Search@@ ing and Brow@@ se , as you can read in the section . if you want to see this ann@@ ot@@ ations if you use the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; you can see three lists with a text field by setting people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; because you will always use it again if you enter information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; the following idea is to shift the images within the list : if you have a family party and are pic@@ tured on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons , you can find that the names used to move upwards to find people quickly and assign them . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to get a alphabe@@ tical list , click on the icon for sor@@ ting by date on the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected ann@@ ot@@ ations for each picture individually , you might want to edit all selected images and provided these pictures with notes . click in this case simply on the preview and back @-@ buttons , which are under the preview of the picture on the right . &quot;
&quot; if you have several pictures , e.g. with the same person , then it can be comfortable to select all these images and to use the menu item for multiple entries at one time with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the United States . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you can view a browser window of the USA as a super@@ group . to show you that it is a group @-@ group , a special icon will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu of the connection menu is it possible to add an entry to an existing or new or sub@@ category . additionally , you can also submit an entry to a category and submit to make this one sub@@ category of this entry . attention , this pres@@ u@@ pp@@ oses that you just sort out your categories alphabe@@ tically . &quot;
&quot; you can move the individual elements of the starter dial@@ ect by comp@@ ose the bodies which form the upper part of the frame , then click and move . you can also draw your own window by drawing him outside of the window . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted the appearance of the window so that you are adapted to your needs , click on the button options ... , which offers you the option to save the current structure and appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also leave a frame completely . if you want to get this window again later , use the button options ... and then window a / hide . this procedure can be seen in the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select the entry pictures in your browser , you will get an overview of the currently selected images , or all pictures if you do not have a filter . you can configure the size of the preview images , by simply drag the mouse with the middle mouse button , configure . try it simple . &quot;
&quot; if you leave a picture on the background of your desktop , this image will be set as a back@@ picture for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you click on an image , this is shown in the picture . if you have not opened a window with a picture of image , a new indicator will be created . &quot;
you can also delete pictures . simply choose the appropriate images you want to delete and press either the remove button or select either in the menu Edit selection . now you can see the window you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you with this problem a solution . you can also use them with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . of course you have to use the pictures somewhere , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . in the picture you can view the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; when not all required pictures can be loaded from the hard drive . &quot;
&quot; images , in which the right upper left is trun@@ cated , are not stored on the hard drive . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 however , the preview images are present , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can view the preview of these images . &quot;
&quot; as you see this function that you want to copy files from the folders and paste it again . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you would like to avoid any hass@@ le , how to avoid penetration of your images , please buy a bigger disk to store all images on it . &quot;
&quot; in the menu pictures you will find a sub@@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , see the pictures that you want to see for other in@@ accessible and click on Current View , you can also select all the pictures that you can see your little sister , and select the menu entry anywhere except current view . &quot;
&quot; so you have specified what images are to be hidden in case of the case . if you specify the laptop your little sister , just choose the menu entry . if you want to get closed the pictures again , click on sperm . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to set a password which must be entered into un@@ locking the pictures . to set up this password , simply select password change in the menu privacy . &quot;
&quot; please consider that this picture protection is not at all very safe . for one , all images on the hard disk and to the other it can access any text file , the password as un@@ encrypted text or delete . this type of password protection serves only to those who are with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar with the view of private pictures . &quot;
&quot; the reason why you manage all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and hours about hours so you can describe them , of course , that you &apos;re looking at some point . for this reason it has a picture _ and video viewer . these can be seen from the preview , as described in . &quot;
&quot; watch the viewer you can see in . it shows of course the picture , but additional all the information you enter over the image , such as who is on the image , when and where was it done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the Info@@ box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , so you can easily drag and drop down , which information is displayed and whether all these options are available after a right @-@ click on the viewer . the following context menu can be seen below . &quot;
&quot; some words in the Info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here , see , matching entries to this . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you have selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have loaded multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them and go back by using the buttons image high and picture . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these features are also accessible from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if multiple images are loaded in the viewer you can run it as slideshow . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , then loads a new image after a few seconds . how often it can press a new image by clicking the C@@ trl key and Plus or minus . &quot;
a very useful capacity of the be@@ holder of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is used in full screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the complete place on the screen . simply use the input button to switch in full screen mode and back .
&quot; when you use the viewer you can easily move in the image and pull out . to the Her@@ to@@ o@@ omen you can easily get a rect@@ angle . with the Min@@ us key you can drag the plus button zo@@ om@@ t in the middle of the picture . shows how a zoom rect@@ angle can be highlighted in the middle of the picture and shows the result of the zoom . &quot;
&quot; with the point button you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not shown to zoom in . with the equ@@ it@@ key sets the zoom , so that every pixel is comp@@ lies on the screen of a pixel of the image . &quot;
note that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations that are working in videos that are in and out with Plus@@ - and Minu@@ et key .
&quot; with the screen@@ functions from the context menu , you can turn the image . this does not work with videos . you can make comments on the current image using the menu item remarks in the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when you look at pictures it can happen if you have a picture with a person , whose name you have forgotten on the image . in the moment you can read the watch and configur@@ ing dialog of the picture to enter these names . however , you will only consider the picture to mark and see more pictures . &quot;
&quot; a further situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to see images on paper . to see which photos you want , you can start the viewer with the pictures and select them as good or bad , while you see one by one . &quot;
&quot; for the two examples above there are the possibility to provide pictures with similar features , while you can view them . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can set a characteristic that you press the appropriate letters . in view a picture where the characteristics A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; once you have set characteristics on your images , they can be displayed in your browser . you can see all the pictures you edit , print or whatever you have selected , so you can simply use one module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you just want . &quot;
&quot; categories and special features can be displayed in the preview view . if you can view categories in the Pre@@ viewing view , then you can simply add the letters to the images by clicking the picture after the picture was selected . this can be seen here : &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case allows you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; on the image to paint .
&quot; the mixture is not saved with the image , but in the database . in the way you can turn your gut later . &quot;
&quot; in you can see an image on the painted . to view the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , select On the picture paint from the context menu . to finish the m@@ alen simply press the cross at the top of the window . &quot;
&quot; to work with &amp; k@@ pov@@ model ; you must not fully rule the application of the program &amp; Pov@@ ray ; but not fully rule , but documentation on &amp; Pov@@ ray ; should you necessarily be read and understood . &quot;
in the object @-@ tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are shown in the object properties and the object in the wire pattern is shown in yellow .
&quot; you can also select several objects simultaneously , but not the sub@@ object of an already selected object , since all sub @-@ items are already selected using the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the menu entry . &quot;
&quot; there are several possible positions , the following op@@ enable @-@ menu appears , so that you can choose the right position : &quot;
delet@@ ing either from the menu bar under Be@@ am or from the context menu of the right mouse button you can remove selected objects from the scene .
&quot; if you have altered properties , click An@@ turn to take these changes . have you invali@@ d values indicated . then you can change the input errors and then click on to address the changes in time . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the path to the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; -@@ user documentation in the dialog box , you can view the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; -@@ reference to the displayed object with help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this property . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.5 contains already the user documentation . &quot;
&quot; if you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview of your own . &quot;
&quot; press preview in the peculi@@ arity view , and a small example of the scene is set out using the selected texture . as pres@@ et@@ ting , the entire texture will have been selected , even if you want a sub@@ ordin@@ ated element ( for example a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , take down locally . &quot;
the screenshot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these check@@ points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation will be chosen , the check@@ points will disappear and there will be a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shi@@ fts . you can change the shi@@ fting by drag@@ ging with the mouse inside of the window . &quot;
each object has the Wi@@ thin model of a view level . you can specify this value relative to the visibility of the higher level or as absolute value . objects are only displayed if they are selected or their visibility of the selected point of view of the scene .
&quot; &amp; Co @-@ model models , has a window order as preference . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right . &quot;
&quot; if you do not like the default window order or if you need any other order , you can set them any number . you can also save several shut@@ ters and easily switch between different arrangements . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window over or under a present view , drag the drop to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle shows then the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the drop to the right or left side of a view . the new view will then be an@@ cho@@ red on the right or left side of this view and extends over the whole height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to arrange several opinions on each other , drag the beg@@ inner to a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the card @-@ card top in the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window of shut@@ ters are p@@ ending views , views that are not an@@ cho@@ red in the main window . to solve a view out of the anch@@ oring , drag the beg@@ inner to the desktop or click the little to the left above left arrow in the pin . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the pin bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between arrow and cross . &quot;
&quot; you can insert additional views on the main window . in the menu view , you will find entries for any type of views . new views are flo@@ ating , you can anchor her to any place . &quot;
the current window view can save you with view window ... to save it . it will be shown a dialog in which you can save the window order under an existing or new name .
&quot; if you have created a scene , you can ren@@ dering them . &amp; c@@ pov@@ model ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for ren@@ dering , this program has to be installed properly . as this manual was written . this version is currently being installed in &amp; c@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 not supported . &quot;
&quot; to ren@@ dering the current scene , click on the symbol Ren@@ ders The symbol Ren@@ ders in the toolbar or select the menu entry view page . &quot;
&quot; an audio mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Pov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image and quality of ren@@ dering . if you want to insert a scene in different images and quality levels , you can insert as many R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview of up to high quality . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the icon of The R@@ ender settings in the toolbar panel or in the menu view page , select the following dialog : &quot;
&quot; each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it is a name that can detect the properties of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the card card size you can enter the width and height of the framed picture . if you want to ren@@ ch only a small area of the picture , select the cross @-@ section under@@ cut down and give the image @-@ section to ren@@ dering into the input fields . &quot;
in Com@@ bination field quality you can select the properties that is used &amp; Pov@@ ray . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user Re@@ flexi@@ ons illumination . a detailed description of the R@@ ender features can be found in the user manual on &amp; Pov@@ ray .
&quot; when a picture is converted with only one beam depending on the pixels , there may be different mistakes . these images often do not display a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or ste@@ pping effect in cur@@ ves and lines , in addition details are not shown if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing . &quot;
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; uses a technique named anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of this error . in general we see pictures with this property .
&quot; if you turn off anti @-@ ali@@ asing , comp@@ ose and connects &amp; Pov@@ ray ; more than a beam depending on the pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Pov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is a adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because every pixel is further divided into force , and adap@@ tive because every pixel will continue to be divided and adap@@ tive because the recur@@ sive functions depends on the calculated colours . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray makes a beam depending on the pixels . if the difference between the color values to be notified on the given shaft , then a grid of 4x@@ 4 additional points will be calculated at a lowering of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixel will be calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then : &quot;
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between the color values indicates the pre @-@ given shaft , then the pixels is divided into 4 sub@@ sections which can be pursued individually and on further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of recur@@ r@@ sion can be set with the lowering . &quot;
&quot; another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is dimin@@ ished is the production of noise for the beam process , called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you turn on j@@ itter@@ ing , changes &amp; Pov@@ ray ; the rays to avoid a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
&quot; the last setting for quality of Ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; , the diff@@ use light reflection . it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property . &quot;
&quot; on this card card , you can adjust if the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent , if the associated beams have no object taken . &quot;
&quot; opens a new window for viewing the &amp; Pov@@ ray . -@@ Con@@ sole Output . if &amp; Pov@@ ray is finished , you can find the reason for it here . &quot;
to import a &amp; Pov@@ ray ; select the menu file recording ... and select a file in the dialog box .
currently &amp; k@@ pov@@ model ; not yet the complete command @-@ catch of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; . if the error messages or al@@ erts appear , a dialogue window shows a list of all messages . &quot;
if you are not supporting sourc@@ ec@@ ode in &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; write this source text between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ End .
&quot; you can drag objects from object tree in the editor to import the sourc@@ ec@@ ode for &amp; Pov@@ ray . this adds the code text file in the editor . to import objects in the scene , just highlight the code text in the Editor and drag it in the object tree . &quot;
&quot; with copying and inser@@ ting in &amp; c@@ pov@@ model ; and in your editor you can insert source code for &amp; Pov@@ ray , too . &quot;
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ pov@@ model ; one scene is ren@@ dering . usually this Pov@@ ray or x @-@ Pov@@ ray .
&quot; if you click on help in your own publishing view , opens &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . place the path to your documentation and version . now , the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 . &quot;
&quot; Pov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example elevation data ) in the paths to the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; -@@ libraries . if you include files , which does not occur in the folder of the scene , you also need to list the path to these files here . if a file is stored in different paths of the library , the first found file is used . &quot;
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for viewing the selected objects .
the colour for the check@@ points . the second color is used for viewing the selected check@@ points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window @-@ type identi@@ fiers .
you can adjust the object @-@ catch of the points on the R@@ aster in the context menu of the wire model . you can adjust the R@@ aster separate for shi@@ fts , sc@@ aling and rotation . &quot;
&quot; larger values result in a more precise wire model and thus a better stit@@ ching for the objects displayed , but require more time to ren@@ dering . for some objects such as the ball can set the detailed stage for two directions . &quot;
&quot; if you cross the High Detailed view for advanced proj@@ ections , all wire model will be further divided , if the camera is an advanced projection . extended proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions to the perspective and the sen@@ k@@ right proj@@ ections . this property gives a better approach to the proj@@ ections , but requires more time to ren@@ dering . &quot;
&quot; when you display wall , a wall is mounted behind the objects . the wall is shown in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colours . &quot;
if you display floor down a floor below the objects is broken down . the floor is shown in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colors .
&quot; if you activate the addi@@ ction , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method used for the ren@@ dering of the scenes . the values for depth and thres@@ holds can be set . more information about the parameters can be found in the section R@@ ender modes . &quot;
&quot; on this page you can alter existing shut@@ ters or create new window frames . in the section window , you can create and store shut@@ ters . &quot;
the Com@@ bination of standard diagram : displays all existing shut@@ ters . &amp; c@@ pov@@ model ; used the chosen window order when starting the program .
the list of existing shut@@ ters shows all existing shut@@ ters . a new order allows you to add and delete a selected arrangement with the button Rem@@ ove .
each window of the window is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
&quot; the list under the name shows all views for the chosen window of the window . new views can be added by the button Add , and select selected views with the button Rem@@ ove . &quot;
&quot; the position of the new window . with New column create a new column on the right hand of the existing window , with card card , you will find the window below the existing window , with card card , and the view not in the main window , but generates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you have just installed a Pov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ pov@@ model ; installed and now you would like to start without more accurate knowledge of the two programs . if you can follow all steps in this guide , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene , among beg@@ inner very popular : one sphere on one level . &quot;
&quot; but you should observe the following warnings carefully before you decide as a result only a black screen . if you use a 3D @-@ program for the first time , you should consider these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied to ren@@ ders as a result you get a black image . &quot;
&quot; if you do not fit light sources , your whole scene in the dark and you will receive only a black image . &quot;
if you have everything fails to install you at the first start of &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; the following pre@@ set shut@@ ters :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the available symbols of the toolbar . please read the documentation so that you can expect an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this programme .
&quot; these menus and symbols are often used now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ pov@@ model ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you first need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu entry . so you now have a scene without objects . &quot;
the wire model view shows how the camera looks the whole scene which you generate . in particular notice the scene from the view of the camera . this is the result of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the ren@@ der@@ ns of the scene .
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if they click on it , you will find the content of the item object properties in which the various parameters of the camera can be found . in the user @-@ documentary about &amp; Pov@@ ray ; please refer to more details . &quot;
&quot; do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is later reference , but note that the camera can change in viewing control points , with which you can click the camera point in view of the camera . simply click with the left mouse button on a check@@ point and drag it to the desired location . &quot;
&quot; if you press the button or edit the button paste , change the Wi@@ thin views and the object tree immediately according to these settings . as a result you see the scene from the view of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are lots of ways to create the soil for the scene . you could include one Qu@@ ader ( In@@ sert body qui@@ ader ) and the size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but that is a cum@@ ber@@ some method for solving this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; offers actually a simple possibility . you can use an infinite level as floor :
&quot; a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the button or edit the button . in the object tree , the new name is immediately displayed . &quot;
&quot; the wi@@ re@@ model view now shows the level as well as at the moment only a limited level . if you ren@@ dering the scene , stretches the layer to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; if you watch the object tree , you will notice that you can check the item for each new object . in this case you will see the different parameters of the object . in this case you will see the different parameters of the object . in this case you will see only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shi@@ fting . select one of these options , also change the possible settings in the view of the object properties . &quot;
&quot; in this scene you should move the ground to exercise a unit under the horiz@@ ons , just to get to know some of these parameters . select shift and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; only choose the ground in order to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something simple at the moment . &quot;
&quot; in both cases a dialogue can be inserted in which you can choose how the object is inserted , then select the object . you can change the name in the property view ( name = floor Pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button preview you see how the pigment now looks . &quot;
&quot; of course , the preview of pig@@ ments only shows a matt black material , because you can still need to enter the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview . also give you the colors for the pigment . also , there are again many possibilities , but now take the sim@@ pl@@ est . &quot;
&quot; if you do not see any color on queu@@ e and ball , please click on the button below and then call the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is now right now . if you wish to ren@@ dering your picture by clicking on the icon , you should receive the following result : &quot;
&quot; of course , this is not the far@@ es . you have expected to insert two new attributes . in the colour list you need two new attributes . then choose this entry twice ( you can do this also more common , but the chess board list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
choose in object tree each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
&quot; this step should you already be able to perform , since you should have understood the fundamental method of &amp; k@@ pov@@ model ; the ball can be understood just as simple as the ground : &quot;
&quot; in the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings . sit down the value for radius : to 1 ( forget the ball in touch with the ground . otherwise , the ball would flo@@ at with the ground . otherwise the ball would flo@@ at around the ground as you moved the floor around one unit down . &quot;
&quot; of course , the ren@@ dering is now a strange result : as previously seen before , the ball @-@ surface appears like a matt black material . put in the following step an appropriate material . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the ball , you can now give it a material . as already in the floor , you give the ball a pigment as color : &quot;
&quot; choose the sub@@ object and change the name for example in sphere Pig@@ ment . click the ball pigment , select then plain and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; however , you can achieve more interesting effects when you take the time to set some Finish properties : &quot;
&quot; then change the values as in the following screenshot , and click An@@ c@@ aste , or press Enter . &quot;
&quot; the settings shine @-@ effect and reflection already result in partly good visual effects , perfect for glass or ch@@ rom@@ ed surfaces , even if metallic : not yet selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of what options you &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; offers . hopefully you have already learned so much that you can easily , but beautiful scenes can be created . &quot;
Ray@@ tr@@ ay@@ cing is a ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
&quot; when you choose a scene ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en , the ren@@ derer fet@@ ched hyp@@ othe@@ tical rays from the perspective of the spect@@ ator ( i.e. from the camera that affect the scenes and broken , the visual effects of light sources in the scene and as well as atmosph@@ eric effects as such as fo@@ g . thus , the scene of pixels was processed for pixels . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you will see without a camera anything , the camera is your eye , with which you consider the scene . without a light source you can see nothing , the picture is simply black . obviously any scene which should be rendered to some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . Pov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ inc .
opens a file . in the standard file dialog you can select a file that you have previously created with &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ;
&quot; whenever you open a new model or create a new model , the file will be inserted in this sub@@ menu and replace the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already saved the model , it is saved under the same name . it is a new file , you must enter a name and disk space . &quot;
introduces the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage will be added .
you can select this menu item only if you have not saved stored changes in the scene .
&quot; repe@@ ats the most recently re@@ usable command . this menu entry can only select , if you have used back@@ sli@@ ders . &quot;
saves the current window order and opens a dialog box when you enter a name for a new order or an existing arrangement .
&quot; in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ pov@@ model ; here you can change the look , the keyboard short@@ cut and the standard behavior . &quot;
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can change or add a new option with this option .
opens a dialog to set up the toolbar . you can add and remove with this option tool@@ shed for &amp; k@@ pov@@ model@@ er ; - commands and remove .
a B@@ ump Map is a way to absor@@ b surfaces without any coil on the surface individually and change without the geomet@@ ric form of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for a dump map as well as for a texture map .
&quot; basic body are simple geomet@@ rical shapes , which you can use as building stones : very complex 3D models are created from dozen or even hundreds of this basic body . these models will then continue to give them a realistic appearance . &quot;
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel base using an image file as colour card .
&quot; &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable imaging and web browser . the application has a file browser , where you can choose images to display . &quot;
images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the picture or in full screen mode .
&quot; the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files , which you can display with clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n . &quot;
you can adjust if any image should be displayed in a separate window or whether all images are always used to use the same window .
&quot; if you are looking for a particular file , just tap the first character of the fil@@ ename in the right corner . then a small input field is found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by dr@@ aps from Return or &amp; Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; in dialogue - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; there are five card @-@ cards . in three of them , General and editing and slideshow , you can set the way of working &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; set in the two others , short @-@ command for the display and short @-@ command for the browser , can be defined the keyboard short@@ cut for the respective window . &quot;
&quot; this is selected , then the pictures are open in full screen mode . if the image is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the ad space filled with the background color you can continue below . pres@@ et@@ ting is not a full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; is this point activated , loads &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; already the next picture in the folder , while you have the current picture . this reduces the delay , if you choose the next picture , and is particularly suitable for a slideshow . &quot;
with this option saves &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; when ending the name of the last opened folder . the next start opens &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; this folder in the browser window opens .
&quot; click on the colored beams to choose a background color . it is used in the background to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if the window is bigger than the image , the background is filled with selected color . &quot;
&quot; you can create &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show , so setup that only some of the file types can be displayed , which the program can also be depic@@ ted . &quot;
this option is enlarged for large pictures the display pattern on the full screen . this option is switched as preference .
determine whether the slideshow is to begin with the first image in the folder or the selected picture .
&quot; the time span between image changes in a slideshow . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the sli@@ ders or the small arrows right next to the input field . default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; the number of re@@ peti@@ tions . if this value is set to 0 , the slideshow is repeated until they enter the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the sli@@ ders or the small arrows right next to the entry field . default is 1 . &quot;
change here the keyboard short@@ cut for the different modes of operating &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the card @-@ cards short set for the display and short commands for the browser .
&quot; with this option , you turn off between the two @-@ part view of the fil@@ es@@ ystem ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window . &quot;
shows big symbols for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short@@ list .
displays small symbols for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short@@ list .
displays preview images for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short@@ list .
the image is reduced by 10 % . the factor is referring to the current size of the picture .
enlarged the image by 10 % . the factor is referring to the current size of the picture .

&amp; show@@ photo ; is a project that is supported by a community . that means that users and developers can help each other . if you are a common user of &amp; show@@ photo . however , you can ask questions to other users of &amp; show@@ cases . in this mail@@ ing list , however , you can answer any questions of other users in this mail@@ ing list . in this mail@@ ing list it is spoken English as you should have been powerful . &quot;
the best start to take part in the show@@ casing ; it is the developer mail@@ ing list to join the developer @-@ list of mail@@ ing list of &amp; show@@ photo .
&amp; show@@ photo ; tries to give you as much control over your work processes as possible . there are many options to set the behavior of &amp; show@@ photo . to set up the Settings dialog box is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these settings by pressing on the symbols of the left side .
&quot; in the field of exposure indi@@ ct@@ ators , you can choose the color that is displayed when the sub@@ - or over@@ bel@@ ating indi@@ ct@@ ator should be selected . dex@@ ter@@ ing should display a bright color and over@@ heating a dark color . &quot;
the main window of &amp; show@@ casing ; owns a side@@ bar at the right edge that provides you with important information and actions on the selected images . you can also view this page in which you click on one of the five riders :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to scan of pictures that do not make more than images to scan and p@@ ump@@ ed .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an easy application to scan and p@@ ans . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; can save for each image file with automatically generated names and format . the user can display the images in front of the window with automatically generated content and format .
you can check the status of the support of your scanner on the SAN@@ E project page by clicking the necessary information on this search site : http : / / www.s@@ ane @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; with the command sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in terminal can be opened or if no standard scanner is specified then a dialog to choose the scanner is opened .
&quot; the user can select the sc@@ ending scanner and press OK to open the scanner . break down &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite , stop . &quot;
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not treat these options especially .
&quot; to record a picture , the user can only start a pre @-@ off and then start scanning area for the final scan . the pre @-@ out can be started by the Preview button . &quot;
&quot; to select the image better , the user can enter into the image and out of the current selection out zo@@ oming . it can also set the zoom that the complete preview will fit into the window . &quot;
when the picture has been selected then the final image can be read with the scan button .
&quot; when saving a preview view in the settings , then the image will be displayed in a pad@@ lock , as shown below , then the photo is stored and s@@ ley ? en leads to a far@@ thing and you get back into the main window . &quot;
&quot; by the kno@@ b settings , the named dialogue will be opened before the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot;
&quot; the user can view the image if desired , prior to saving . in this case the option will not be displayed before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option needs to be selected . &quot;
this setting allows you to select the kind like &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; images can be displayed . dialogue to save each picture opens the dialog before each one to save the folder in a previously defined folder and then you need to ask for a fil@@ ename .
&quot; this setting defines where images can be saved on the option save without having to saved after a fil@@ ename , then this folder will be used as default for dialog to save . default is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... &quot;
&quot; this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the automatically saved images and is furthermore the suggested name for the image in dialog to save . the automatically stored image gets updated when an image is stored . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers . &quot;
&quot; the user can customize the image quality . this value also changes the comp@@ ression rate when saving . if select the image quality is not selected , then the default value is used by Q@@ t . &quot;
&quot; the kno@@ b Help will start the K@@ DE assistance with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; -@@ manual . the button Over starts the K@@ DE About @-@ Di@@ alogue for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; . the button Settings indicates the dialog for the settings and the left can be used to end &amp; order . &quot;

&amp; AMAR@@ OK ; used like all other programs ke@@ et@@ ches . below you can setup a list of this p@@ ellets and its function . the Global keyboard short@@ cut can set up ... select by the right mouse button in the player window and select the mouse button in the player window and select short @-@ command ... select .
you may set up existing multimedia buttons so setup that they work as &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; -@@ short @-@ command work . this makes your keyboard to the &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; -@@ check@@ center .
&quot; the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general features , which is mostly available in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions , player , playlist , play@@ lists , play@@ lists and scripts . an example call for the D@@ CO@@ P function &quot;
AMAR@@ OK supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; . additionally , Amar@@ is still has some own command line options . &quot;
&quot; you should give the user a refund if the script should not be executed due to a lack of dependence . please check out in your script , whether all required modules are available and use the dialog box , so that the user does not run . &quot;
Beg@@ in require &apos; Kor@@ un@@ dum &apos; Rescue Lo@@ ad@@ Er@@ ror error = &apos; Kor@@ un@@ dum ( K@@ DE bind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bind@@ ings v@@ 3.4 is the for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit
&quot; in the folder scripts / templates , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as basis for your own scripts , or simply to expand the functions required . you will quickly determine that writing scripts is relatively easy . &quot;
&quot; with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts data can be controlled with amar@@ ok and Amar@@ ok . the easi@@ est way is the use of the command d@@ co@@ p ; which each K@@ DE installation should be attached . &quot;
most scri@@ pting languages allow the execute external programs and commands . in this way the function Ex@@ ec ( ) can usually be called Ex@@ ec . here is an example in Python :
&quot; &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; send messages to all current scripts . for this reason , scripts should be constantly monitored and react according to events . of course , a script should also ignore the events if there is no use for it . &quot;
configure the script to view the furniture dialog . to display the storage and loading of the furniture dates . if a script is started when a script is started using Amar@@ ok the work@@ piece on the folder where all data should be saved .
&quot; track@@ change sign@@ alized that a new piece is played . the script could now ask for example ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions , further information on the new piece ( for example the met@@ adata or the substr@@ ate ) . &quot;
vol@@ um@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume signals a change of volume . the new volume is an int@@ eger between 0 and 100 .
&quot; custom@@ izing Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu item@@ Tit@@ le , contains the path to the selected files of the playlist , you can use the D@@ CO@@ P function d@@ co@@ p AMAR@@ OK script add@@ ve@@ Custom@@ er@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu item@@ 24.de / It@@ em script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu item@@ 24.de ) . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; AMAR@@ OK , or if the user stops a script , sends &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to complete e.g. the storage of data or configuration settings . &quot;
Amar@@ oks script administration can also install script packages that can be downloaded by a web@@ server ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) which can be optionally available with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) which can be optionally available with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) which can optionally be recognized with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) that the user can clearly recognize the archive as Amar@@ a script .
&amp; AMAR@@ OK ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the Advanced package . for this reason you should ren@@ ame your script packages right properly .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) the remaining to lad@@ der modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameters to get the file right :
&quot; if your script is ready , you can load it on www.k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.org and attach the link to the wiki script of &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps , you should use the category AMAR@@ OK ; script . &quot;
&amp; AMAR@@ OK ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; has many useful and powerful functions and is still surprisingly easy to use .
&quot; with &amp; AMAR@@ OK , you can simply drag music to the playlist rather than through endless menus included in your collection . with &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; &apos; s collection browser and the quick search you will find the piece within seconds . &quot;
&quot; maybe you have already some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which you would like to hear ? then the playlist browser is just hard for you . and if the decision is still hard to choose the dynamic mode and the intelligent play@@ lists automatically sets the right music according to certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; AMAR@@ OK has an excellent support for Ap@@ ples iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many more useful features make Amar@@ ok for the most advanced audio player . AMAR@@ OK is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right to experience your music ! &quot;

&quot; voting for the music files , this function is only available when &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . otherwise , the .@@ mood files in the Settings folder of &amp; AMAR@@ OK , stored ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / AMAR@@ OK / m@@ ood@@ bar / m@@ ood@@ bar / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) . &quot;
&quot; external browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; AMAR@@ OK , started when a browser is needed . &quot;
&quot; use other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser , which is not located on the list above . &quot;
&quot; playlist when loading , save the current playlist automatically with the end of &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist at the end . &quot;
&quot; relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : when you activate this setting , &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , otherwise use the absolute position of the music files . &quot;
&quot; up @-@ to @-@ date scale , the play@@ lists can be visible in order to keep the play@@ lists window , in order to keep up the current piece always in the visible window range . &quot;
&quot; in the case change to the context @-@ browser , automatically displays the context @-@ browser as soon as the next piece is played . &quot;
in the section Ap@@ pear@@ ance you can customize and AMAR@@ OK ; the section is in three parts sub@@ part .
&quot; in the fonts section , you can use the use of different scri@@ ptures in &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; you can choose fonts for the following field : play@@ lists windows , player window and context browsers . press to choose ... , so you can choose a desired f@@ ont from the selection dialog . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of custom paint sch@@ ema you have even set the qu@@ al of your choice , and can set your own color scheme . apply to the same colored shades for front and background color . &quot;
&quot; playback at the start , brings that &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; after program start the reproduction automatically generated with the piece at the spot , with which it was stopped in the last be@@ aming process . &quot;
the under@@ window on @-@ screen display allows you to switch off the O@@ SD . when On @-@ screen display a preview of O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview .
the first option is the f@@ ont . click on select ... to select the desired f@@ ont for the O@@ SD . the An@@ kreu@@ z shade will be shown that the text is sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
&quot; own colors use gives you the possibility to adjust the O@@ SD colors for writing and background . one click on the color areas opens the dialog to select colours . if the colors use is not enabled , the pre@@ set menu is used ; -@@ colors are used . &quot;
the input field display text displays the text shown in the O@@ SD . due to the type of space holder the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below you will find a list of available measurements and what they mean .
the display screen is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to specify on which screen of a multi @-@ disk environment to appear on the O@@ SD .
the card @-@ card audio @-@ edition lets you select an audio driver from the selection box . some drivers enable further adjustment possibilities in this card card .
the card card collection is used for setting all settings for your collection . it includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folder that is to browse &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; in order to include a folder into the collection , select the An@@ kreu@@ z@@ feld near its name . this section also contains An@@ kreu@@ z@@ felder to display , as is to be used with selected folders . &quot;
sub@@ folders browse through : this causes that &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; both the crossed as well as their sub@@ folders according to music .
&quot; changes : enables &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; to monitor the selected folders on changes ( e.g. if music files added or deleted ) . furthermore , a incre@@ mental search is done to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
play@@ lists import that &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; all found play@@ lists in your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection adds later to the play@@ lists .
the part of the collection database is used to choose a database for the collection . the Com@@ bination field driver : can you choose between SQ@@ Lite and My@@ S@@ ql . if My@@ S@@ ql is selected , another facility is required in the sub @-@ window My@@ S@@ ql . &quot;
&quot; the My@@ S@@ ql setup section is used for setting the database for &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; under computer : the computer will enter , where the My@@ S@@ ql database is included , under which the database is att@@ ain@@ able under port . name : is the database name to which the connection is made . &quot;
use user name : and password : to enter the data you need for connection to the database .
the card @-@ card last@@ .@@ fm controls the support for last@@ .@@ fm a . &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; the names of played st@@ aps to a pay@@ .@@ fm server transfer and create music recommendations in regard to the current piece .
&quot; here you enter your username and password for your load @-@ fm profile . if you do not have a profile , you can add one on the last@@ .@@ fm website . &quot;
&quot; then send the profile and update the profile : this setting enables it &amp; AMAR@@ OK , to send the names of the different pieces to your load @-@ fm profile . &quot;
&quot; similar interpre@@ ters retri@@ eve : after activation of this setting is &amp; AMAR@@ OK , a list with similar interpre@@ ters to the each case . note : you do not need any load @-@ fm profile to be able to use this feature . &quot;
&amp; AMAR@@ OK ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; eg ; Linux ) . further information can be found in the summary of the functions and gallery with screen photos .
&quot; AMAR@@ OK only need the package K@@ deli@@ bs , and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you must have installed K@@ deli@@ bs , because &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; we need some of them to compile e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a little guide on how to compile K@@ deli@@ bs . &quot;
&quot; some functions such as O@@ SD set the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ ktop@@ .org . thus , flu@@ x@@ box will work for example , but flu@@ x@@ box will work for example difficulties . we try to support AMAR@@ OK on all platforms , so we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because these represent an excellent development environment . &quot;
probably one of your files will make a mistake in the Tag@@ Li@@ b library . you can see the file in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / AMAR@@ OK / share / scan @-@ scan . after that you can delete the file and create the collection again .
&quot; mostly , it is that T@@ agli@@ b falls in reading the met@@ a @-@ info from this file . please report this error to the Day @-@ Li@@ b developers under bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; if you use MySQL as a database , please try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; AMAR@@ OK , is something mature . &quot;
&quot; make sure that all of &amp; AMAR@@ OK , compiled libraries with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; AMAR@@ OK , Tag@@ Li@@ b , but with GCC 3.@@ 3.@@ x compiled , then this leads to overthrow the met@@ a @-@ information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d , then de@@ activate automatic . off if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ drop by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens with a crash ) . if it is a common time crash , and you will send us a good back@@ wards , the error will be fixed . &quot;
this is because a lot of program data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 can write in the met@@ a @-@ info but not as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
&quot; # ! / usr / bin / per@@ l &quot; &quot; The file $ AR@@ G@@ V &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; errors in writing the tags from $ AR@@ G@@ V &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; &quot; &#91; MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ; &quot;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be installed using this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&quot; &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / re@@ petition / dynamic playlist ) see in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , the toolbar icons can be viewed in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . please note the status De@@ activ@@ ates on grey and semi @-@ transparent . note that one has to click on a symbol up to three times in some cases until this setting displays their effect . &quot;
if you get this error : amar@@ oc@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ pixels . please check if AMAR@@ OK the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos;@@ sam@@ amar@@ oc@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p Q@@ T .
&quot; to fix this error , you may need to remove any coll@@ ision Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that AMAR@@ OK the right version first . &quot;
there are some possibilities . most installation problems clarify themselves at the light@@ est by the help of a experts your uni@@ x@@ - or Linux distribution . you can also look for help with other users or the developers . use the forum and the IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in the channel # AMAR@@ OK .
&quot; Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please enter there only one mistake , if you &apos;re somewhat near a bug in AMAR@@ OK itself . &quot;
&quot; after the start of &amp; AMAR@@ OK , only a blank playlist appears . how do you come in music ? &quot;
this is easy . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
&quot; to keep the surface intui@@ tively , the start the window into the statistic window was converted . you will find it under extras . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the rating by the user , while the points are automatically comp@@ uted . &quot;
&quot; to evaluate pieces , the playlist must be displayed in the playlist and select column display . click anywhere in the new rating column to locate the rating for a piece . you can also use the short@@ cut Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background . &quot;
select the files you want to remove and then click on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select From a playlist remove from the pop@@ up menu .
&quot; drag a playlist file with your mouse into the playlist and drop them there , just as you would also make it with other files . &quot;
&quot; in the toolbar of the playlist , directly next to the add @-@ button , you can save the button playlist , click on it . &quot;
probably missing the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config . install the package x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel and install &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; new . see also after lib@@ visual , this package includes many very beautiful visu@@ alis@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; the E@@ quali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button of mouse ) . besides , you will find it via the menu bar under Extr@@ as E@@ quali@@ zer .... &quot;
&quot; no . yes , that is true ! no ! &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; therefore , the real question are Whi@@ ch media types supports G@@ stre@@ amer / X@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MA@@ S / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support pretty much every concei@@ vable audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even support text and PN@@ G ! &quot;
&quot; it can ! maybe use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which will be supplied in the pres@@ et@@ ting of no MP3 @-@ decoder . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , GG : Red@@ hat mp3 k@@ de , Invent@@ ory aste &quot;
run the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; plays MP3 &apos;s starting : - )
&quot; if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver using the Al@@ sa S@@ ink , the device must use a bl@@ ender . a bl@@ ender allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneous audio . this can be reached by a sound controller ( e.g. SB@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( software bl@@ ender ) . see the assistance D@@ mix for AL@@ SA . &quot;
the output of this command should help you search for the problem ache and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you might need to specify another S@@ ink ( such as os@@ s@@ day ) .
&quot; this does &amp; AMAR@@ OK , you don &apos;t forget that media you must first de@@ coded . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ coded and sends the PC@@ M @-@ data to AL@@ SA . exactly like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ coded the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can be exhibit@@ ing directly to AL@@ SA , just like X@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; either use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really magnificent ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open control center sound &amp; multimedia sound system . enable sound server with maximum possible priority ( real @-@ time listing ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ s@@ wr@@ ap@@ per su@@ id is set : &quot;
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ X there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ de@@ cs that can cause disturb@@ ing playback . read this error report . the magni@@ fication of the sound @-@ Pu@@ ff@@ ers in your AL@@ SA @-@ furnishing file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
&quot; either do not use the Arts driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or X@@ ine , or install K@@ DE @-@ Multimedia completely to get the fastest Arts co@@ de@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc . ) . &quot;
&quot; probably use the Arts driver . use a different driver ( the X@@ ine driver has been optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts st@@ ables in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the doll@@ s , the less slow respond to visu@@ alis@@ ations . yes , this is an error , please help us fix it . &quot;
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed but when I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , rus@@ hes &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; starting . why ? &quot;
&quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all components . run G@@ ST regi@@ sters to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components . &quot;
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if this does not help you can also ask the IR@@ C channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
try this ( stop AMAR@@ OK before ! ) : - Download fil@@ m@@ peg to compile and install it . then run the Module folder with G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run G@@ ST register again . start now &amp; AMAR@@ OK ;
&quot; please report that below bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. if you have a complete list of suggestions / wishes , please send them the best to our mail@@ ing list : AMAR@@ OK @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot;

&quot; this is a convenient method , recently opened projects again to load . the related sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry opens the project . &quot;
&quot; saves the current project . if the project has been stored already once , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise , after a new fil@@ ename . &quot;
saves the current project under a new fil@@ ename . K@@ DE &apos;s dialogue Save under is displayed with which you can choose folder and fil@@ ename for the project file .
saves all open projects . this is the same when you save for each individual project file .
&quot; includes the current project . if a project has changed and not yet been stored , asks &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what will happen . you can then choose between saving and changes . besides , you can then cancel the closing and keep the project so open . &quot;
&quot; includes all open projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is requested to ask for each in@@ stored project , what should happen with it , just as if you have saved for each project file . &quot;
&quot; includes all open projects and termin@@ ated &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each in@@ stored project is asked , what should happen with it , as if you have saved file . &quot;
&quot; if you call this entry , you can select through the upcoming dialogue files to add to the project . it has the same effect as if you choose the files directly from the top view into the project view , the attached files appear in the basic folder of the CD . &quot;
&quot; opens the dialogue &quot; burning &quot; for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the characteristics dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button burning Br@@ ing , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to burning the medium @-@ dialog can be opened only if the project already contains data . &quot;
opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make a lot of project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are described above what is that ? -@@ Help described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . &quot;
&quot; this entry can only be used on an active data @-@ CD / DVD or video project . it is useful when you use files for a multi @-@ session CD . this is useful for you , even if this function is not used for you , so that you can already see existing files and folders for you . &quot;
&quot; this entry appears to be removed with an active data @-@ CD / DVD or video project . this function does imp@@ ose &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; , imported files from the current project . this feature remo@@ ves no files from the medium , they bl@@ ends just the previously imported files . &quot;
&quot; opens the CD @-@ Copy Dialog . this also allows the copy of a CD to another medium . alternatively , you can also burn a picture from a CD in place , then you would like to burn if you want to copy CDs with def@@ ective sectors or video @-@ CDs . &quot;
&quot; opens the DVD copy @-@ copying dialog . this also allows the copying of a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also burn a picture of a DVD instead of normal copy , then the target medium must be big enough to absor@@ b the entire ( video ) data of the source medi@@ ums in the original form . &quot;
opens the dialog to delete a CD R@@ W . this allows you to delete the entire content or parts of a CD R@@ W .

&quot; bur@@ ns a previously linked DVD image . the dialog asks you to a * .@@ is@@ o file as a data source , which then can be burned down through handle of the burning button . &quot;
&quot; a previously used DVD video can be converted . this dialog window appears usually after reading a DVD in the ingre@@ dient , but can also be used even all@@ ot@@ ings . it contains information about the desired video , co @-@ settings and even ways to change the size and to cut black edges . &quot;
&quot; shows information about the covered medium . this information is displayed in the ingredients and contain properties of the medium , such as size and title length of CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; displays a list of the toolbar of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . when an entry is crossed , the toolbar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; if this is crossed , a small ly@@ re at the bottom of the window appears . it contains information on the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; refer to the folder view or out . the folder view contains an overview of your folder and the CD / DVD drives . if the content is enabled , the content is displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives , also have a context menu with functions such as media information , locks and un@@ locking of the hard@@ ship or expres@@ sions of the medium . &quot;
&quot; enables the ingre@@ dient of view or from . the ingredients enables the select and drop files into the project view . the ingredients is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , provided a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; the head@@ bar in the project view is one or out . the head@@ bar is a narrow area , which is only visible when the project view is open . the head@@ bar has no real function , it only looks pretty much and separates the project view clearly from the remaining views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialogue window to modify the keyboards for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; when one has chosen one of the available commands in the upper part , one can customize the key order for it further down . &quot;
&quot; this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; furniture assistant . with this , the correct per@@ missions to the bre@@ aches of CDs and DVDs are required . therefore , system administration files need to enter the password for system administration ( root ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here , general programs will be made . nearly all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should function on An@@ hi@@ eb . this dialog is intended to person@@ alize and to the fine tuning of the program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is how many others &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications also , with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; -@@ interface is equipped with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a sh@@ ell@@ script . &quot;
&quot; to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions to use , you can either use the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or the something more comfortable program of K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are essential in the functionality , therefore , is rather your taste and the type of your requirements will be crucial to what the relevant programmes give you . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter we take the command line d@@ co@@ p to use the command line d@@ co@@ p . to make use of the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P , you need to make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; then start something like the following at the console : &quot;
&quot; besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , which have all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program brick , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts that are described below . &quot;
&quot; the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface between &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ CD , format DVD and other functions for the witness of new projects . &quot;

&quot; as a result of such a creat@@ e@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , one can obtain a project about the command line : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) and then a reference to the project received by # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project . by using this reference it is possible to alter the project about K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface . &quot;
&quot; K@@ 3@@ b offers the above listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface , which is only applied to data projects ( CD and DVD ) : &quot;

&quot; for example , it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then adds files to the new folder : &quot;

&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ Re@@ ading for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it the simple audio CD is stored and stored in MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . also other formats are possible depending on the en@@ coder which is installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the user interface of cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for the reading of &amp; CD ; -@@ data in WAV files ( comp@@ ress ) . currently l@@ ame for MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs and FL@@ AC ( ver@@ lu@@ st@@ free comp@@ ression ) can still be installed from Linux distribution ) . more co @-@ di@@ ers can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) . &quot;
&quot; first , the titles of the &amp; CD ; read and stored in WAV files on the computer ( ver@@ lu@@ st@@ free and comp@@ ressed ) ; and then &quot;
in a second step these WAV files ( usually one per title ) comp@@ ressed into the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format or other formats such as the ver@@ lu@@ st@@ free FL@@ AC .
&quot; for the first step , the reading of the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost any distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must now be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other co@@ di@@ ers have already been installed , so it &apos;s most probably not necessary for any Linux distri@@ butions . however , there is only the codi@@ le packages installed . if for example FL@@ AC is not used , the installation is not required . &quot;
which en@@ coder / file format is supposed to be used ? the chapter World Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction on en@@ coder , audio quality and comp@@ ressing factors . &quot;
&quot; a word for copying of protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read the protection of audio data from the &amp; CD ; . this program is not provided by any copying audio CD . if not possible the mechanisms of copying protection , it is not possible to avoid the mechanisms of cop@@ ing protection . just avoid the acquisition of copy @-@ protected audio @-@ CD ; s ! &quot;
&quot; while the set @-@ up is done only once ( the furniture dialog can be called up to a suitable configuration ) , after the daily handling of a &amp; CD ; to the hard disk , this leads ( hopefully ) to the understanding of the sl@@ ender approach of the user interface , which you will be frequently st@@ acked at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; can convert into many formats - depending on which en@@ coder programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FL@@ AC &amp; etc . ) &quot;
&quot; can &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB on the Internet or can work completely without network , whereby all this is manually recorded . &quot;
&quot; this is just a brief list of the commands of the main window . on the side step by step , further information , such as this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tab@@ s for the configuration of the program . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ DB request of CD data according to the establishment of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be locally or online , in the latter case must first be made the connection to the Internet . ) &quot;
start reading and - if an en@@ coder has been configured in the tab settings in the tab toolbar - the coding .
&quot; opens a sub@@ menu with a list of available en@@ coder , so that selecting with another en@@ coder can be read as the default one . it is to be noted that previously the en@@ coder has been configured in the dialog box . &quot;
opens the file manager so that a file en@@ coded file will be selected instead of a full &amp; CD .
opens the furniture dialog to configure the type of notification ( such as prot@@ oc@@ ols , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for programs ( such as read the &amp; CD ; termin@@ ated ) . &quot;
opens the main landmark dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different card @-@ cards ( like en@@ coder , to set the en@@ co@@ ders ) . here you have to go before the program can be successfully used ! &quot;
this chapter describes sound quality , co@@ di@@ ers and comp@@ ression rates and helps you choose the right direction . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information should be lost , a ver@@ lu@@ st@@ free audio @-@ format is required . besides FL@@ AC there are also other as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; Mon@@ key &apos; , which may possibly be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the small comp@@ ression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can be recovered . &quot;
&quot; among the audio formats , the information generated by data comp@@ ress depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG might have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at low rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above these balls , the differences will produce less important because both co@@ di@@ ers are very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ not as &apos; free , l@@ ame is still provided with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license questions . &quot;
&quot; + high up to very high quality sound quality ( in high volumes , but compared with O@@ GG slightly deeper quality in deeper p@@ itr@@ ates . &quot;
O@@ GG - if only music belongs to a computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG .
&quot; MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special car stere@@ otyp@@ ical equipment . today - initially 2009 - support these devices mostly only the MP3 format . &quot;
a brief list of parameters for audio quality and turned out of it to &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pre@@ set standard &apos; = These attitude should normally offer transparency for most people and most of the music @-@ pieces acceptable , and has a very high quality . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stere@@ os@@ ing plants with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , Com@@ pres@@ sion rate up to 6.3 mm needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stere@@ os@@ ks with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pre@@ set extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , comp@@ ression rate approximately 5.5 . needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a song . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stere@@ os@@ ing with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR joint stereo , comp@@ ression rate approximately 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a song . good enough for music of young people , portable devices and car @-@ e@@ aters . but not good enough for better Hi@@ Fi stere@@ os@@ ing systems . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pre@@ set Ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting is exag@@ ger@@ ated for most people and most environments but if you definitely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; CD ; information , which is manually entered or obtained from the free@@ DB via the Internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can transfer / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the en@@ coding program to create the folder and file names and the characteristics of the music files . &quot;
&quot; in connection with code programs , there are often a combination of programs for the co @-@ erer and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the en@@ coding explain the switches for these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example , to add the &amp; CD ; title to the keywords ( English : tag ) if MP@@ 3@@ s must be coded with l@@ ame , the switch sel@@ d of l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; added . the result looks as follows : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button @-@ bar in the wizard ) :
&quot; that &apos;s what the free@@ DB is : a free database which can be downloaded and enter the audio CD , so that all other those information can be downloaded instead of yourself into the computer : &amp; CD ; title , artist , names of pieces &amp; etc . , not by the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I ( An@@ ke of the U@@ eber@@ ger ) is not a lawyer . however , the information is meant to be removed from the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so may not be added neither to the artist nor the music enterprise . all the information can be found with a b@@ umb@@ le@@ bee through a &amp; CD ; shop , physical or virtu@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is active a cross @-@ box address ( sending an address ) . in this type of configuration , it appears , the e @-@ mail address is not used when retri@@ ev@@ ing the data from the server ( This can only know the programmer who has reviewed the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are in many countries copies of the main database . if &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; used to use free@@ DB , the geographical server is needed . this saves band@@ width in the network and resem@@ bles the load between the machines . &quot;
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org returns an up @-@ to @-@ date list of mirror servers for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively you can download the complete database or ( normally created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which trigger program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
&quot; there are ru@@ m@@ ors that it is used to cd@@ ano@@ ano@@ ia ; who wants to know more accurately , search in source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD . see To be noted that the cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must be installed first to be installed if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; to the saving of the WAV files , the codi@@ le and thus the desired file format will be chosen . when the first opening there are pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FL@@ AC ( a ver@@ lu@@ st@@ free comp@@ ressing for audio data ) on the tab of the en@@ coder . other co@@ di@@ ers can be added at this tab . &quot;
the di@@ ver package must be installed from the corresponding Linux distribution . this is also required for the pre@@ defined co@@ di@@ ers . more information about Ko@@ di@@ ers can be found in the chapter Worldwide Co@@ di@@ ers .
&quot; after installing a co@@ di@@ er@@ ers you can receive further information on his switch , by entering a command such as l@@ ame - help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a con@@ sol@@ en@@ window ( eg ; console ) . in this way it must be replaced by the name of the installed co@@ di@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this can have many causes . check the setup of the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drives , the sp@@ elling and readers are installed on both cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia as well as the audio en@@ coder of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , FL@@ AC &amp; etc . ) . try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal . this could give an indication of what is wrong . &quot;
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the envelop@@ e of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , everything understood but are somehow still in@@ secure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example we will start the program for the first time , everything setup and our first &amp; CD ; read extreme &apos; to use MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable B@@ itr@@ ate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 keywords ( tags ) . &quot;
&quot; there must be cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre@@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . at least , it is not necessary to compile the source files that you can of course always do . &quot;
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is and that you have write down to ( eg ; by trying to copy with the Kon@@ quer@@ or something to copy ) .
&quot; the first section covers the basic approach of &amp; Co @-@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , something which probably is done only once and &quot;
&quot; the second section describes the procedure for reading a &amp; CD ; , which must be repeated for each out@@ going &amp; CD . &quot;
here we determine the un@@ folding co@@ di@@ ers for comp@@ ression of music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pre@@ set extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) and which structure is used to use the free@@ DB to use the free@@ DB to download the &amp; CD ; data from the Internet .
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change with each reading a &amp; CD ; change when once the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the device name will be passed on to the re@@ adable program to read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces can be read .
&quot; frequently , / dev / c@@ drom is a symbo@@ lic link to the real device name of your drive . if this is not working or if more than a &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , it can also help the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device records for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
&quot; the card map General settings . here there &apos;s not much to be done . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything will be shown as ad@@ mitt@@ edly as shown in the screenshot . &quot;
&quot; only when un@@ complete information can be requested , so that you will be informed if information about the witnesses of keywords ( tags ) are missing . &quot;
the card card CD ; -@@ Settings . just choose both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a free@@ DB machine .
note : the machine must be connected during the reading of the &amp; CD ; with the Internet he can access the free@@ DB server .
&quot; the second selection is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry is found immediately , if you are dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and entry name / fil@@ ename or day entries , they can be easily changed . the directory entry or fil@@ ename is changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or@@ - &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID@@ 3 @-@ tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example , it is further to note : if you want to manually enter the selection fields and free@@ DB . however , these over 620 MB is not used . however , this is about 620 MB big , think that the two choices will be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following card card . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is for us free@@ DB . these are settings for the data @-@ inquiry , for retri@@ eve the &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB server via the Internet . how does the system , which data will get the CD ? read the section on free@@ DB . &quot;
mode : we have not downloaded the database and we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to page fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look after a mirror server nearby . on this way the load is distributed between the machines . this setting will be as the first attempt to work .
&quot; both function equivalent to the server , since many fire@@ walls record 88@@ 80 standard , there is perhaps more luck with the protocol 80 , since the &amp; HTTP ; protocol is usually open to surf the internet . &quot;
in this example we do not want to transfer any &amp; CD ; data to the free@@ DB server .
simply take the settings of the screenshot ( make sure that the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
&quot; at the same time , dec@@ ayed pieces : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time when using only an existing drive ? parall@@ el@@ es Read and en@@ coding ? the author doesn &apos;t know it , therefore just try himself . &quot;
&quot; CD ; after reading the last piece , check this to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the trial . &quot;
&quot; custom folder for temporary files : if you can cross this folder , then the folder can be stored in which the WAV files are stored , the files in the private folder you don &apos;t forget that if you want to do something with the WAV files . &quot;
&quot; everything you enter as it is on the screenshot is a bit long , under circumstances a bit must be broken down to the right to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned earlier , this is an attitude for very good audio @-@ quality , even for very good Hi@@ Fi stere@@ os@@ . the resulting rate factor is 6.3 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the comp@@ ression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and storage . &quot;
&quot; note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the restriction on the production of tags in version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1 &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags can also be deleted , in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) . &quot;
Set the rest as in the screenshot . some comments for future use is outside of this example :
&quot; number of simultaneously to codi@@ le WAV files : with Dual@@ Core or Quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried , more than a WAV file at the same time . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s it , we have just finished the basic facility of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; this configuration is used as default for each reading a &amp; CD ; used . if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change it again . &quot;
&quot; in this section is described how the process of re@@ ada@@ ches of the &amp; CD is structured , which is structured in the previous section as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the free@@ DB will pick up , has to be described in the previous section . the process of which is described in this section , has to be repeated for each one @-@ out &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; since we are a &amp; CD ; use which is not included in free@@ DB , see the screen photos completely different from the one &amp; CD ; with successful by free@@ DB cut data . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually to submit them from the Internet . comments will be applied to the differences . &quot;
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this hand@@ book .
&quot; if this is not yet to happen , you have to go now the &amp; CD ; in the main window , which was defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment the pieces and length should be listed in the window , just as in the screenshot of the photo . this only if the &amp; CD was identified ; as audio CD was identified ; and that cd@@ ano@@ ano@@ ia could be read . &quot;
if this does not happen then you are searching for questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section on basic settings .
&quot; attention : if the &amp; CD was picked up successfully by the free@@ DB , all titles of the pieces are already filled out and also the name of the artist and the album are shown . &quot;
&quot; in the event that there is more than an entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; -@@ key to your &amp; CD ; there will be a window built , and you can select the database entry , which you think is best to your &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; if you do not have the anchor box for the automatic query of free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; -@@ settings in dialog for the settings ) , you can also manually trigger you by selecting the first button in the toolbar . if you don &apos;t have local database , you need the connection to the Internet . &quot;
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen photo . the title of the piece in the first line of the input label &apos; The rest of the data in the input field &apos; album &apos; .
&quot; the artist must not be given more in the input field of &quot; &quot; Current Tit@@ le &quot; &quot; unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece . &quot;
&quot; the lower comment field can be used for the individual comments ini@@ di@@ aries each piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments that are common to all the pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the free@@ DB is the CD editor not empty , but it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor , so that you may not only begin with the artist and album names ( e.g. if all words are beginning with big letters , or not ... ) , but also to consider whether there are any unwanted remarks . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limited the length of the fields on 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the commentary . if you are ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 @-@ tags , you have un@@ restricted field settings , at least to what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; max . this option is set up on the tab . &quot;
&quot; you can change the day information of the generated files later anytime with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags . &quot;
tags are not supported by all co @-@ agents or file formats . see the help of the di@@ vers to get more information .
&quot; simply choose an entry , which is obvious with the style of the exten@@ sively . in this example , this is not important as we do not transfer the &amp; CD . for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or rap for example are to be found under Rock . &quot;
&quot; after choosing &apos; OK &apos; , you come back to the main window . click on the line with the second piece . &quot;
the window of the CD editor will be back and you will see that the boxes for the album are already filled with the entered data that we &apos;ve collected for the first piece . enter the title of the piece in any case and other information that you wish .
click the next row in the main window and enter the same way until you have all the cover data of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window will not appear if you have downloaded the data from the free@@ DB . it is already sorted into one of these categories of database .
it is the third button of the toolbar . note that the artist and the album will be displayed on the piece list .
&quot; note that it has a check @-@ signs before each line of a piece . only the title that are marked as one piece . make sure that all pieces are selected , or bed the button all pieces select at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at one time . &quot;
&quot; started by clicking on the button selection out of the re@@ viewing process , this window appears to be confirmed . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with orders and follow what is going . &quot;
&quot; click on the tab orders to turn on the order window . it is in the upper upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the toolbar . &quot;
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is currently being read on the hard disk . the status of the program is shown in the lower part of the window in the status line .
&quot; this error messages can be seen if you &apos;re trying to work with a di@@ vers , which you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successful with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list . &quot;
by the way , the folder for the tmp file and the target folder are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked if you have access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - ) &quot;
&quot; now it is clear , why the error occurred directly after the end of the first piece of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; the order 1 reads the first piece , he is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the coding of pieces 1 to the format MP3 . therefore , read and coding parallel . note the status quo in the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
&quot; the author of the programme has not found any configuration settings to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing is configur@@ able , the number of parallel processes to read and coding . at powerful machines the result is un@@ clear . the used machine with a AM@@ D@@ 64 does not seem to have a problem during the simultaneous display and en@@ coding ( of however , two different g@@ aps ) . &quot;
&quot; now the last title is read , while another piece is coded and a third order is coded in the queu@@ e of the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers . after the last piece is coded , a small window will enter a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x. or 4.@@ x and cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create comp@@ ressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the en@@ coder of your choice . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is maintained today within the &amp; k@@ de ; CV@@ S , as part of the c@@ ulti@@ media package , however , you can download an anonymous copy . most distri@@ butions contain already a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package is . install the par@@ c@@ ulti@@ media from your distribution . if you read this , you probably have done it ... &quot;
this section is directed to persons who compile the source files and not intended for users to use a pre @-@ compiled package of your distribution .
&quot; if you are looking for help you can search for your needs when the program runs your needs when it is running , then the following is true for you : &quot;
&quot; a program which calls for many different other programs , has many variations of settings . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen photos of the various card maps of settings and also contains comments for options that may not be used in the example . &quot;
&quot; hello , still on reading ? even if only the help menu was to click on the first @-@ time stamp of the program , it should proceed from this kind of empty screen ( especially if at the time of the program , no audio CD ; on the drive ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu off ? &quot;
what is about ? who reads this has probably already started the program . it should look something like this :
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author can not maintain this hand@@ book . it is as the first version for a hand@@ book to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; intended to do it . at least after cont@@ acting with the author . and if you read this , he has given this section and therefore agree with this proposal . &quot;
&quot; strange when it has succeeded in getting the source file from the &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you do not need these information , but ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ s of &amp; k@@ de ; . besides others he has no properties with real @-@ time graf@@ ik and kar@@ a@@ oke @-@ real @-@ way of texts , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have . &quot;
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system ; it should also work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ o@@ und Project Driver , which is needed for CIS cards . AL@@ SA is supported as soon as it supports a sequence . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it is easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphic representation of the activity of any MIDI channel through sl@@ ate the pressed buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
Dr@@ ag &amp; Drop so that you can drag in &amp; k@@ de ; every MIDI file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window to draw on the top .
supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( cou@@ ps or textile products ) . C@@ Mid selected automatically the respectively used procedure .
seat support . if you finish &amp; k@@ de ; during the release of a song end the Mid @-@ Mid start again with the same song again .
&quot; supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and CIS cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can select opening ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog with which you can choose the desired song . &quot;
you can also drop a file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window will drop . this also works with multiple songs simultaneously .
&quot; to pick a piece of music , open it and bed the button to play in the toolbar , select the entry from the menu item or insert the lease . &quot;
&quot; please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece automatically starts , once you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid @-@ window . ( with several pieces , they will be added to a collection and then played down@@ side . ) &quot;
&quot; once &amp; k@@ mid ; a play happens , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive with the controller . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows left and right of the temp@@ o . to get back the original speed , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the le@@ ert@@ aste has two tasks : when a play is played , a pressure on the paste break or the menu &apos; break in the menu item , so interru@@ pt the playback . be@@ ware the lease while no play will start , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; the playback . &quot;
lyrics can be stored on two species in a piece of piece . some pieces are using Tex@@ ter@@ eig@@ nis and another both . some pieces do not have any text : - )
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can adjust which events are supposed to be displayed and even better : the event is used , so that you cannot manually adjust the associated entry to the entry Automatic Tex@@ el text . however , you still have the possibility to change this when you want to see the other kind . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set up an event in an event , select from the Settings menu settings and son@@ ic events . the same function also have the buttons 1 and 2 . &quot;
&quot; a collection is a list of MIDI files , which you summar@@ ize it . these will be played in line . in this section you will be able to use the collections effectively . &quot;
&quot; to open a collection , open first the collection points . you will find here in the menu collection under the point Organ@@ ize .... Click there on New and enter the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy a existing collection by clicking on copying and then select the name for the new collection . this collection will include the same songs as the original one .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can adjust the settings in the collection panel . &quot;
&quot; in the temporary collection , all the songs you want to add to any other collection . &quot;
&quot; when using the application , this collection is not saved . concerns that if you add many pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , they have to be selected in the collection camp . there you can add a song with the button Add . it appears in turn the file dialog , with whose help you can choose the desired song . &quot;
&quot; a second method to add a song depends on the setting of automatic transmis@@ sions to the collection . &quot;
&quot; when automatic adding to the collection is activated , a piece of opening ( using file Open or Dr@@ ag &amp; Drop ) automatically added to the active collection . &quot;
&quot; when automatic adding to the collection is not enabled , when opening a piece , the temporary collection is activated and managed . this collection will then be added to the opening pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection camp , select the collection and the desired song and then click on removing . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the sequence according to the sub@@ menu of the menu Coll@@ ections , the songs are played in order as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; when you add songs or remove or remove any order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined . &quot;
&quot; to send a song , select it in the collection camp , or use the selection list above the kar@@ a@@ oke text . &quot;
&quot; to jump to a song , select the button next song , the entry next song from the menu item or press the arrow right . &quot;
&quot; to jump the reverse with a song , select the button of previous piece , the entry of previous piece of the menu or press the arrow button left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection camp , select the seen collection and click on the button Delete . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not play a role as it is not saved while leaving &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thesizer , which are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case the MIDI @-@ map General @-@ MIDI @-@ MIDI events are interpreted in events that understands the syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
&quot; for example you can create a MIDI map , which conver@@ ts all the events of the type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the Typ@@ s Change patch to Tru@@ mp@@ et and thus always a trumpet sound when originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you only have a sound card , you do not need MIDI map , because all sound@@ cards are GM -@@ compatible ( incl . AW@@ E - and CIS cards , FM -@@ devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps . you need to edit the appropriate file from hand ( with your favorite dit@@ or ) . &quot;
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text @-@ file which stores all required re@@ alizations for the play of a piece .
&quot; each section may only appear once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section , which may appear as often as desired . however , that every appearance has a different text ID ( see below ) . &quot;
De@@ fine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; A further key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D De@@ fine CH@@ ANN@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D Options ... EN@@ D
&quot; you see that De@@ fine is needed to display that a section begins ( except for Options ) and EN@@ D that reached the end of an interface . &quot;
&quot; please send me your map file as e @-@ mail , so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can provide for devices that are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible . &quot;
&quot; in this section , the patches of General MIDI will be shown on your specific keyboard . general use looks like this : &quot;
&quot; please note that the left side of the Equ@@ al sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM Pat@@ ches are in the right order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and also no line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional All Key@@ s@@ To M is needed to put all tones with the number M . if your keyboard is not supported ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , the same as a gun powder . for this you wear the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P Section : &quot;
&quot; if now a MIDI file should play a touch with patch 127 ( gun shot ) , it takes Patch 100 ( the Drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of which sound is available in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here with the term Drum patch of the patch is meant , with which every sound is a different per@@ si@@ sion@@ ing instrument ( Drum , basin , Marac@@ as &amp; etc . ) and not the one that means the sound height of the always same drum ( like it has some Key@@ boards ) . &quot;
the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is needed to specify as t@@ ints on a specific channel or instrument . the use is :
&quot; as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section , the order of lines is very important , so their availability . you must therefore create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define several m@@ ym@@ aps for each channel and every instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
&quot; Ke@@ ym@@ caps are used mainly to train t@@ ints on the Per@@ k@@ ussion canal . take a look at the details supplied by Ke@@ ym@@ aps . &quot;
&quot; this section can be used to map some channels to others . if you want to exchange for example the first and second channel , you can easily get in CH@@ ANN@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for keyboards , which have percussion for a specific channel ( general MIDI to channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; Midi @-@ Devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ ANN@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section therefore has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following patterns : &quot;
&quot; N is the channel that is pic@@ tured on the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the Key@@ map must be re@@ defined in the file ! if you use the Key@@ boards patch option , all events are ignored that will change the patch in this channel . in this case the patch will then be used . &quot;
the For@@ ce@@ patch option can be useful for example to always use the Per@@ k@@ iller patch in the Per@@ k@@ ussion channel .
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ ratio gives in which relation of Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der event will be multiplied . if a MIDI file sends a pitch , this with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then only passed on . the value 40@@ 96 is used , so that in the Map file no dec@@ imal . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed , because GM there is a keyboard , which is a Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value 40@@ 96 to play a sound higher . unfortunately , but try some key@@ boards to play two t@@ ints up to an oc@@ tave higher . to try the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI map , simply open the dialog box Settings . you will find in the menu under settings , point MIDI settings &quot;
the channel view is a window with a whole series of pi@@ vi@@ keyboards ( one for every MIDI channel ) . on these keyboards you see which sounds are being played straight .
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can choose an instrument , the button is not more green but red to indicate that no longer is the original tool . &quot;
the channel view has ( up to now ) two different views to view the sponsored t@@ ints . view in the menu settings below the point channel view : settings
&quot; the pace @-@ LCD displays the speed , with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the pace of a song . so if you find , a song be too fast to follow the text you can slow@@ down it . to change the pace , use the arrows left and right of the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a piece of music has to be played . it contains the notes , the speed , the speed , &amp; etc . . this can lead the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways . &quot;
&quot; good , I can never force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 file you receive a similar sound quality . with a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc . you have control of everything . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; have happened because &amp; k@@ mid ; without EE@@ E support . to eliminate the problem you need to download a source distribution and install ( for example by k@@ mid ; &apos;s start ) &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I do not want to add any files separately . &quot;
&quot; agree that supports &amp; k@@ mid ; Dr@@ ag &amp; Drop . open just the folder you want to add in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or , select all files and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window . &quot;
activate previously necessarily the setting of automatic transmis@@ sions to the collection . otherwise the files for the temporary collection are added .
you can click the arrow key left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD panel to slow@@ down the playback . to restore the standard temp@@ o you can click on the LCD double click .
&quot; I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; working space a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; in this way I have to play a MIDI file ( when I want to play a kar@@ a@@ oke file ) or I want to play a file , just enter into the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window and drag the file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; if you only want to listen to a file without having to add them immediately to a collection , turn the setting of automatic Ad@@ ding to the collection , and the new ; file will add to the temporary collection &quot;
&quot; let us take you , you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ d. addition , you just want to play the first file . so put your temporary collection now contains exactly these a MIDI file . &quot;
then discover B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid to pick up and create a collection with all three files . how do you make that ?
these people sent me MIDI files or post @-@ cards . all heart@@ felt thanks ! if I hear these songs or the postcard see me anim@@ ate myself to program &amp; k@@ mid .
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; I &apos;m in the third year , so I &apos;m not much free time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take a bit of time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take a bit of time . as hob@@ bies I collect , MIDI files collect , music and prove things . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where they can download MIDI / kar@@ a@@ oke files , or even if you want to make a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you want to make me feel happy , write an e @-@ mail : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es &quot;
&quot; you really make me a huge pleasure , if you send me a postcard from your home or a MI@@ DI@@ - / Kar@@ a@@ oke file from a local group . if you want to send me a postcard or a MIDI file , you should contact me if I already have the file . &quot;
&quot; I have &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and by anyone wanting to settle for money . I want therefore empha@@ size that I only agree on the software , because / if I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or e @-@ mails ) . &quot;
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. B@@ ühler - Beh@@ avi@@ our of the feu@@ d that was the Ton@@ k at AW@@ E cards too high .

and of course my thanks also applies to all these outstanding musicians on the net that give us this wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ a@@ oke files .
&quot; in addition to this you can find &amp; k@@ mid ; also on his homepage , you can see the evolution below : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .html . you can also find links to pages with further kar@@ a@@ oke songs , &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , since the sound quality depends much of your sound card . it is not the same if you use a FM @-@ device or a AW@@ E card . &quot;
&quot; if you do not have any sound card , you must compile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DEM@@ O _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you would like a sound card , except that you can course hear no music . &quot;
&quot; if problems occur , please contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mail@@ ing lists or send an error message directly to me . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ players ; is an easy interface for M@@ Player , Ph@@ ono and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is needed to play video files from the M@@ Player or PH@@ ON@@ ON supported formats , as well as to play DVD , V@@ CD s or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet over as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
&quot; for additional help , please check the page The K@@ DE website on new releases , or to send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; user mail@@ ing list . &quot;
&quot; the application window is made of so @-@ called no@@ di@@ ble windows . there is always the window with the central view . either there is the window with the playlist . and finally there is a information window , which is only shown if there is information in it . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to send the preferred connections under the menu book@@ marks , but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries , which are to be played by each other , so you should use the category permanent playlist . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional Hier@@ archi@@ u@@ fe . if you add an entry , his group and all its sub@@ groups copies to the current category and the reproduction starts with the attached entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and permanent playlist can also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do it if &amp; km@@ player . you can simply select the different files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps . by using the click of a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this part is displayed . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , the menu has to be selected from the menu with playlist and choose either the editing mode or a different category . &quot;
&quot; all changes will be lost when the editing mode leave , or another group will be selected without the playlist . &quot;
&quot; as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; km@@ player , some functions can only be switched by changing the XML configuration files . &quot;
&quot; the animation of the start@@ up and be@@ aming can be de@@ activated by the em@@ ing of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ ra@@ c and change from &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ iger option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be inserted easily . &quot;
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; km@@ player ; will be the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / km@@ player / share / apps / km@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format does need to be supported XML file .
&quot; the animation of the program does not need to be short , it will automatically stop through the opening of another source . this would be disturb@@ ing at the end @-@ animation , however , the user can stop the application a second time . &quot;
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the ads of a favorite photo : &amp; lt ; body@@ work ; &amp; lt ; g = &quot; in@@ verse &quot; sr@@ c = &quot; file : / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gif ; &amp; lt ; / ; in the directory tests / some examples of S@@ MIL which will be supported by &amp; km@@ player ;
&quot; there is a rider to configure M@@ Player in the configuration dialog by &amp; km@@ player ; . here , the path from the player and the intermediate memory can be adjusted from the network and other things . &quot;
another tool for troub@@ les@@ hooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the toolbar . here is the output of M@@ Player is visible .
there is no rider for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog by &amp; km@@ player ; . everything must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ ra@@ c . here is an example of a &apos;@@ flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa is played :
&apos; Flash &apos; can be played within a km@@ player ; it can be inserted even the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
so that the &amp; km@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages can be re@@ activated , the &amp; km@@ player ; module can be specified as a service provider for the M@@ IME type . / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the dialog dialog by K@@ DE . &quot;
&quot; the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; km@@ player ; is available in a con@@ soles application and browse error regarding loading the browser module library . if there is no errors to occur , the back@@ end output inside &amp; km@@ player ; ( view , console , or console available from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a pre @-@ given back@@ end for a specific M@@ IME type is taken ( of course only if this was also determined ) , this must be done by manual change of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ ra@@ c . for example , PH@@ ON@@ ON will be repeated all og@@ g files : &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ players ; can play from TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be configured , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be manually edited . &quot;

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for creating graphical user surfaces and network support and is needed for the compile of &amp; k@@ ile ;
lat@@ ex ; : a professional let@@ ter@@ ing application . under Unix @-@ like systems will probably be trac@@ ed to the package &amp; lyrics ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution . for installation should be applied to the documentation of distribution or installation CD ; / DVD .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for various distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are on the k@@ ile ; website included .
&quot; this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experiences with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; &quot;
&quot; advanced users must hardly read this hand@@ book . however , the support to this project or its documentation should be requested to get the contact over the k@@ ile ; website . &quot;
&quot; questions about or the compile of &amp; k@@ ile ; on or are extensions desired , this should be addressed on the mail@@ ing list k@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; working surface . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ functions in a graphic interface and within these one simple , direct and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ functions in a graphical interface , as well as conversion tools for this . &quot; finally , the easy @-@ to @-@ use wizard , the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ Reference and the powerful project management . &quot;
to learn more about &amp; K@@ ate ; and its possibilities should learn the manual to K@@ ate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can start there directly with reading the chapters working with the Editor of &amp; K@@ ate ; Start .
&quot; for &amp; Lat@@ ex ; is the right places : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . W@@ Ã ¤ r@@ é@@ g@@ ent &amp; tex ; difficult to use , can also use a La@@ ie ( engl@@ . lay ) &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ Mak@@ ros is that it origin@@ ates from the sur@@ names of Les@@ lie La m@@ port . &quot;

&quot; just as other signat@@ ories contains &amp; Lat@@ ex ; an introduction , with which the most gener@@ ic properties like paper format , page numbered und Text@@ gr@@ Ã per begins with the command \ \ service } , and must be closed with the command \ \ end { document } again . &quot;
the quick @-@ entry assistant of &amp; k@@ ile ; is a simple function for the fast creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; the selection of the wizard ( menu ) provides some possibilities for the creation of the document . you can also place some of the settings related to the document .
&quot; documentation : hereby the type of the document works : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; book &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , Articles &#91; DIN ) &#91; source @-@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , Proj@@ ector &#91; Be@@ amer &#93; , Fo@@ ils &#91; pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; , Fo@@ ils &#91; pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or Custom . &quot;
en@@ coding : hereby the char@@ en@@ coding of the system is employed . modern systems used to use the character en@@ coding of the system . modern systems are increasingly using the UT@@ F @-@ 8 series as standard . best if UT@@ F @-@ 8x should be applied ( for correct processing of the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Documents ) .
this list contains the most widely used add @-@ packages for units and lat@@ ex ; for integration of m@@ Ã ¼ n@@ sen they are only rolled out in the case of cross @-@ section .
&quot; article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , Cover ( DIN ) , Cover ( DIN ) : the documentary classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN @-@ Reg@@ ulations ) . you should always find the application in creating German texts . &quot;
new users now don &apos;t worry about it . it is just a brief description of the functions and further information .
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; offers - just as other source code editors - the her@@ al@@ lig@@ ation of the used commands , attitudes and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . however , a simple problem search is not closed . however , it is getting noticed by the modest appearance of the output file . however , it is saved to you by the modest appearance of time and time . &quot;
with automatic re@@ sign@@ age of the environments is generated by entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ Beg@@ in { command } ) of &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically creates a blank ( to enter the text ) and the left mouse button ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be disabled in men@@ ue ; establish ... La@@ Te@@ X commands .
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; Lat@@ ex ; erm@@ ination the sub@@ division of the document into the following items ( part is the most important element ) :
&quot; in view of the document in the structure , you can view and viewed the individual elements by a mouse click . &quot;
when creating your own &amp; Lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful . once a DVI ; -@@ file ( engl . D e V ice I n@@ produced File ) &#93; was created ; jump &amp; k@@ ile ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ Viewer to the appropriate line in the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ source text .
&quot; a DVI ; file treats a description of the format document and also other information like the writer and is besides PDF the open output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; Lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools for viewing , conversion and printing of DVI ; -@@ files for various systems and systems . &quot;
&quot; when using the R@@ Ã ¼ ck @-@ search engines , the elements of DVI ; -@@ file has been cli@@ cked and once on an element in the DVI ; file extension is then cli@@ cked . once on a section in the &quot; &quot; Lat@@ ex ; source text &quot; , &quot; the corresponding position is cli@@ cked in the DVI ; -@@ source text , becomes the appropriate place in the DVI ; -@@ Viewer . &quot;
Master @-@ Document : this function is used in working with multiple files . with a master document the work with other integrated .@@ tex files will be simplified . when using a project a project @-@ wide master document can be set to project settings .
quick @-@ mounting : the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if no errors are present in the source code ) .
&quot; monitoring : in this mode , the DVI ; -@@ file on &quot; &quot; n@@ der@@ ver@@ â &quot; &quot; and there is no call by &amp; oc@@ ular ; according to the quick@@ set . &quot;
&quot; in taking into consideration of the works of the toolbar , the three large number of large parts should be developed into the document . the first selection of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... The ver@@ g@@ able &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands for the sub@@ division are : &quot;
&quot; the selection of other is related to articles such as Е@@ т@@ и@@ к@@ е@@ т@@ и : how keywords , fu@@ cking notes or references are available : &quot;
&quot; name : with this command a name is created for one section , an image or different element . &quot;
cover : is used for reference to a fixed name ( selection of choice ) .
when using quote there will be a selection list with liter@@ ary entries . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; it only works if the file is necessary to a project . for the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; -@@ files can be made natural also in &amp; k@@ ile ; from hand .
&quot; the last drop @-@ panel with the name of Gr@@ Ã ¶ s will be used for the definition of scri@@ ptures , reference to the main text , the fu@@ cking sheet etc . , there are the following scri@@ ptures : &quot;
&quot; in the call of &amp; k@@ ile , two choices : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and restri@@ cting the settings . 2 . the document can be written by the hand . &quot;
&quot; the brack@@ ets according to the command \ \ Docum@@ ent@@ class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; sets the fonts . if the scri@@ ptures shall not be set at the beginning , this can also be more likely in the text . &quot;
as soon as the above @-@ code example has to be entered into the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code will be compiled . the easi@@ est way to this is the use of men@@ ue B@@ auen or the Kn@@ op@@ fs fast construction .
the sourc@@ ec@@ ode must be saved in front of the compile . &amp; k@@ ile ; for storage automatically .
&quot; again the comp@@ iling of the document fails , should be sought after errors after errors . when using fast @-@ building &amp; oc@@ ular ; it is not the case , it should also be observed . &quot;
&quot; an environment ( engl@@ . environment ) is a text , which is treated differently than the remaining document . for example , a report with the correspondence chess is created , and only a few sin@@ ks should have a different f@@ ont . &quot;
the deposits are only within the area ( of \ \ Beg@@ in { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no damage .
&quot; there are many possibilities to asser@@ t the re@@ ada@@ bility and usability of the document . it enables you to add certain fonts , li@@ ant pressure , cur@@ ves , etc . these commands may end either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ Beg@@ in { emp@@ h } : this command is for the cur@@ ves and is long as long until he is closed with a \ \ end { ou@@ h } or another area is closed . a single word in a phr@@ ase can be represented with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quote : created a quote in the document . the quote begins with \ \ Beg@@ in { rate } and ends with \ \ end { rating } .
&quot; after the background to write the source code with the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ sign @-@ language , follows now a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for the creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; &quot;
&quot; once in the wizard a bit has been entered a bit text , a few adjustments should be taken for the better re@@ ada@@ bility of the document . we should consider a quote , a few places in the fat and cur@@ ves and a poem to the application to see the differences of these commands . &quot;
&quot; once the document was viewed , using editor view or Str@@ g E back to the editor back to the editor ) . with an external viewer , the window must be closed . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI ; file has been created , the document can be printed or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . &quot;
DVI ; is a more independent file format ( engl . D e V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for re@@ ada@@ bility of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF -@@ conver@@ ters or computer sciences . &quot;
&quot; for the printing of a &amp; DVI ; file are the same steps as for the creation of the document ( see ) . during the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - then the document can be printed correctly ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer can be properly configured ) . &quot;
&quot; the toolbar allows the conversion of DVI ; -@@ file into other formats . as soon as the DVI ; file from the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; source text was created , the transformation is able to start into over other formats using the buttons . &quot;
the pre @-@ contract search is the direct jump from the editor to the left @-@ to @-@ track position inside the DVI ; file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ Bin@@ Ã ¤ r@@ files . this must only create Modern under Settings K@@ ile ... Tools B@@ auen .
&quot; to customize the cursor position , the mouse @-@ cursor position must be re @-@ positioned in a line of source texts , and subsequently be cli@@ cked on board search . the jump to the corresponding place in the DVI ; -@@ Viewer now takes place . &quot;
with this function in &amp; oc@@ ular ; it is set up with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the appropriate &amp; Lat@@ ex ; document of &amp; k@@ ile ; used to create &amp; k@@ ile ; in &amp; oc@@ ular ; as text editor ( Settings oc@@ ular create ... Editor )
&quot; should not use quick@@ set of the &amp; DVI ; -@@ Viewer can not contain any error . should be a mistake , this is summar@@ ized in the log file or in the news window . &quot;
&quot; the log file is the fault of the fault file in the source text . in the editor you will see the buttons to be cli@@ cked between errors . the log file will then be cli@@ cked to see the faul@@ ty line , must be cli@@ cked on the error in the log Files and &amp; k@@ ile ; jumps to faul@@ ty line . &quot;
&quot; once on the corresponding button will be cli@@ cked into the toolbar , a window indicates the selection of the articles from the template for the document . the pre@@ set facilities are presented : &quot;
&quot; in selecting an empty document , a document can be used either from scratch or the wizard for quick creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; hop@@ eless users of &amp; Lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates into &amp; k@@ ile ; created , stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex , must be created either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; can create a new template using a current document and selection of file template from the document . &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document from a template using File , some char@@ gers are replaced by other data ( such as name or character en@@ coding ) . these variables can be set in attitudes K@@ ile ... Settings can be set in general . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings from which variables are to be replaced : &quot;
$ $ DO@@ UR ENT@@ CLASS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ : this string is used by entering document class . typically they are used as follows : \ \ Docum@@ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ C@@ ENT@@ CLASS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { item } .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to create a template is the usage of the assist@@ ants and that with the ordin@@ ates of the commands in the editor . once the document was created in this way :
&quot; when creating a new document , your own template can be used instead of by default . &quot;
&quot; a template can be created from any and lat@@ ex files . if a simple way to create a template , it should be sought after one in the Internet and described the steps described below . &quot;
&amp; k@@ ile ; used &amp; K@@ ate ; as internal editor . &amp; K@@ ate ; is a text editor for programmers with the perf@@ ecting of reading and Her@@ vor@@ tex ; ) . lots of settings for &amp; K@@ ate ; you can place on menu directly from &amp; k@@ ile ; out of course .
to learn more about K@@ ate &amp; K@@ ate ; and its possibilities should be carried out the manual to K@@ ate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; you can place there directly with reading the chapters working with the Editor of &amp; K@@ ate ;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ command , which can be called the men@@ Ã ¼ using La@@ Te@@ X Reference Manual . you can find a detailed description of nearly all orders which can be found in &amp; Lat@@ ex ; use , as well as their syntax . &quot;
&quot; a double @-@ click with a dr@@ unk string , to select the &amp; tex ; -@@ word to select \ \ par of \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p only \ \ par excellence . &quot;
&quot; in the turn of the text with the left mouse button , the text @-@ shaped text will automatically be copied into the clip@@ board . &quot;
when using the arrow buttons with a dr@@ unk reverse side you can choose parts of the source code in the editor window .
&amp; k@@ ile ; has the ability to browse the most different types of source texts and highlight this her@@ ent . for example , the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands from normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ulas are highlighted by another color . &quot;
&quot; a lot of assist@@ ants can be found via their own kind of book@@ marks within the text . the men@@ Ã ¼ Ã ¤ r@@ ens or the respective keyboard short@@ cut down the jump to n@@ Ã ¤ re or final jumping stamp . thereby , this spring@@ time is highlighted , so that it is automatically deleted during the first input of a character . &quot;
&quot; the Edit is probably one of the main aspects associated with the use of a program such as &amp; k@@ ile ; . although &amp; K@@ ate ; already excellent possibilities , were added in &amp; k@@ ile ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; source tex@@ tured ; special commands for their selection . &quot;
&quot; choose a complete paragraph ( group of lines , contained on both sides a blank lines ) . with a paragraph does not include a text with all other rows ( such as in other text editors ) . the only bow item in &amp; k@@ ile ; is that the only bow weight is separated by two blank lines . &quot;
&quot; choose the word under the current cursor position . this selection also has an extended meaning , since this command also &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands with a rich star ( * ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end . &quot;
&quot; for example , a part of the document can be removed completely at this first and by drag the button de@@ f . &amp; K@@ ate ; provides the keyboard short@@ cut here . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers its own command here for a faster result . under Be@@ verage Rem@@ ove are the following commands to use the text : &quot;
remo@@ ves a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; k@@ ile ; is included in the description to Edit@@ ing paragraph .
&quot; it has already become clear@@ er that environments will play a central role in &amp; Lat@@ ex ; therefore , it offers &amp; k@@ ile ; for further orders under the working environment for a real working with &amp; Lat@@ ex ; &quot;
with this command there will be re@@ connecting to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to the back@@ side of the area .
with this command there will be re@@ connecting to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to the Sch@@ lie@@ u of the surroundings .
if the cursor is before or within the command \ \ Beg@@ in { setting } is located at the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when the entry of many ne@@ sting ambient commands can be lost quickly the opposite side . this command close the last environment so that the mer@@ ged ambient structure is not wast@@ ed .
&amp; k@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ groups that are determined by br@@ aces { ... } . among Be@@ am Te@@ X @-@ Group are a few important prec@@ epts which meet from Be@@ verage environment .
with this command there will be re@@ connecting to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the gra@@ dient cl@@ amp .
with this command there will be re@@ connecting to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the br@@ ushed cl@@ amp .
if the cursor is behind or behind the br@@ ushed cl@@ amp of a &amp; tex ; -@@ Group # is located to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
during the entry of many ne@@ sted groups @-@ brack@@ ets can be lost quickly the time @-@ out time . this command close the last group so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; -@@ groups are not atom@@ ized .
in &amp; Lat@@ ex ; two simple beginnings of implementation is used in &amp; k@@ ile ; for the end of the beginning the sign is used . &amp; k@@ ile ; knows this case and for two le@@ as@@ le@@ ep beginnings of the whole .
this automatic inser@@ tion of double beginnings can set up under settings K@@ ile ... La@@ Te@@ X - and off @-@ off .
you can also use m@@ Ã ¤ n@@ der@@ specific settings ( e.g. n@@ german or french ) and thus German or French beginnings . there are also many other languages available .
&quot; in the case of shift ; input &amp; k@@ ile ; an intelligent cel@@ on@@ dro@@ us . if the current position is located within a lists environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or item@@ ize ) , for example , not only a tick @-@ away , but also the command \ \ item . &quot;
inside a tables - setting close &amp; k@@ ile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ \ with a close window @-@ breaking down .
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to be pre@@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or user @-@ defined environments to be supported ; Set up ... La@@ Te@@ X added .
&quot; some users m@@ Ã ¶ pt the columns in tables and all the E@@ t @-@ characters ( amp ; ) among each other . &amp; k@@ ile ; is not trying to adjust this . when this tab@@ ulator is not the place , for the n@@ Ã ¤ n@@ Ã ¤ n@@ ge is , for the columns position of the current table . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; K@@ ate ; already offers a good source code ampli@@ fication , this in &amp; k@@ ile , has been installed in &amp; k@@ ile ; in order to set specific commands ( mostly for the round &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) . they are available three according to your needs and the other two are to set up different working methods below settings K@@ ile ... ampli@@ fication . &quot;
at the beginning a new environment using the command \ \ Beg@@ in { surroundings } is &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ end { setting } according to an empty line ( for the text ) .
&quot; when the return key will be removed , the final letter of the entry is removed and m@@ Ã ¶ pt the complete list . on the other hand , the list can be reduced by entering a further letter . &quot;
&quot; all commands will be written with a brief description of their parameters . alternatively , you can choose from &amp; k@@ ile ; alternatively , a jump to these positions by means of working ank@@ le sky@@ scrap@@ ers &quot;
&quot; under Settings k@@ ile ; establish ... k@@ ile ; ampli@@ fication of settings to these lists are made . it enables you to place different W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ s@@ r &amp; tex ; - and &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ Comm@@ ands as well as guar@@ di@@ ons of general language @-@ to @-@ use . &quot;
&quot; the command mode is for the compreh@@ ension of environments not n@@ Ã ¼ n@@ ally . there is always a few letters with \ \ Beg@@ in . on the other hand , the environments will be used as often that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for completion of the environments . &quot;
&quot; with the call of completion mode , the men@@ Ã ¼ n@@ Ã ¼ n@@ Ã ¼ n@@ Ã ¼ n@@ Ã ¼ n@@ Ã ¼ n@@ Ã ¼ h@@ ensive bu@@ zz the setting will be automatically fil@@ med and it appears \ \ Beg@@ in } . after that , the ambient temperature can be continued in the easi@@ est way and by pressing the input of taste . &quot;
&quot; after this is accomplished , the environment will automatically be closed again . once &amp; k@@ ile ; realis@@ es that it is a lists and is even a first \ \ item command . &quot;
under Settings k@@ ile ; establish ... k@@ ile ; ampli@@ fication can be made to this lists . this mode uses the encryption list of the full @-@ date mode for this lists ; - and &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ Comm@@ ands .
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; support user @-@ defined lists of spac@@ ers , which can be replaced immediately by L@@ Ã ¤ n@@ g@@ ere string . the lists can be set under Settings K@@ ile ... K@@ ile ampli@@ fication , in the example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X included . &quot;
&quot; for example , the letter L has given the letter L and the word sealed mode , the men@@ Ã ¼ le Str@@ g + Alt Le@@ ert@@ aste , the letter L replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot;
&quot; Gro@@ Ã ¨ e W@@ Ã ¶ h@@ amm@@ ers are not helpful for automatic failure . however , it has been established that a lot of wo@@ unds in a document has been written more than once . this offers &amp; k@@ ile ; the ampli@@ fication for all already written wo@@ unds . &quot;
&quot; this mode can set up in full settings for K@@ ile ... K@@ ile ampli@@ fiers are se@@ cluded , here can also be set for the display of the ampli@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; the completed files you can place in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ ile / complete / mode / of the Persian home @-@ folder ) , Dic@@ tionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ pt ) or tex . &quot;
&quot; the dialogue graphics are designed for graphics as easy as possible . for example , the bases of the bases on the graphics formats should be the sections and notice . &quot;
&quot; PS files are not as well @-@ known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for public transport and new announcements of pages . the PDF file is revised and then converted to ps@@ 2@@ pdf in a PDF file . &quot;
&quot; to benefit the results of the work , does not need to be compiled the source code . all the tools are group@@ ed in the men@@ tioning Cre@@ ating , creating converting and create view . &quot;
&quot; for the compile of the source code for viewers such as &amp; oc@@ ular ; or the further conversion can be used by Alt ; 3 . after that , the DVI @-@ file can be used by Alt ; 3 , using Alt ; 4 the DVI ; -@@ file will be converted to a PS file and by Alt ; 5 the PS file can be viewed . &quot;
&quot; when using the instruction fast @-@ building is normally called a viewer after comp@@ iling . should not be used in an embedded viewer , every time will pop up a new window . &quot;
a new project will be submitted to the project new project .... here the following information is asked for the project :
&quot; when the fil@@ ename of the fil@@ ename , the relative path must be specified from the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file . &quot;
the script function of &amp; k@@ ile ; allows to be managed by EC@@ M@@ AS@@ SM -@@ Ko@@ de . the scripts of scripts can be managed in the vertical system .
the API scripts are not yet available and can be used in other versions of &amp; k@@ ile ; nor more .
first must be said that the equi@@ pping of scripts in &amp; k@@ ile ; a system @-@ wide object ( = k@@ ile ) with the following methods :
&quot; &amp; Lat@@ ex ; is a very clever system , in which the basic features can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers a lot of different assistance to support users . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ret@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ tured ; are supplied with many documents . they contain a documentation for the contained packages and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference . &quot;
&quot; this is not only a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather is a complete user manual for the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; - commands and is thus ideal for a certain form@@ atting , as it is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; k@@ ile ; in three important book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; due to the amount of documents with those &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ tured ; delivered , the finding of the correct document does not always include &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ tured ; the small application tex@@ tures , which includes a database of all to &amp; k@@ ile ; exten@@ sively documents and here for a graphical surface area . &quot;
all documents are divided into categories and the biggest advantage is the search for pack@@ et names or stroke . from &amp; k@@ ile ; then only the results are shown .
a double @-@ click with the mouse or the other of the le@@ aven le@@ av@@ ed the viewer for the document .

version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; contains a lot of new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in its integration in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; all these tools use com@@ ic as a surface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ sl@@ t as a base . the combination gives quick , efficient , complete and productive tools . &quot;
&quot; anyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has worked , knows me and how over@@ rag@@ ing it is . lift it still a piece , we give him a graphical interface ! no longer rely on a terminal ; simply click the icon for the XML processor , and ready ! &quot;
&quot; this application expects a index.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if the doc@@ book is found in the ground@@ ing workers . if not , then remove the current worker ment@@ or . if not , then remove the selection of current work@@ stations and enter them in the field of other folder to the desired folder . &quot;
&quot; output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files are deleted every time , if they are started . &quot;
&quot; as already said , everyone who has worked at the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation already worked , knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; there is now a great graphical user interface for this . &quot;
&quot; if the straight @-@ opened file with doc@@ book is , then they simply leave the current worker ment@@ or . if not , then they select current work@@ stations and enter the folder where the doc@@ book can be found . &quot;
&quot; when it comes to an issue on the screen , her file is faul@@ ty . please check the reported bugs and try again . &quot;
&quot; if the veri@@ fiable file is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ine ; , then they let the current file simply p@@ act . if not , delete them on current file the tick and select it to over@@ lap file by means of other file - file selection . &quot;

&quot; should be selected to re@@ working file in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; then , then let the current file sel@@ ects . if not , remove the selection of the file and select the file using the file select file using the other file selection . &quot;
enter the name of the file as the result is named after . the file is usually stored in their home folder .
&quot; the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; themselves may have little to do . thus , the plugin system is very powerful . you can benefit from the additional functionality immediately and do not have to wait until someone can use the thread in a large number of &amp; GUI ; -@@ elements can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; -@@ elements . more about it can be found below . &quot;
&quot; to install a plugin or a part , we begin with the menu plugins . thus the following dialogue is open : &quot;
this dialog allows you to manage all contained plugins and add new add . we describe each &amp; GUI . -@@ element in it :
here you can enter the search ad . when adding plugins without a memory location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to the Search@@ ing of the plugins .
&quot; often , on a project several individuals work in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the indication of team members and these can be configured with shift ; F@@ 7 project Project Properties Tab . &quot;
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Nickname is the user name of the user and serves as a clear identity .
one member can have multiple roles in the project like about both directions and sub@@ project manager .
the user can look out of the list of members of the team who is it . this happens if he looks out the team member from the list and put the button as pressing . the currently selected member ( their identi@@ fiers ) appears f@@ et after you are : text .
&quot; sur@@ names and the attitude of their own identity are important in terms of news and notes , see for further information on comments . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the overview of your team , there is another advantage by the acquisition of the members of the team : it can be an event created for information to the team@@ leader when something particular happens . see in for further information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that are carried out when something particular in the project happens . an example would be seen when a file is saved , or the sending of a message if a file is saved , or a script that will add a file into CV@@ S , as soon as they are added to the project &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; on the page event configuration of the shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
an E@@ Mail is sent to the add@@ res@@ see in the receiver list . the Ad@@ res@@ sat can be a team or sub@@ project leader . see in where such managers will be set up .
note are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
note notes is simple . it may be chosen either the note -@@ entry from the Editor @-@ context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keywords in a comment area followed by An@@ strange text .
&quot; notes can be sent to a determ@@ in@@ able member of the team . in this case , the syntax of the comm@@ ot@@ ation ( nickname ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , the nickname of the one project : team@@ leader Sub@@ project leaders should be specified in the project manager and sub@@ project leadership should be specified in the following examples below . &quot;
&quot; sur@@ names and roles @-@ names are independent of large or small ten@@ ders , but spaces around the brack@@ ets and the : make the note invali@@ d . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scripts and form@@ atting , the DT@@ D @-@ agn@@ os@@ tic is and web@@ based form@@ atting and scri@@ pting languages supported . &quot;
&quot; the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only via &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in . &quot;
the settings can be set up using Settings Qu@@ anta ... called File . diesel dialog extends over some pages that will be dealt with each other .
&quot; the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ine ; regarding tags , including car @-@ completion can be changed . the entries are : &quot;
&quot; large / short @-@ term of tags : large / small @-@ recording of automatically attached tags . normal Groß / inf@@ lic@@ en@@ ings means , the tags will be added as they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; large / sli@@ ders of attri@@ butions : large / sli@@ pped of automatically attached attributes , the attributes are added to the attributes , as described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; optional tags automatically conclude : if p@@ act , it is optional for tags , for which the closing day is optional , this immediately after the &amp; gt ; inserted . &quot;
&quot; optional tags automatically conclude , as above for all other tags with the exception of the simple tags . &quot;
&quot; start and finish @-@ day automatically update : if switched , the appropriate closing days will be changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic determination of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters in the appropriate code during the inser@@ tion .
M@@ IME types : Mim@@ e@@ types available for detection of different types of files . using the default the default order can be recovered .
standard char@@ en@@ coding : en@@ coding of newly created or in other way than with file Open open files ( where the coding of the file can be passed ) . this setting here is extr@@ acted from the same in the project properties in case a project is loaded .
&quot; standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files , whose DT@@ D is not recognized . this attitude here is extr@@ acted from the same in the project properties , if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; create a backup copies : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; created regularly backup copies , allowing the document to be restored by this backup . this is not the same as the storage of the file . even for not stored documents , a backup will be added regularly , according to the specified time . &quot;
&quot; the Preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor area or in a separate view ( or the documentation in a box leader ) , which makes it possible to view the documentation , preview and the source code at the same time . &quot;
put the window settings on the standard return to the next start is useful when the user interface has come through changing the MDI modes and do@@ cking / depend on views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ ected layout command parameters .
the warning @-@ type section serves the taxes of the possibility of dis@@ able the display of warnings carried out by warning on the hook of no longer .
&quot; the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it may change the display of symbols instead of scripts , as well as the syn@@ cing behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source code in shared mode . with regard to the different modes . &quot;
&quot; here , the Par@@ ser and the structure tree , which represents the figure of the par@@ ser no@@ des in the document to be adjusted in detail . &quot;
&quot; in the field of mouse @-@ clicking on the structural tree , the following action is possible to change the action taken by clicking the structural tree with the mouse buttons solved . &quot;
&quot; in the field of structural tree settings , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree is to be opened and how deep when changing the structural tree will be opened automatically . blank no@@ des are the empty spaces in the text , while blank groups such are found in which the current document is not found an item . &quot;
&quot; the area to commemor@@ ate abbreviations ( a type of templates ) which are un@@ folds during loading . abbreviations are valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s , this means , it can be a valid group for PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ cl@@ ause abbreviation slightly means than in a group valid for Jav@@ ascript . &quot;
&quot; here , the plugins are managed . plug @-@ in are the part @-@ applications of the third @-@ enabled application , which can be re @-@ used by any part @-@ capable application , the most famous &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; when inser@@ ting a plugin must be specified : &quot;
address : the path to the plugin if it is not at a stand where $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / lib .
&quot; entry : this information is transferred to the plug @-@ in in the start@@ up , so it can open the current file , the folder folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; &quot; Only @-@ L@@ ese &quot; &quot; mode load : check whether the plugin den@@ oun@@ ce the store . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ parts usually refuse the load when this option is not selected . &quot;
&quot; check the plug @-@ in : is this activated , then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; whether the entered information is correct . pick up the entry is not available , but it will be installed later . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ine ; from version 3.3 , the troub@@ les@@ hooting was completely re@@ designed . the support for the un@@ necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger has been set out , as well as support for the db@@ g Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead of which a de@@ bu@@ gger plugin was implemented , the different impl@@ ement@@ ations made via plug @-@ ins . &quot;
&quot; currently , only a plugin available , the support for the use of &amp; g@@ bed ; in@@ qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &quot;
the use of the de@@ bug for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the Options button next to the de@@ bu@@ gger @-@ plug @-@ in box you can change the specific settings .
&quot; if a project is enabled a de@@ bu@@ gger , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ user interface : &quot;
a view in which the content of super@@ vis@@ aged variables is displayed . usually appears in the left Dock .
&quot; one view , in which all suit points , are listed with ig@@ rap@@ ids and conditions . usually , appears in the lower dock . &quot;
one view in which the output is displayed ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bug . appears normally in the lower dock .
&quot; depending on the supported functions of the de@@ trigger function , everything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; with this action the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger , if required , or she shares the plugin with , on de@@ gan@@ ing demands . this action is opened by default , when a project is opened , that in case the case is not going to be respected . &quot;
the counter@@ piece to de@@ bu@@ gger starts the meeting . closes the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the foli@@ age to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to initi@@ ate a de@@ bug requirement . this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document . the issue of this requirement is displayed in the view of de@@ bu@@ gger issue .
&quot; points the de@@ bu@@ gger to begin with the execution of the script and provide information on the roof@@ ed variables as well as the current line has been completed . if this happens during the script will commen@@ ce the execution , the script will start with the request . &quot;
&quot; points the de@@ bu@@ gger to start with the execution of the script , without information on vig@@ il@@ ted variables and the current cel@@ esti@@ al number . if this happens during a script running , the execution takes place once a request will be made . &quot;
the de@@ bu@@ gger leads the next assignment in the script without entering the functions or includes :
&quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger leads the next assignment in the script , with if possible in functions and includes error @-@ adjusted . &quot;
&quot; points the de@@ bu@@ gger to go to the statement and go to the next one , as if there were the current one . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog , in which a variable or an expression can be entered , the super@@ vised value will appear in the variable view . &quot;
with this dialog a variable can be entered or set a new value of variable variable .

&quot; type E@@ di@@ zer package ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to give support for Mark@@ up@@ - and scri@@ pting languages . they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; skills such as car @-@ complete and node @-@ trees ; a quick , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE . for web@@ developers , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; s &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two ways , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script @-@ languages and the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically generated from an existing DT@@ D . see for details on conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; son@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also toolbar . short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the origin@@ als , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ee ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; yourself . the toolbar enable quick inser@@ ting tags in a document without danger of a letter . &quot;
&quot; tag folders are nothing but folder . you only contain the &amp; mal@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . day folder carry the name of the descri@@ p@@ ation language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.01 @-@ 64 ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declar@@ es whether they are necessary , or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible to enable other users a better insight and more information in working with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes every element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits is shown in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of an diary document . it may contain only once in a document . it may contain the definition of many tags , but contains as only @-@ element type over itself otherwise . &quot;
the type of tags is a script function . when using it &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only for the day type class valid . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only for the type meth@@ od valid . gives the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the day has a much @-@ attri@@ bute @-@ group and the attributes within this tags can be added to each other day . ( only family 1 ) &quot;
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; Day determined . this is a mere element type element .
describes a attri@@ bute of a tags . this item can only happen once for any attri@@ bute . it places the name and type of the attri@@ bute . additionally it contains other tags that will describe how this attri@@ bute will be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a mere element type .
provides the source of source texts for the attributes in the day editing dialog and in the attri@@ bute @-@ tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to reach the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the data source .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a cutting @-@ expression and an methodology , which may be passed on to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , that means the name of the current tags . &quot;
a hop@@ per day that the elements of a list may be group@@ ed together . it can happen for a attri@@ bute description only once . it is a mere sub@@ type element .
lay the position of the attri@@ bute of a tags within a dialog box . this day may occur for any attri@@ bute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the element is empty .
indicates the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be present for each field in dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; und &amp; lt ; label &gt; Day ) . this item is empty .
&quot; indicates a list of elements that may occur within the defined tags . this element is an only @-@ item type . &quot;
indicates a list of elements that end a day . this item is an only element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; -@@ declaration ; ? XML version = 1.0 en@@ coding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be neat and closed .
&quot; do not affect anything but pay attention to &amp; and &amp; lt ; , particularly in elements like &amp; lt ; Tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; text &gt; to be replaced . this to be replaced , but some pieces of the work would disappear . &quot;
&quot; to check the Tag@@ XML files , the tools can start dialogue at the top of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Windows to start and vali@@ dated Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . to choose another dialog will appear to follow the simple instructions . &quot;
&quot; this function is currently not available . at present , the check only takes place when loading the diary files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; in the following an example for a family 1 diary file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3C ; &amp; XML ; -@@ sch@@ ema . the fil@@ ename for this diary @-@ file should be schem@@ a.@@ day . &quot;
&quot; in the following an example for a functioning family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the fil@@ ename of this diary @-@ file should be over@@ lo@@ ad@@ .@@ tag . &quot;
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; en@@ coding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag &gt; &amp; lt ; tag = &quot; &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; string _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; option &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the &amp; z@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is as pretty simple and there is an editor to accessible via DT@@ D Bear@@ be@@ ite DT@@ D settings . this can be di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it should be created with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for every higher version . name = DT@@ D statement . ( - / DT@@ D HTML 4.01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Nickname = The simplified name of the DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nickname . &quot;
an action can set up with settings and create actions ... click on New Action leads to the same dialogue :
&quot; this action is designated ke@@ zel . with clicking the button of the button , one button can be assigned to a keyboard short@@ cut ; with one is the current keyboard short@@ cut . &quot;
the sim@@ pl@@ est actions . it can be entered a text in the detailed settings and when carrying out the action this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below .
&quot; this is the Most Power@@ ful shareholder . with the help of this action , external applications can be used ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) to change the document or as entering ( or parts of the document ) , then the quick start @-@ dialog or the various See in ... campaigns for the ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ EP@@ s . &quot;
&quot; first , the name of the script and interpre@@ ter will be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Script@@ .@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scri@@ pt@@ ake variable in the command line : $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other specific variable that can be used in the command line : &quot;
% f : we will be replaced with the URL of the current document . in the event of a local document file : / from the document name .
% pi@@ d : will be replaced with the P@@ ID of the running &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it is replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance is running the text is unique to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; by the external script .
the parameters for this event is normally the fil@@ ename of the current document or the path to the project file .
&quot; in addition to the above mentioned methods , a script may withdraw from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; at the default input . in the drop @-@ box entry can be determined what to send to the default . possibilities are : &quot;
selected Text : the selected section of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually recommended only with this setting .
&quot; according to the input , the output of the finished application can be re@@ directed . there are two types of issue : normal output , on the default output list . it can be specified what has to be done with the default output written by which the output will be adjusted to : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups . in the given case it is not too many , therefore one can create a toolbar with the name of the market . &quot;
&quot; once a toolbar is added , you must add actions and configure . select Settings settings . &quot;
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press New Action Kn@@ op@@ ter at the bottom of the window will start the operation mode .
complete all the required fields and add it to the appropriate toolbar .
&quot; complete everything and , if the day has attributes and you plan to plan their use , enable dialog &quot; &quot; Day &quot; , &quot; if available , so that a entry in using the action is possible . &quot;
Ig@@ or ! is that a ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? replace it before we have difficulty .
&quot; to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ cia ; use from the &amp; k@@ menu ; , graphic further programs ( or where else it is located in its distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ con@@ ium ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 Pixel , we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , choose Edit size others . &quot;
&quot; please note that the armed symbol is not only helps you to remember what the action is doing , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . &quot;
&quot; with regard to that the day started , I decided to create a start@@ up as a symbol . due to the use of green ( green is usually interpreted as a symbol , star@@ ed , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user , that assu@@ mptions this symbol one &amp; lt ; start @-@ day in the current document . &quot;
&quot; after creating the symbol , it has to be associated with the promotion . this happens over the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the desired action . besides the text field there is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder where the stored icon is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the touch button and continue with other tags , so there are still what gives , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot;
suppose you want to complement some usual &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ine ; -@@ functions to the toolbar set out or it should set this at a better review by some separ@@ ators . open the toolbar set out dialog via settings toolbar . make sure that the desired toolbar is selected .
&quot; I want to select the separ@@ ator ( quite left above ) for my toolbar , that is to be added to the toolbar you press the arrow key to the right . this adds the item to the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I want to access the cross @-@ section preview for example . I will select it and add to the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; please note how the separ@@ ators support the group@@ ing . somebody who does not know my work@@ ings , could believe that the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button is the opposite of the start @-@ button . &quot;
the new toolbar must be tested by pro@@ vis@@ ing of all symbols to ensure that everything works .
&quot; when new XML does not exist in the right folder . after Neu@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be saved in the right folder , but your toolbar ( s ) should be saved in the right folder ( s ) , if a file is opened from the corresponding type . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the one @-@ mentioned extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for normal users is the opportunity to add documentation for the scri@@ pting language or the shape , which you like most . therefore , this chapter , how I create a &amp; PHP ; -@@ document tree for my personal use . &quot;
&quot; before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ repository , whether someone has done this for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you have to search an existing documentation for form@@ atting and script / etc . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . then the first part is left to you , the second we treat you here . &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = pf@@ ad , relative to this file , for example ph@@ p@@ 42 / # 2 = Sec@@ tion@@ .html section 2 = Sec@@ tion@@ .html ... &#91; Con@@ text &#93; Con@@ text Section 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ .html ... &#91; Con@@ text &#93; Con@@ text = 1 = 1 = 1 = 1 &quot;
the section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the document tree . for example you see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation such a thing :
# K@@ DE config File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = p@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element = Table of Cont@@ ents , # getting started , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents ... Language Reference = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ ag@@ e.@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tac@@ tic ... &quot;
note the # getting started and Language Reference . that shows that it is about sub@@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the chess problems ( except by reason ) m@@ das@@ h ; but try it yourself .
you remember that the document is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and in@@ consequ@@ ent at the upper end of the construction site &amp; m@@ das@@ h ; folder will be displayed ! ) .
&quot; spaces affect nothing but watch out on &amp; and &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; Resources &quot;
&quot; the folder is the area of do@@ cr@@ c file that serves to be displayed in the context of context @-@ sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; script the documentation for the mys@@ ql _ fetch _ array _ array should be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context List ( Con@@ text@@ list ) and the file requirements . &quot;
&quot; a simple list of in separate context @-@ elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) . &quot;
&quot; now you can simply save your file do@@ cr@@ c / share / apps / qu@@ anta / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as , as you have this in your file do@@ cr@@ c and copy your html documentation there . &quot;
&quot; if you are sure that these are good and worth it to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation have been used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ repository for the use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Community . they will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web@@ developer platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; you are not alone . it is possible to divide the separ@@ ating resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , toolbar with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; the resources can be sent by e @-@ mail to friends , partners or otherwise to whom will send us an email menu item , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) send to an email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts . &quot;
&quot; the resources can be uploaded to our main archive , from where all the others &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ users can download it . the contributions are checked and only available if our team needs them as correct and us@@ fully for publication . with this , the origin of the resources is guaranteed , both for our team and for later users . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading you are asked for their private G@@ PG keys ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase will not be saved ) , or in the case that you have multiple keys you can choose to choose . in the dialog box you need to stay ( URL _ preview can remain empty ) and with the click of OK the high load are started . &quot;
&quot; the up@@ loading can upload from the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , the toolbar toolbar upload , and in the context menu of files and folders in the Tem@@ plates and scripts menu . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , even before installing , investig@@ ating &amp; qu@@ ant@@ agon@@ eness of the resource by testing the integrity and Sig@@ ni@@ fication . in case of problems we war@@ ned it and it can then be abandoned . please check the integrity and the resource correct , a message appears with the specification of the origin@@ ator of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work on XML @-@ languages , which is currently not created by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , which is currently being created by creating a D@@ TE@@ P package . it can be time @-@ consuming , because hundreds of day files in the day @-@ XML format may be necessary . there is the sim@@ pler path to convert a DT@@ D automatically into a D@@ TE@@ P package . &quot;
&quot; the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D shop and convert a DT@@ D menu . select the .@@ d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description which is to be used . afterwards , the following dialogue will be published : &quot;
target name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; will be written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
&quot; DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE definition : the string set , which in the ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE tag , such as HTML P@@ UB@@ LI@@ C - / / W@@ 3C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.01 Transi@@ tional / / EN http : / / www.w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ m@@ l@@ 4 / lo@@ ose@@ .@@ d@@ t@@ d will appear
&quot; adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when activated , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; according to the transformation the &amp; na@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; Editor , with the details of newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to utilize this option . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; there are several key concepts . to consider these to understand and benefit full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ agon@@ isms . this chapter they try to bring them precisely these concepts , without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ agon@@ isms ; &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it is divided into three areas : global , locally and proj@@ ected . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for each , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; use , available . from toolbar via actions is , stored in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this enables the group of administr@@ ators different materials , actions and patterns in the global tree , which can then be available in a multi @-@ user environment . &quot;
local elements represent a personal collection of web developers for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and toolbar . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be all available from &amp; CSS ; -@@ patterns with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply said this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project for making common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project .
&quot; the &amp; Qu@@ antum ; MDI ; consists of some main areas : the editors window , the construction views , the Kart@@ ei@@ re@@ ites with info and the toolbar . please hit in , and for further information on these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click the Kart@@ ing with the right mouse button , to get a context menu with the current documents required , re@@ load , delete or up@@ loading of the document , jump to a book@@ marks or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right @-@ click in the editor menu lead to a further context menu regarding the edited document content , such as basic processing steps ( cut / paste / paste ) , processing of the cursor on the mouse @-@ cursor or opening of the file , if the string under the mouse po@@ inter is referred to a file . &quot;
&quot; at the top of the editor , the toolbar of the editors is currently being shown &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.01 transi@@ tional as standard , for which a set of material manufacturers will be shown . in the course of further development of tools &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the toolbar are adapted to the new functions and associated user needs . &quot;
&quot; the use of toolbar is really easy . if they want to insert a simple day , for example &amp; lt ; then click on the icon that you want to insert the day . now they can insert the data for this just one day , then you can insert the data for this just one day ( like anchor ) , you can insert in a dialog different fields . &quot;
&quot; the construction views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow it to open up and navigate in the information on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to open them and to strip . in the representation with Kart@@ ei@@ re@@ ites are available for files , project , sample structure , scripts , attributes , attributes and documentation . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this view shows all files in the project and allows the car@@ et@@ akers of the files in the project by right mouse click . actions like adding , removing , loading , or delet@@ ing the files from the storage medium with which then the context @-@ menu can be performed . &quot;
&quot; another option of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ine ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , programming , a whole website &amp; etc . there are all options open . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories , depending on which context it is used . global templates are always available , local templates for the corresponding users and templates in projects are available only in the project . &quot;
&quot; here you will find information on available scripts . the concept of integration into Global , local and project also works here . by clicking on the right mouse button you can call the available information to a script . &quot;
&quot; with this view , you can view the internal structure of the active document . through links @-@ click of the element , the cursor is set on the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking an element a list of commands in relation to navigation and refres@@ her of the tree will open . &quot;
&quot; this tree appears under the other construction views . with it , it can change rapidly attributes and nam@@ esp@@ ace . the entry into the contents of a registr@@ ar system allows the change of all available attributes with few mouse clicks . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation on the web @-@ technology for your development . we can create custom documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &quot; documentation site , you can create own documentation , and by adding an folder doc to a project may be ed@@ ged and viewed . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus : two card @-@ leader at the bottom of the window , can be reached via the useful information : the news window and the problem window . &quot;
&quot; this card @-@ leader indicates information on each in Qu@@ anta current script . so , e.g. the DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to the DT@@ D show . &quot;
&quot; this card pioneer shows all errors in the market @-@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts , which will be executed , give all the messages ( as there are ) in this window . &quot;
&quot; the bat@@ ches , toolbar are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command indicated . the chocolate is the opportunity to define own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a toolbar with e @-@ mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the toolbar as a comp@@ uted T@@ ar archive about &amp; k@@ mail ; . if you get a toolbar inside an e @-@ mail , they can assure them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ine ; how any other secure and load ! &quot;
&quot; it is reasonable , if you want to adjust the place of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ine ; auto@@ conf requested a number of options that can be delivered to the configure script . to complete a complete list of options , enter . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed here . &quot;
&quot; if you have problems with the types of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ine ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder contains . also , you should ensure that there is no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in P@@ AT@@ H in front of her bin folder . the same goes for &amp; Q@@ t . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus : is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has been optimized for a rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
&quot; during an effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; Editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , started with a nah@@ able idea , what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it would be , if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it would now , this would make him an absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; not longer on re@@ ines &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now , is already far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . together , if one can define it in &amp; XML ; then , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; be the appropriate &amp; IDE . &quot;
&quot; now , to the above @-@ mentioned claim has to be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product developed on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; development community is not only possible that someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ ru@@ mo@@ urs is not only all possible , but allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to expand how they need it for their needs . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; allows we@@ ar@@ sing the usage of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( MDI ; ) . this can extend the productivity almost every task . by using the program , they can add &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ine . ( more about it can be found in . ) &quot;
&quot; &amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for a fast web development , and quickly expanded to a well @-@ balanced editor with many powerful functions . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way connected to commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers released the GPL @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; more in the details of the documentation is available with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or enter help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently developed and maintained by Eric Laf@@ fo@@ on sequ@@ it@@ ur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; a fast access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time when you open a file that is not on it , whereby the oldest entry is taken out . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to store code parts and whole files as templates for later use . take a look at the section on templates . you should try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template , only a bug is reported . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ ts when inser@@ ting out of the clip@@ board there are specialized signs for the &quot; &quot; HTML tags , &quot; so that they are displayed correctly and not understood by the browser as a form@@ att@@ acking instruction . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ ts the text from the clip@@ board in &amp; URL ; tr@@ acker , which is the correct way to inser@@ ting special signs and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . in the first place to insert &amp; URL ; s in the anchor day . &quot;
enables the log @-@ selection of or out . this allows you to select text blocks with the help of &amp; Shift ; taste .
go straight to a fork number . this is very helpful when your &amp; PHP ; -@@ Script error messages !
search a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined cli@@ pping to help you .
&quot; shows the news window , or not on . that &apos;s the window , in which you see the display of scripts and de@@ bu@@ gger . &quot;
&quot; - and switching of problem re@@ por@@ ters at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem re@@ porter is activated , once you change to the structural tree . &quot;
displays the toolbar icons in the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
&quot; if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with the entries of previous or neighbour , depending on the position of the cursor on the document . &quot;
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu according to the fil@@ ename of the other documents .
opens an existing project from hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ projects are stored with the file sending .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog to enter files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied into the project directory .
&quot; searches for the project directory to new files that could be there . this allows , e.g. video files in your project folders or a sub@@ folder to copy , and add it to the project . &quot;
loads the files in your project on the server high . the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; starting from and whether you have downloaded further inputs / output modules ( K@@ IO Sl@@ aves ) .
&quot; settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project managed . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ projects can be found in detail . &quot;
loads a project toolbar . these are stored in project you / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them this project .
&quot; a dialog to save your toolbar . allows you to select the type of the toolbar , locally or project . &quot;
opens a dialog to add a new toolbar . this creates only the name . actions must be saved by means of settings ... added by means of the toolbar and you will store the toolbar you want to store the toolbar .
&quot; remo@@ ves a toolbar from the field of view . delet@@ es it not from hard disk . if you have not saved the toolbar , you will be asked if you want to do it . &quot;
&quot; with this , you can send their own toolbar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ team , so that the toolbar is present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message using the toolbar as app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
enables the up@@ loading of toolbar on the main server where any other can access it . see in .
invite one &amp; DT@@ D ; that made you or irrit@@ ating someone else and convert into the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own review format .
&quot; up@@ loading / refresh of the du@@ ti@@ ties from the &amp; DT@@ D ; . is useful if the ducks from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is advisable to renew without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and a writing per@@ missions in the global K@@ DE folder is not present , the store . &quot;
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags , which are available in the currently loaded toolbar , is available in the tags menu a sub @-@ menu standard , which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool . &quot;
&quot; allows access to the current day entry dialog , if there is one . this entry is always present in the menu Tags , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub @-@ menus . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates or de@@ activated the intelligent inser@@ ting of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ Ds . smart one means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the inser@@ ting using toolbar without ref@@ rain from this day to this place . &quot;
&quot; in the plugins menu , the available plug @-@ ins are listed under the menu mentioned above . click on the activated plug @-@ in plugins . &quot;
select the syn@@ tac@@ eous mode for the current file . the list of available shut@@ ters depends on the options available .
&quot; choose the type of tick @-@ labels . very useful when you know people , the other OS platforms to use . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh . &quot;
checks the syntax of the current document based on the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; due to the external application of tidy .
instant switching between the different types of the user interface . by some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries can cause a change of time or un@@ beautiful graphics . recommended the card @-@ card mode which is also the default mode which is also the default mode which is displayed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier .
&quot; additionally , this menu contains an entry to each open sub@@ window . with a selection of an entry , the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated . &quot;
enables the display of the status bar at the bottom of the bottom of the bottom units ; main window to or from .
&quot; the changes in this dialog are using any application that use the K@@ HTML @-@ Part , including the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ web browser . &quot;
directed the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; K@@ ate ; you can find details .
&quot; a dialog appears , in which you can delete entries from the toolbar or which you can add and change the sequences . &quot;
&quot; this should generate a help in accordance with the mouse cursor , but is not implemented yet . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high @-@ quality product that freely available and freely licensed , but like with any open source project developers can always assist help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form you find here the way . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled out on the top of the project , as after filling out the project called the whole directory tree for the rest of the project . all these paths and author @-@ information fields can be completed later with shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project to enter , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name file is automatically filled . &quot;
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default it has the name of the project in small letters and without a blank character with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
&quot; here you can access the server address of the machine , to which one wants to access local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exemp@@ .de ) or a IP @-@ address ( 127@@ .0@@ .0.@@ 1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; you can be empty this field empty , the default settings of the selected recording may be used . depending on the setting of the remote computer it could be an adaptation needed . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where the templates will be stored for the project . it is a rel@@ ational path to the project and by default templates . if a common collection of files used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; that is the folder where the toolbar is stored for the project . it is a rel@@ ational path to project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
this allows you to insert files from the local file system into the project . you can select multiple files or whole folders .
&quot; this setting is great if you have static Web@@ contents you download and change . at server scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc . ) one must proceed differently . &quot;
&quot; leave if files , which are located somewhere in the main folder of the project . if a project is commen@@ ced on new , not hook . &quot;
this option will display all files and folders within the main folder and you can make a precise selection after th@@ inner .
&quot; this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by h@@ aken or , by removing the tick , cl@@ amps out of the project . &quot;
&quot; the last screen of the new project assistant contains three settings that can simplify your work . these settings can be modified in the menu with project properties in the field window , or modified with the Keyboard @-@ zel Shift ; F@@ 7 . &quot;
some settings correspond to those in the project assist@@ ants and are described in . additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ ename ( Plac@@ eholders is possible ) that will be re@@ produced on project @-@ related operations like about project ord@@ ner .
&quot; additional option to the top , also files that are listed in .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project . &quot;
the project view that will be loaded at the opening of the project . it can be read more about project insights .
&quot; with this , the desired de@@ bu@@ gger can be selected . currently only Gub@@ ed is supported . more information about Gub@@ ed can be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin can be set with the Options button . in the de@@ bug@@ ging is described . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window profiles , up@@ loading profiles can be set in ) as well as the display of a construction panel for the content of the server for each profile , by reve@@ aling a separate construction panel for every profile . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mail@@ ing list . see in the details . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window event , one can switch event @-@ actions and add these actions to change or delete . event actions are carried out when a previously defined event occurs , such as the She@@ er of a file . see in the details . &quot;
&quot; standard opens &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus : the last project , which was opened . this behavior can currently not be influenced . &quot;
to open a different project you can open the project ... from the menu project or the icon project open from the toolbar . the dialog project will open and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
&quot; if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus : closed , the project file will be automatically saved . you will be asked if you make changes before leaving when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . the same happens if you load a new project . &quot;
project presentation gives free access to the files in the project . where the files can be managed in the current project .
&quot; folder be@@ have to be@@ have , however , are missing the entries Open and Open with ... in the right mouse @-@ click context menu : &quot;
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the site of the high @-@ file files .
&quot; removing the current profile . if only more a profile is available , the button is termin@@ ated to prevent the Rem@@ ove . &quot;
the password is kept in core storage and for@@ ce@@ ful when program forget . this possibility is useful if most common up@@ loading files needed is needed and the rather un@@ safe password can be saved on the record -@@ option not .
this will stop the transmission or simply exit the dialog if you change your opinion prior to the up@@ loading .
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many up@@ loading profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) will be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog will be displayed : &quot;
&quot; this is the name of the server , to which the files are to be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or a IP address function . &quot;
&quot; the transfer protocol for the up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed K@@ IO Sl@@ aves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and NFS . &quot;
&quot; the port for the transfer . usually this does not have to be changed , except the network administrator maintains a service not at the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your att@@ ain@@ ment this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it after your discretion . the password is stored on the record , so that it can &apos;t be read on the plate , but everyone can easily be read at the plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is only one set of files and toolbar . it can be loaded in a project many views , i.e. , by simple exchange of view , various files and toolbar are loaded and replace the currently open files and toolbar . &quot;
&quot; views can be opened in the menu project or the project toolbar , accessible via settings of the toolbar panel , opened or deleted . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ine , with which one has to do most . this helps not only increase productivity but also allows adjustment of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ine ; to the own way of working . &quot;
as mentioned above are the toolbar located in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; best distingu@@ ish@@ able via the menu toolbar . use and hints differ . the adding of toolbar is handled below in the section Ad@@ ding of toolbar .
&quot; the toolbar and the symbols may be set to be adjusted either by context menu ( right @-@ click on the toolbar ( right @-@ click on the toolbar , which can be executed with new tools , which can be specified in dialog , where actions can be visible on this or other toolbar . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a toolbar , in addition the entries will remove action and display action , the self @-@ explan@@ atory process . &quot;
the toolbar and actions on them can set up in the menu with settings toolbar and set settings .
&quot; templates are essentially documentary code , code sni@@ el and files for link@@ age . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used Tem@@ plates like an experienced fil@@ es@@ ystem with extended organisation and interfaces . you can copy , move or each of the system existing directory in the pre@@ dat@@ ory tree ; in about the restrictions you have for the file system . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; included templates have conditions for their application . please read the conditions at the beginning of any template specified before using .
&quot; binary is all , what is not pur@@ er text . it can be any file except text , i.e. pictures , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc . binary templates will normally be inserted in documents using link@@ ages ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the pre@@ lu@@ de tree under global templates . further information on the Tem@@ plates tree is available . &quot;
documents can be created by each text type . on the basis of these templates you can be created new documents . you are a simple ru@@ m@@ ors for the purpose and organiz@@ es the work in appropriate way to efficiently locate efficiently . some examples can be found in the bearing @-@ tree under global templates . see in for more information about Tem@@ plates .
this kind of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area is always included in the documents . you can find everything from a comment via a complete package on Jav@@ ascript or Perl basis . some examples are available in the pre@@ historic tree under global templates . see for more information about Tem@@ plates .
&quot; as the name says , these Tem@@ plates serve for all sites as templates . they are a collection of various documents which can be organized in a folder structure , together in a comp@@ ressed t@@ ar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; create an documentation structure according to Bel@@ i@@ eben ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc . ) and select File As template save as local template .... &quot;
&quot; once this is done , notice that ( even if it was not saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project @-@ tree . look at the fore@@ front tree under project templates . &quot;
&quot; select Text in your document and click Save as a template as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can easily be drag@@ ged with drag@@ ging and retri@@ ev@@ ing on the buil@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only copy to a preview folder . you can use all the file administration functions to be used , such as drag@@ ons or inser@@ ting or insert the file tree from Kon@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; you can select in the file tree or in the project @-@ directory tree view on a folder on the right and secure site template , select a name for the template and secure . by default , it can be used as local or global template . &quot;
project templates enable a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can insert head@@ lines and foot@@ lines or dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; design files or using them . additionally you can keep some things when using templates into projects very deeply .
the submission structure in the under@@ window Tem@@ plates is based on the files listed in $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates / templates . each of this folder corresponds one of four types of containers as above .
to set the behavior of a folder in the pre @-@ storage overview of the right mouse button on the folder and in the context menu tab appears . the following dialog appears :
&quot; a drop @-@ down with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is de@@ du@@ cted , as soon as El@@ ter@@ restrial attributes . &quot;
&quot; this is activated by default , and fits all except the stem cell in the pre @-@ deposits . if a regular folder would be dis@@ able , unless they appear to appear in this path . in the event of a normal folder , the f@@ oo@@ h would appear with something like text construction . if nothing appears , one is probably located in a regular folder . &quot;
permit release or set text for templates in this folder . this could be general he@@ aders or foot@@ paths to all templates for a specific project and allows copying images into a folder with special Head@@ lines / foot@@ path .
&quot; in addition , you can press right mouse button ( to indicate right mouse button ) via a full instruction collection for adding folders or copy and insert templates from one place to another . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus : offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; the first mode re@@ places the code editor in two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor .
the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor works as follows : it appears as a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; XHTML ; - page and a cursor ; then you can edit and see if necessary changes in the V@@ PL ; Editor in source code is visible .
&quot; working with V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor to a document , which is &amp; PHP ; contains , displays a small green symbol the pres@@ ets of &amp; PHP ; -@@ source . it is not possible to edit this directly using the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor . there is no plans to change this Code . &quot;
&quot; the second mode is just like the first one , except that at the same time , the changes in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor is already activated , the button moves the active cursor from one window to the other , whereby the position will be kept in the document . &quot;
&quot; the synchron@@ isation between the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the sourc@@ ec@@ ode editor will be set up via settings Qu@@ anta ; -@@ view can be set forth between synchronization after a click or automatically . in the selection automatically , the recommendation is set to be set . in principle the recommendation is valid : a small pot for fast computer and a large sp@@ ying for slow . &quot;
&quot; suppose you want to change the title of the website , the tools of docum@@ ent@@ properties can choose from . this makes the editing of invisible tags at work with V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor is also called , once a new document is created with V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor . this makes it possible to change the following : &quot;
Met@@ a @-@ tags will provide the storage of information on the document yourself e.g. keywords for internet search engines . Met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below or removed . one click into the list allows to modify the content , e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword . &quot;
CSS @-@ rules are the new way of shaping the look of pages in the browser . you can add CSS @-@ rules with the buttons under the list or delete . a change on the list is possible exactly as with the met@@ a @-@ elements . the editing of CSS @-@ rules are currently not supported .
it is possible to record an external CSS @-@ style property by pressing on the file button and select the corresponding file .
&quot; the use of the cursor is like in a text processing , possible by filling with the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the mark@@ er works as usual . text can be inserted through typ@@ ing and er@@ ased by means of return or distance . &quot;
&quot; inser@@ ting tags will be made in the same way over the toolbar editor , made . it is to be noted that inser@@ ting tags previously already existing identi@@ fiers are not removed , e.g. if an an@@ ker @-@ day , surrounded with text , every other converted anchor will be removed . &quot;
&quot; some of the toolbar such as the tables assistant or the lists assistant are disabled . you will later use in the &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists products must be used . &quot;
&quot; &amp; x@@ sl@@ db@@ g ; is a tool for investigation of styl@@ esho@@ es . in contrast to other programs for styl@@ esho@@ es , the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of the styl@@ istic situation can be prosec@@ uted . &quot;
&quot; to compile &amp; x@@ sl@@ db@@ g ; we need to compile excluding &amp; k@@ de ; nor the libraries lib@@ x@@ sl@@ t , li@@ bex@@ sl@@ t and lib@@ x@@ ml which are present in a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ; already existing . &quot;

&quot; x@@ sl@@ db@@ g determines the complete path from a fil@@ ename without a paths . file name in the same folder as the top loaded style fil@@ er con x@@ sl@@ db@@ g is loaded for example a sty@@ li@@ da@@ end@@ at@@ ei . / en / x@@ sl@@ do@@ c.@@ x@@ sl , the following entry is possible : &quot;

there are many graphical tools for compar@@ ing . why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly why I wrote .
&quot; the mer@@ ging was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors had done so many changes and at the same time had corrected a lot of changes at the same time . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts in mer@@ ging . &quot;
&quot; the program used by me would only showed me the modified lines , but I could not see what changed within these lines . and there was no evidence of the places where perhaps only the initi@@ ation had changed . the mer@@ ging of these changes was a small night@@ mare . &quot;
that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within one line and changes to white signs . later still a lot of further useful features were added .
&quot; if you want to compare for example quickly , just copy it to the clip@@ board and paste it into one of the compar@@ ative window . &quot;
&quot; a function that made a lot of work , was the compar@@ ing and mer@@ ging of folders . this function was converted &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full @-@ value file browser . &quot;
&quot; also 3 @-@ way connections will be fully supported . this is useful when two people work independently of one piece of co@@ de and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps the dis@@ solving reporting . in this editor , you can even edit the result . in this editor , you can even edit the result . &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you with the compar@@ isons and assembling complete folder . this screenshot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder together :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and extends to the possibilities of active colour monitors . if you need to check this function , you will like this function . &quot;
&quot; differences in white signs and tab@@ ulators are visible . if the lines differ only in a certain number of white signs , one can see the summary on the summary in the column on the left . ( no hass@@ le more , when J@@ em@@ and the inhal@@ ation changes . ) &quot;
&quot; when a file is the same , and the other is different in a line , then the colour indicates which file is different . red color means that both files differ . &quot;
&quot; if all files are the same name but can be used in different folders , then you can simply make yourself the ti@@ p@@ par@@ work by writing only the file name of the first file . example : &quot;

&quot; opening dialog allows the manual collection of fil@@ ename , the selection above the file browser ( file ... ) or the output of an recently opened file from the file list . the opening dialog will not specify the third file ; if you have the entry for C empty , the analysis of the differences are performed with two files . &quot;
&quot; using the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you choose a folder , the compar@@ ing or mer@@ ging of folders will be selected , then used for B and C however a folder , then used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A in the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; if assembling is crossed , the input field is active and can be attached . however , it is not necessarily required , immediately a output file . you can also take this step later on saving . &quot;
the set @-@ button opens a dialog with settings . here you can define options before you start with the compar@@ ing / mer@@ ging .
&quot; sometimes you do not want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison begins then immediately . in opening dialog you must choose any files , you can simply complete the dialog with the break button . &quot;
you can also use drag and drop you : just drag a file from a file manager or select text from an editor and let it drop over a comparison window .
&quot; which thought is behind it ? sometimes contains a file e.g. several similar functions . if you want to find out how much these functions are , it would only have two corresponding files , they would have to download in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; load and then compare them . now you can simply copy the relevant sections simply to paste and then compare . &quot;
note : currently you can not drag nothing out &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the case of text into a comparison window will be supported .
warning : some editors interpre@@ t the hand @-@ hand and inser@@ ting text into another program as trigger and inser@@ ting ( instead of copying and inser@@ ting ) . in such a case your original data could be lost .
&quot; in the upper part of each text window , the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ ename and the on@@ set number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that windows C is optional . then a small relief window will display the complete name . ) &quot;
&quot; the three source windows are the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is Mag@@ enta . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed over the Settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; when a difference is detected , one can see in the color , which file diff@@ ers . if both files differ , the pre@@ set colour is particularly useful if you compare three files . that &apos;s in the next section ( collapse ) well . &quot;
&quot; links next to the text is the summar@@ ies column . if differences were found , the column shows the appropriate colour . in some programming languages , the colour is not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + for example , white characters are relevant only in strings and comments , relevant for the pre@@ processor and in a few , rare retail . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line , which separates the summar@@ ies column of the text , will be interrupted on the places where the respective source file has no lines . if the switch @-@ file is activated , the line is shown on the converted lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( among the compar@@ ative windows ) also has a info line with the wor@@ ding issue : , the fil@@ ename and &#91; change &#93; if you have dealt with the result . usually it contains the automatic merger already text , but often it contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! to all conflicts are resolved is the storing de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use the buttons spr@@ int to nights of the stem / un@@ solved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
&quot; if only two compar@@ ants can be used , each difference also has to be solved in the same time a conflict of manual . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the left mouse button in the column of the window , the group is marked with all the windows and the first line of the group will not be visible . ( this is also a jump in the position in the windows . ) This group is highlighted the current group . it will appear with the color back@@ color for current area , and each of the left will appear a black beams . &quot;
&quot; sometimes through automatic mer@@ ging or by manual be@@ works no more line stays in the group ; then it is displayed in those lines of the text ; then one line in the Qu@@ el@@ sets ; this text is not displayed in the final stored file , nor in a mark@@ er that you might copy and paste . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; however , appears in the clip@@ board , however , appears in the clip@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . go carefully with this feature . &quot;
note : if you choose the sources to ignore the options numbers or I@@ gn@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments are activated , changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters . &quot;
&quot; this navig@@ ates is mainly used with the image volume and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you use in one of the window , Si@@ w you can use the arrow buttons , just as you can also use it from other programs . the over@@ looks @-@ column can also be used by other programs . &quot;
in the eye window you can also use the other buttons to use . with the insert button you can switch between one and over@@ write mode . ( pre@@ set is the inser@@ tion mode . )
one click with the left mouse button in one of the summar@@ ies column synchron@@ izes the view of all windows on the top of each group ( as already in the section together and the ed@@ itable output window has been declared ) .
&quot; the toolbar contains seven buttons to navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ bottom down@@ wards ) or to the next / previous conflict ( roadmap pro@@ val ) or to the next / previous conflict . therefore , between solved and un@@ resolved conflicts must be differenti@@ ated between solved and un@@ resolved conflicts . &quot;
&quot; to copy the mark@@ ers to the clip@@ board , you need to copy the Copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or Str@@ g @-@ In@@ sert ) . if this option is activated , what keeps you activated , automatically insert in the clip@@ board and the manual copying . be with this option but you could add the contents of the clip@@ board . &quot;
&quot; dos@@ ing are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix variants are using a tick @-@ based system \ \ r \ . K@@ diff@@ 3 reserves the dos@@ ing of source files not with , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not using binary files . &quot;
the options and the list of the most recently used files will be automatically saved and restored at the next start . ( menu adju@@ sting - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 ... )
&quot; select a f@@ ont with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also displays scripts with vari@@ ab@@ ler width to choose from you , you should not use it . ) &quot;
&quot; if you activate this option , differences in cur@@ si@@ ver is displayed . if the chosen Scri@@ ptures do not support this representation doesn &apos;t happen at all . &quot;
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors could not be available in their pure form but would be shown again . on these systems the button pres@@ ets automatically poses an un@@ just color .
&quot; when this option is activated , the button of the tab@@ ulator button is inserted in the appropriate number of spaces . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator sign is inserted . &quot;
&quot; if you press your input or return , the proceeds of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; when this option is activated , each selection is automatically copied into the clip@@ board . the manual copy into the clip@@ board then . &quot;
you can choose which fork @-@ type you prefer to save . the pre@@ set value is the generally usual selection of the operating system used .
&quot; when entering files &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all completely identical lines can be ignored in the source files . only during this first step , white signs are not ignored . in this step , white signs are not ignored . also when mer@@ ging the white characters are not ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) store a re@@ agen@@ ched sign &apos; \ &apos; . usually ignored &amp; k@@ diff@@ ers &apos; \ &apos; . usually ignored &amp; k@@ diff@@ ers &apos; \ &apos; . if this option is activated , however , it may be activated with different sizes on the side @-@ side comparison . during the merger , this option must be disabled . in default this option is de@@ activated . &quot;
&quot; in preference to this option , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis numbers and associated signs ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are nonetheless indicated , but they are treated like white signs . &quot;
in default this option is disabled . changes in comments will be treated as changes in white characters .
&quot; intensive after even smaller differences . the option is enabled in preference . it is effectively with complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files . &quot;
&quot; in the automatic @-@ forwar@@ ding mode , this attitude determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next un@@ solved conflict will continue . &quot;
&quot; solving automatic all conflicts in white characters by using the chosen file as source . ( pre@@ set is useful , manual choice . if you need this only from time to time , then use the automatic selection also conflicts in numbers or comments if the options are ignore or i@@ gn@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments are activated . &quot;
these options are treated in chapter to scan folders and execute a combination . look for details under documentation to the directory comparison and co @-@ management .
&quot; when a file is saved and already an older version exists , then the original version exists the Suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if already exists such a back@@ up@@ file with the Suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , this will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
adap@@ ts the language of the user interface . the amend@@ ment of this option does not affect the currently running program . you must finish and re @-@ diff@@ use it . ( this option is active in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is shut down globally through the control center . )
the following en@@ coding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you choose this option is used for all entries the upper settings .
&quot; via the choices for the coding appears a short note , which is the local en@@ coding . ( this can not be changed here and has for you purely informal nature . ) &quot;
&quot; customize the file en@@ coding for source files . this affects how special marks are treated and interpreted . because the coding for each file is individually adjustable , even files can be compared with different coding and mer@@ ged . &quot;
&quot; if you have edited a file , you can specify which coding is to be used for storing . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre @-@ processing command , they might not be working with your co@@ dec . ( e.g. , your files could be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only be used with 8 @-@ bit ASCII character . ) With this option one can specify the coding of the output from pre @-@ processing command . &quot;
&quot; place this from , to supp@@ ress cross@@ ings of changes in white characters in text or over@@ view . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments when the options ignore or i@@ gn@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments are activated . ) &quot;
&quot; this selection is available only if you compare three files . in normal mode , all the differences are displayed in a coloured co@@ ed over@@ s column . but sometimes you might just want to see the differences between two of three files . according to a selection of A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; C is shown next to the normal nor a second over@@ place column with the required information . &quot;
sometimes you &apos;d like to use the available space on the screen rather for long lines . follow the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
&quot; the compar@@ ative window be assigned to each other or over@@ each other , this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . ) &quot;
&quot; sometimes you consider the differences and then decide to perform the files together . a simple click starts the mer@@ ging and uses the fil@@ ename of the latest source file as a pre@@ set name for the output file , then the name of the most recently used output file will be retained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , they will first commit to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command will be visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own preferences , which corresponds exactly to your requirements . you can use this function e.g. to cut dis@@ rup@@ tive parts or to correct the inspection . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , they are specified first to this external command . if the output of the command is specified . you can write your own preferences , which corresponds exactly to your requirements . each entry line must have a related issue . &quot;
&quot; the thought behind it is to facilitate the user more flexibility when dealing with the Di@@ ff results . but for this , an external program is needed , and most users don &apos;t want to program yourself . the good news is however , that in most cases sed sed or per@@ l completely suff@@ ice . &quot;
use this pre @-@ processing command for the input in large letters : sed &apos;s / \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
CV@@ S and other Ver@@ sion@@ control systems use some keywords to insert automatic written reference ( info : / c@@ vs / key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) . * \ \ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; while you experiment with sed , you might begin to understand it and maybe you like this regular expression even . you are very useful because there are many programs that are very similar things to support . &quot;
&quot; the Ig@@ nor@@ ing of numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for a further processing command for tick bit@@ . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 34@@ 56@@ 78@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &quot; each of the character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each match is replaced by nothing , so quasi . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you might want to perform several conditions at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions from one another . example : &quot;
instead of sed sed you can also need something else such as per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / Er@@ set / switch . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ \ ) needs per@@ l only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data according to the normal pre@@ processor is retained for the display and to the mer@@ ging . the further operations only change the data that can see the tick @-@ equ@@ als straight @-@ Al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus .
&quot; note : in rare cases when you use a normal Pre@@ processor , the tick @-@ dres@@ sers , the output of the normal Pre@@ percentage is as input . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function , the text changes or differences hidden , you cannot notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst circumstances . &quot;
many times have to edit programmers in a folder many files . for this reason you can compare with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder recur@@ sively compare and assem@@ ble .
... making a suggestion for each object to perform a proposal ; you can adjust the proposal before the start
... can sim@@ ulate the contrac@@ tion and demonstrates the sim@@ ulated changes without them really perform .
... &quot; guides selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 button ) , or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) , &quot;
this is very similar to the compar@@ ing and assembling of individual files . you only need to open folder on the command line or in the dialog file .
&quot; when three files will be mer@@ ged , folder will be used as base . if no target is specified , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; Ord@@ n@@ 3 as a destination folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not the mer@@ ging . to start the merger , you must select the menu item or press the F@@ 7 button . ( more details follow . ) &quot;
&quot; while reading the folder you will inform a small news window on current progress . if you break down scanning the folder , only the files are listed until then . &quot;
&quot; when scanning the folder is complete , displays &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ... &quot;
each file and a folder that was found during scan is shown here in a tree . you can choose an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure will normally be folded . you can click on a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the object or by clicking the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions all sub@@ directories and all sub@@ directories can be found in all sub@@ directories and all sub@@ directories .
&quot; if you double click on a file , the file comparison will be started and it appears as a compar@@ ative window . &quot;
the icon in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) again . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in different folders , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detailed window to the selected object . in such a case the interaction process can not be automatically selected . if the mer@@ ging process can be started again , you will be informed about problems of this kind . &quot;
&quot; as shown in the above picture , are used in the columns A / B / C the colours red , green , yellow , and black . &quot;
&quot; with identical entries , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different . &quot;
&quot; folder will be considered identical if their overall content is identical . then , folders also have the same color . with folders , the age is in@@ significant for its colour . &quot;
&quot; the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . the colors reflect the colours of a leaf again , which is only green , then yellow will be yellow , and later if it is old , red . &quot;
&quot; a and C identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B is not exists , the objective if it exists ) &quot;
... A and B identical but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , the objective if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , the objective if it exists ) &quot;
... A , B and C do not have the same type of file ( e.g. if A folder and B is a file ) : bug : contradi@@ ctory file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , the mer@@ ging can not run . &quot;
... A and B not have the same type of file ( e.g. if A folder and B is a file ) : bug : contradi@@ ctory file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , the mer@@ ging can not run . &quot;
&quot; the mode to synchron@@ ize is active , if only two folder and no explicit target folder were specified . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action is identical so that both files are identical . if for an entry ... &quot;
... A and B exist but not identical are : carry out and result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible file name for the output file only B ; directly after the contrac@@ tion &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
&quot; when two files will be mer@@ ged and the option re@@ w@@ rest@@ less file take place instead . if the files are different , but the date is identical . if the files are identical , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange such errors are not removed , the mer@@ ging of the folder can not be started . &quot;
&quot; while the mer@@ ging will run a file after another . she has been running a file after another , and according to other messages , when something un@@ expect@@ edly entered . if the mer@@ ging is finished , you should make a last review and see if the status is all right . &quot;
&quot; when compared with the dialog box , the file compar@@ ative method is chosen , K@@ diff@@ 3 further columns . these contain the number of un@@ solved , sol@@ der , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for occa@@ sional conflicts is only shown if three files compared or mer@@ ged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either merge the just selected entry ( file or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the candi@@ da@@ bility actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the mer@@ ging . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you do not have any target folder , then in the three @-@ folder assembling mode C as a target you will be chosen as a destination and used to synchron@@ ize A and / or B as a destination . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a destination folder , please check if all entries should be displayed in the target structure , also in the folder structure . check out these options to avoid un@@ ador@@ able surprises : &quot;
to bring all entries to match : choose directory menu / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the keyboard short@@ cut ) . to order only the current entry : choose the action of the current item or press F@@ 6 .
&quot; if by contradi@@ ctory data types still exist , a message appears to the faul@@ ty elements . you can then select a valid action . &quot;
&quot; if you run all entries , a dialogue window appears with the options lead , sim@@ ulating and break . &quot;
simply select if you want to see only what would happen to happen without which really changes will be done . you will then get a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then leads certain actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is necessary ( merge a single file ) then opens a mer@@ ging window ( note the screenshot ) .
&quot; if you are ready with a file , select again and press F@@ 7 . if you still have not saved , a corresponding dialog . then leads &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work will continue with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a bug solution , a message appears and detailed status information . at the end of the list you &apos;ll see some messages that will help you to choose the cause of the problem . if you choose the option to select another action for the entry or to resolve the problem in any other way before proceeding . &quot;
&quot; if some entries have been individually assembled , you notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; this entry ( in the current session ) and performs it at the later mer@@ ging of all entries . even if here the mer@@ ging was transferred or not saved . only if you change the merger action , these entries will be mer@@ ged again . &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 up ... ) now has a section called folder combination with these options :
only files that are available on the specified pattern are displayed in the elementary tree . separate Plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the pres@@ et@@ ting is * . folder must not correspond to this pattern .
Files and folder that correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the elementary tree . it can be given more than one pattern . valid space holder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . pres@@ et@@ ting is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
Files and folder that correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the elementary tree . it can be given more than one pattern . valid space holder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . pres@@ et@@ ting is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
igno@@ res files that may also be ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ matic files are ignored by CV@@ S . the great advantage is that this may be set out specific with a .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some fil@@ es@@ ystems have files a per@@ tin@@ ent attri@@ bute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems it marks a file as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files are displayed in the elementary tree or not . this option is switched in preference .
&quot; when left on files : when the option is switched on , symbo@@ lic short@@ cuts is compared . if the option is switched on , the files are compared to which the links show . this is de@@ activated in preference . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched on folders : if the option is switched on , the links like normal folder will be treated and recur@@ sively through . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not on possible re@@ searches will guide and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; rus@@ hes out . ) This option is out@@ dated in default . &quot;
&quot; performs a complete analysis of each file by and displays the statistics columns . ( the number of sol@@ ves , un@@ solved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The full analysis is s@@ lower than a simple binary analysis , and much s@@ lower when they are applied to files that does not contain any text . ( give a appropriate anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot;
&quot; when you compare big folder on a slow network , it may possibly be quicker , only the amend@@ ment of the file and the file size . however , this option is a certain level of security . please use this option in default . &quot;
&quot; similarly as confidential to the chan@@ gel@@ og . there is no real comparison , when they are identical in size . this may be equally useful when copying the amend@@ ment . please with caution . this option is cancelled in default . &quot;
activ@@ ating the synchron@@ ize mode when two files are compared and no target identi@@ fier was specified . in this mode the suggestions for mer@@ ging so selected that both files are identical . also the results of the mer@@ ging of files are stored in both folders . this option is out@@ dated in preference .
&quot; if there are differences , instead of the mer@@ ging the head of the newer file proposed as action . ( this is considered un@@ certain , because it is assumed the knowledge that the other file is not also changed . ) This option is out@@ dated in default . &quot;
&quot; if a file or folder will be replaced by another or deleted , then the original version will be ren@@ amed with the .@@ ori@@ g extension , then it will also affect the normal assembling of single files , not only the combination of a directory . this option is switched in preference . &quot;
&quot; usually , the folder @-@ together view is visible by the mer@@ ging of single files ; you can switch the window display with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want to switch the window window with the mouse , you can switch the window window on the window and switch off by changing between directory &amp; text window between the two views . &quot;
&quot; probably you prefer to compare a file either by double @-@ clicking . however , you can also run a corresponding menu item . you can also use a single file menu navigation menu . so once you save the result , the status will be done , and the file will not be mer@@ ged again if you start the folder . &quot;
&quot; this status works however lost , if you read the directory once again : directory menu : new to read &quot;
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO @-@ slaves . K@@ diff@@ 3 uses this for reading files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folders for opening which are based on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one to an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a comp@@ ressed archives with a local folder .
a URL has another syntax for local files and folders . some things should you consider :
&quot; a path can be relative . or .. contain . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolutely . &quot;
&quot; special marks must be m@@ ashed . ( # - &gt; % 23 , blank - &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named file / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes because of the fil@@ es@@ ystem on the server , sometimes through the used protocol . it follows a brief list of limitations : &quot;
&quot; or it can not be differenti@@ ated if a link is displayed on a file or folder . then a file is displayed as a link destination . ( FTP : , SF@@ TP : ) . &quot;
there is no possibility to edit authorization or change date . therefore , the per@@ missions or the adjustment of the original . ( note the option familiar to the size . ) ( This is only applicable on local files ) . &quot;
&quot; the main purpose of the main purpose is at present as the differences @-@ viewers in K@@ De@@ velop . K@@ De@@ velop will first start the built @-@ in differences . to launch K@@ diff@@ 3 , press right mouse button on the differences view and then select In K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; normally &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two full input files . if it is used as a part , takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file . &quot;
in Kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part . also note that this does not work if any of the original files exists . moreover it is un@@ reliable if the original files has changed since the patch file .
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports the compar@@ ing of two files , a very small toolbar and menu . the mer@@ ging or the compar@@ isons of folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode . &quot;
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diff@@ 2 ( now He@@ are it Comp@@ are ) there are already . moreover , the name K@@ diff@@ 3 already indicates that it may result together as the program diff@@ ers from the Di@@ ff @-@ Tool collection . &quot;
I use GPL programs already very long and have lear@@ nt a lot by learning into the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programmers who have taken this way or let him go .
&quot; you have compiled the program from sources and configure the configure script not the right pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in preference settings in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can not find the resources for the user interface ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white characters is different , these lines will be treated as identical ; if however , only a non @-@ white sign is treated , the line is considered not identical . if the sperm lines appear next to each other , this reason is of the case . &quot;
&quot; the editor will notice any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . this important information is needed , however , if the result is easily saved as text file and it is too much effort to design a separate file format that could store this information . &quot;
&quot; the effort for this was so far too large . you can recover a certain version always by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger quantities of text , another editor should be used . &quot;
after removing text suddenly lt ; no sr@@ c so@@ aking ; appeared and the text can &apos;t delete . what does this mean and how can it be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; used already many colors for the highlight of differences . even more flo@@ ating would be conf@@ using and lack the purpose . please use a different editor .
many good ideas and troub@@ les came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
&quot; to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later . &quot;
information on how to use K@@ diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of recent changes can be found at http : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ angel@@ og or in the file chan@@ gel@@ og in the Qu@@ ell package .
&quot; to compile &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on one system with &amp; k@@ de ; compile and install , use the following command in the basic folder of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution : &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE @-@ dir gives the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are uns@@ ure , you will find further details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file . &quot;
&quot; da &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake uses , you should not have any problems with comp@@ iling . nevertheless difficulties occur , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mail@@ ing lists . &quot;
&quot; cut ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Shift ) copies into the clip@@ board and delet@@ es the selected text . insert ( Str@@ g @-@ V or revers@@ al inser@@ ting ) adds the text from the clip@@ board to the current cursor position or replace the current mark . &quot;
&quot; only differences view : files that are identical in all folders appear not appear in the folder structure , and consequently not in the target folder . &quot;
( in the current program version you must search for changes to these options the folder with the function actu@@ alize new . )
&quot; only entries are shown to show the differences . this also performs that identical files in mer@@ ging will not already exist in the target folder . if the destination folder does not already exist , they are missing in a later program version . ( the behavior will be ab@@ out@@ dated in a later program version . ) This option is switched in default . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons to choose the source with the cap@@ tion A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be displayed in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , you will click on the button according to the button . &quot;
in default this option is disabled . under@@ scores in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white signs .
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini @-@ show of all virtual des@@ ktops . it is quite handy to change the current programs at working spaces , change their size or move it . it works inside both working space and several . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ ktops , as well as the applications running simultaneously . the applications can be selected and even moves on the desktop and to another . &quot;
&quot; with the middle mouse button , window can be moved within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager . the movement is possible both within a single desktop and other des@@ ktops . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button will be cli@@ cked on : if on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; then click on the context menu , the context menu has only the two entries . &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window on the full size of the desktop . appears only if on a application has been cli@@ cked .
&quot; sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . appears , only if on an application was then cli@@ cked . &quot;
&quot; if this section is marked , window can be moved within the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other working areas . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , are displayed in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the names of virtual work areas is displayed . &quot;
&quot; let this field lets you view the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the numbers of virtual working spaces display . it is compiled together with name , the names with Or@@ din@@ al@@ pay is provided , &amp; eg ; 1 . working space . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , the running programs as small window in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; displayed . otherwise , only the empty spaces are displayed to enable their selection . &quot;
here is the view of the program window selected . simply shows simple rect@@ angle with the windows of the program window . symbol shows the window with its standard symbol and pixels shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is recommended only for very fast systems .
&quot; here is the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; -@@ main window be determined : classic lets &amp; c@@ p@@ ager are known , as made of p@@ ager applications in some other Wind@@ ow@@ es ; wa@@ agre@@ ke shows all virtual des@@ ktops in a horizontal and vertical range , which is very good for displaying lateral on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ® can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager Mini@@ program in the Control System . it has the advantage that he can display in size , the windows as symbols or with its content and move it . &quot;
click the right mouse button inside of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and following selecting the switch sel@@ ects ... makes the dialog settings appear .
&quot; at the moment , this cannot be changed in dialogue settings . however , you can manually do this manually : &quot;
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ e.@@ c with any text editor like e.g. &amp; ke@@ dit ; or VI . if you don &apos;t have any writing to the file , you need to register as a user root or opt @-@ in to your system administrator . in this file you must enter the key wind@@ ow@@ Transpar@@ ent@@ mode and add value to it . possible values are : &quot;
&quot; da &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package base is , you need a functional installation of the K@@ DE basic package . &quot;

&quot; &amp; km@@ ag ; is a screen shot . you can view with &amp; km@@ ag ; a part of the screen , so as if you &apos;re reading a magni@@ fier for small printed or the exact watch of a photo . this documentation is a full manual for the use of &amp; km@@ ag . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ag ; is a very powerful application , which is constantly enhanced by new functions . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance machines . &quot;
&quot; if you start &amp; km@@ ag ; the main window of &amp; km@@ ag ; displays the enlarged area of the screen . in the following , this window appears as a larger window . in the following , this window appears as a larger window , is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as the selection window . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting of enlarged &amp; km@@ ag ; the area around the mouse po@@ inter as a moving magni@@ fier . alternatively you can establish a selected screen in the larger window ( drop mode ) or the surrounding area of the mouse cursor on the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left side of the screen ) . &quot;
&quot; would you like to avoid that the mouse @-@ cursor in the enlarged window will be displayed , choose the setting mouse po@@ inter . please note that is not able to recognize the form of the mouse cursor ; this is always the default one ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse po@@ inter . &quot;
&quot; in the selection mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow keys and mouth keys and change its size . this can be done in the following way : &quot;
&quot; move the mouse @-@ cursor in the larger window and keep the left mouse button pressed , so you can move the content of the larger window and move it . this also goes with the arrow keys . &quot;
&quot; if you additionally press the &amp; Shift ; taste or the &amp; M@@ MB ; use , you can move the drop window . &quot;
with this combination you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the selection window will be firm and only the lower right corner is moving .
&quot; includes a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer to insert in a file to insert in the clip@@ board ( to add it later into other applications ) , the picture turn and much more . &quot;
starts the update of the display . the stopping the update brings that the needed CPU @-@ time goes against 0 .
&quot; choose the localization rate ( Very low , straight@@ ing , means , high ) . the higher the actu@@ alization rate , the more CPU @-@ time is required . &quot;
in this mode a selection window will be displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&quot; &amp; km@@ ag ; used automatically your submitted short @-@ command for storing files , opening a new window , prints , Ne@@ ul@@ adas ( with the kno@@ b document again invite you in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ larger and cr@@ ushing &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; it is also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; it is a screenshot of the screen . you can use an area of the screen , so as if you use a magni@@ fier to view the small print in a newspaper or photo . this application is for various people of use : from research or artists to the designer or visual han@@ dic@@ apped . &quot;
&quot; extensive user documentation can be found with help : / km@@ ag ( give either this URL to the address bar of &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or , one or start the help@@ center help : / km@@ ag ) . &quot;

&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates one mouse @-@ click , as soon as the mouse po@@ inter a while on the same point . it is meant to help people who suffer the R@@ SI syndrome ( re@@ peti@@ tive ) which each mouse @-@ click pain is prepared . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates one mouse @-@ click , as soon as the mouse po@@ inter a while on the same point . it &apos;s meant to help people who em@@ ulate the re@@ peti@@ tive of the jury ( R@@ SI ) and which each mouse @-@ click pain is also prepared . moreover , it does not require a little exercise . &quot;
&quot; you can handle any pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps to use so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you may also suffer from the blo@@ cking of your computer . unfortunately , you suffer a doctor if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; to get it clear : even if &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pain helps , who are caused by clicking with the mouse , it is against pain@@ s who is caused by the Be@@ es of the mouse , us@@ eless . and as with all the ergonomic tools : the result can be different for each different . &quot;
&quot; the use of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and guides one mouse @-@ click , once you break the motion shortly . &quot;
&quot; if the intelligent re@@ loc@@ ates is active , makes &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break after it has executed the mouse button . in this way , you can run the drag button of mouse button . in this way , you can run the drag@@ ging of mouse button . this smart t@@ int requires a little exercise , but you get used to get used quickly . &quot;
&quot; this distor@@ tion must be hidden after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; one mouse @-@ click . &quot;
&quot; is smart moving switched on , the turning point is stopped ( 1 / 10 s ) active . here the time is shut down , the &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; according to the descent of the mouse button waiting before it leaves the mouse button again , if we don &apos;t use it because of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ z@@ et@@ ool ; now this function is activated , followed by a break , followed by a break , followed by a break , one click with the right mouse button . a slow drive to the left and back , followed by a break , one click with the right mouse button . a long @-@ click with the right mouse button . a long @-@ click with the right mouse button is stored , if &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time will be started , but they can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; if the sound is del@@ ayed , you can move &amp; k@@ de ; then click on Sound &amp; Multimedia , choose the reaction time and here the Rider Sound Pu@@ ffer , you can set to a lower value to cut the response times . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is marked , &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; start with each start by &amp; k@@ de ; it is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; available for GNO@@ ME or other window facilities , please click the respective documentation to find out how to automatically start a program . &quot;
&quot; sets all settings back to the values that were adjusted when opening the dialogue , you have already pushed the button below to turn the settings according to the last handle of bonds . &quot;
&quot; best use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first to start with pres@@ ets . in particular , the smart t@@ int you should start off first . if you then hit the automatic mouse button , you can move later to the smart move . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; in case of sounds . &quot;
&quot; first , you should be aware of which places one mouse @-@ click without effect stays : the Click on the neutral components of windows or on places in the browser window , which does not represent a link . you can park the mouse on such places until you want to use it again . &quot;
&quot; if your mouse p@@ elt , you should puri@@ fy your mouse . this is normally quite simple . the trick allows you to puri@@ fy not just the mouse ball , but also the roles that comes with the mouse ball in touch . &quot;
&quot; first , you must step out the mouse ball . how this happens , is different from mouse to mouse . however , it should be quickly clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have the ball away , you would have to see the roles . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . the dirt and the dirt , you can easily walk with a flat blade or the finger . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations , the operating system breaks down the execution of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you have just begun a failure . if you &apos;re in this case the intelligent move , means that &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the surgery can no longer terminate through the slogan of the mouse button . &quot;
this happens if you use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to use a window to window and move a window .
the solution to this problem exists that you simply execute a mouse @-@ click . this is the status of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; return and you can continue as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; further mouse clicks and puts the cursor to another place . &quot;
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cursor to the cursor where you don &apos;t want to place it . however , you can &apos;t want to carry out the mouse on a neutral area of desktop , if you don &apos;t want to cause it . safe zones for the mouse po@@ inter are wi@@ ped out . safe zones for the mouse @-@ cursor are &amp; win ; the gray areas around the toolbar and menus and the cover line of windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the smart understanding , but I do not add it to edit . &quot;
&quot; the smart t@@ oss is an advanced function of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes time to copy it to this way , to copy it to the clip@@ board or to re @-@ insert any other action where you &apos;ll probably want to move your mouse to mouse button . but here are some advice on this : &quot;
&quot; do not use the smart t@@ oss not , if you just start to start &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; add text instead : run the mouse button at the bottom of the text , while you move the mouse po@@ inter to the other end of the text and once again the mouse button . &quot;
&quot; use the audi@@ ble mouse @-@ click . this way , every time you play a sound like a mouse @-@ click . so you know exactly when the intelligent adju@@ sting time begins . later you can use the intelligent re@@ loc@@ ating even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . however , it requires some exercise . &quot;
to use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window ; this should be the case in most cases .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system features a sound card and speaker and that is accurate .
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the mouse button is del@@ ayed as soon as the mouse po@@ inter . this program was developed for people who suffer the R@@ SI syndrome and which the beg@@ inner of the Mau@@ sta@@ sten pain is prepared . &quot;

&quot; &amp; km@@ outh ; is a program , with which st@@ um@@ b user can talk their computer for themselves . &quot;
&quot; with the program &amp; km@@ outh ; you can let the computer talk the computer for themselves . the user can choose from a list of the conversation , which should be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; on the first page of the wizard ( left screen photo ) , enter the command that will be used later for the language version of text . further details can be found in the description of the board dial@@ . &quot;
on the second side you can choose the standard text box . from the text@@ box you can often choose some passages without having to tap without them . the passages can of course be edited .
&quot; on the third side ( right screen photo ) you determine the dictionary for the voc@@ abulary . &amp; km@@ outh ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words . additionally , you can get the word@@ list with a Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words into the voc@@ abulary . &quot;
the main window of &amp; km@@ outh ; is clear and essentially contains a input field for the ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ ment of your propositions ( the lower white field in the screenshot ) and a per@@ enni@@ al memory of the already spoken propositions ( the upper white field in the screenshot ) .
&quot; if you have commemor@@ ate yourself , you can enter in the input field the propositions you want to hear . each se@@ di@@ ous proposition is attached to the lead @-@ memory . you can select from it , which should be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; with the menu entry settings : km@@ outh ; Set up ... open up the cat@@ ching dialog by &amp; km@@ outh ; . this dialog contains two card @-@ cards , language @-@ language and settings , the page of voc@@ als , as well as the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service . &quot;
&quot; in the box of the card @-@ card language , enter the command to call the language generators . in the drop @-@ field you place the character coding , with the text will be passed on to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ outh ; knows two types to pass the text . select the box , if the text should be handed down as default to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; if the An@@ kreu@@ z is not selected , the text will be distributed as parameters . you can use the following plac@@ ements : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command to the language of your language generator will depend on your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation for your language generator . examples for this you will find in the app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; with as possible as voice service we use &amp; km@@ outh ; as the first try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if this is successful , the other settings will be available on this page . the choice of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection of action , following the selection of a text Passage you determine which action is triggered by the keyboard short@@ cut or by selecting a text Passage in the menu text box or in the bar for text files . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of so@@ fort , the selected text cycle is inserted directly and in addition to the file memory . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage is first entered into the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second selection of tracks of the processing window for text box , you can specify if the text box can be automatically saved when closing the processing window automatically . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of text files and save the book . if you choose any changes , the text box will not be saved . select the text box , will be saved &amp; km@@ outh ; ask if the text@@ box will be saved . &quot;
the page Wor@@ ter@@ ation contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the voc@@ abulary . in the main window next to the input field displays &amp; km@@ outh ; a drop @-@ down menu appears when this list contains more than a dictionary . with this selection box you can choose the currently used dictionary for voc@@ abulary .
&quot; with the buttons on the right side , you can delete or add the order of books or export them into a file . below the list can set you in the input field name and in the selection box the language for the dictionary . &quot;
select the language ; &amp; km@@ outh ; reads out the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the Frequ@@ ency of the individual words is simply determined by the count of occurrence . additionally you can insert the word@@ list with a Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary to add only the written words into the new dictionary .
&quot; with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; km@@ outh ; ask then , which dic@@ tion@@ aries are mer@@ ged and how it should be weight@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; with this option you put a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; km@@ outh ; new entered words automatically in the dictionary , create a dictionary with your voc@@ abulary . &quot;
the main area of the window to the processing of text files is divided . in the upper part the text@@ book books is represented as tree structure .
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected item . if you have selected a text@@ box , you can change the text@@ box or associated keyboard short@@ cut . if you have selected a text box , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; actions like new text passages or books add or selected text passages and books can be delete either via the menu bar , in the toolbar or via a pop@@ up menu . &quot;
the sequence of text files or text @-@ passages you can change by drag@@ ging with the mouse to the new spot or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; -@@ key change .
&quot; the chosen text is cut out and copied into the clip@@ board . if the box is selected , this is used , otherwise the selected areas of the pan@@ cre@@ as is used . &quot;
&quot; the chosen text is copied into the clip@@ board . if the item is selected in the input field , it is used to do otherwise the selected areas of the pan@@ cre@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the currently active set is spoken . if text is located in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected propositions of the pan@@ cre@@ as . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is crossed , a movable toolbar for frequently used commands , is displayed by default via the editing window directly under the menu bar . by mouse click on the hand @-@ hand side and drag@@ ging the toolbar can be moved to another place . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is crossed , a narrow bar in the lower part of the main window with notes on the condition of &amp; km@@ outh ; indicated if not crossed , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; this menu entry is crossed , is displayed a movable bar for text @-@ passages with entries . the bar is default via the processing window directly under the toolbar side and drag@@ ging the toolbar can be moved to another place . &quot;
probably you have the command for voice output not correct or not complete . open settings of km@@ outh ; Set up ... to open the page General settings and enter the command for voice output language . ( see Settings dialog for language syn@@ thesizer to further details . )
&quot; Festival is a language @-@ edition system of the University Edinburgh . currently , only English , Spanish and Wel@@ fare is supported . the license allows you to use the festival free of charge and dis@@ semin@@ ate no restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting the language output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the folder / usr / local / festival . the command to voice output is then : &quot;
Free@@ T@@ TS is a in &amp; Java ; written language generator . currently he only supports the English language . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and dis@@ semin@@ ate without restrictions .
&quot; in order to show an example of the command line for setting up language output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the folder / usr / local / fre@@ et . language is then possible with one of the three following command lines : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option must be printed as default . ( this is the recommended example for the use of Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
&quot; M@@ BRO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of Ph@@ on@@ emen in a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to use the text in Ph@@ on@@ eme . the license allows you to use M@@ BRO@@ LA for non commercial and non @-@ commercial applications . &quot;
&quot; in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text in Ph@@ on@@ eme for M@@ BRO@@ LA under the assumption that H@@ adi@@ fax and M@@ BRO@@ LA in / usr / local / ha@@ di@@ fax and / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la are installed . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax liked the last character of the text , so that an additional sign is required . the full command is therefore more costly than in the other examples : &quot;
&quot; ( cat - ; echo &quot; &quot; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la / / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la / / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la / / usr / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v &quot;
all parts of the command must be written into one line . the option to send data as default .
&quot; the voice @-@ dem@@ on by &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language service , which provides a standard interface for language output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice @-@ output systems . &quot;
&quot; since the attitude of the speech is done only in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you must use only as possible as language service in &amp; km@@ outh ; adjust . &quot;
&quot; to adjust the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which appears in the dialog dialog by &amp; km@@ outh ; appears if K@@ TT@@ SD installed . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; km@@ outh ; you need to use a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; km@@ outh ; needs about 15 MB memory ( and additionally storage for the language generator ) , but depends on the individual from your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ outh ; is an application with the people that can not speak , text by the computer can be found . there will be a list already saved phrases that the user can always re @-@ release again . &quot;
note that &amp; km@@ outh ; no voice syn@@ thesizer contains . on the machine needs to be a language syn@@ thesizer .

&quot; marriage you &amp; kt@@ on ; use , you must install program Speech disp@@ at@@ cher and set correctly . see also &quot;
&quot; when the first start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr or as long as yet no speaker are set up , the card card speaker is indicated . see also . if you have at least one speaker , the card card is shown in general . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS @-@ Syn@@ thesizer provide various languages and voices , so also different male or female , or such that is described in volume or speed . you can also create multiple variants for a syn@@ thesizer , voice , gender , volume and speed is used as speaker . you should at least one speaker before you are using the program speed @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise use the default speakers . &quot;
different speaker for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable with several printing presses for the same printer .
&quot; if you click on the card @-@ card speaker in kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr , the card card speaker is displayed . this will also be automatically displayed if you are starting t@@ sm@@ gr and yet no speaker is set up . &quot;
all already furnished speakers appear in this list . the preferred spokes@@ man appear above in the list . the top speakers will be used for voice output if an application is no speaker .
&quot; click on the list with a mouse @-@ click on the list , and click on these button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;

&quot; filter for the drawing board provide a good opportunity in &amp; kt@@ oria ; incorrect or faul@@ ted messages , is a good example . you remove the tags is sent and b from the news , send the mail , and also the expression / local / In@@ box , since this in most cases can be accepted as provided . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced skills of &amp; kt@@ oria ; . for normal work with &amp; kt@@ oria ; filter is not required .
&quot; in Fil@@ ters , text is edited , before he is sent to the program Speech disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving the pron@@ unci@@ ation of speech or abbreviations to select a matching language and speaker , or to deal with certain lack of language syn@@ thesi@@ zers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the working method of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; Speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; diff@@ ers from four types of texts . &quot;
&quot; the output of Screen Re@@ a@@ ders has the highest priority . it will be submitted to all other orders and holds this orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the orders are continued again . &quot;
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news such as one ; processor is too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are continued after the warning of warning .
&quot; News have the nearest ank@@ le priority . a message interru@@ pts normal text . &amp; km@@ outh ; is an example of an application that can be used . during you &amp; win ; have a long text on a website , you can move with &amp; km@@ outh ; someone lets you just enter the room . &amp; k@@ issing are also news . read about it . &quot;
&quot; the rest are simple text @-@ applications . each order you encounter from the card card orders , is a text order . K@@ S@@ ay@@ it is an example of a applications that have been used by text messages . text messages are intended for the issue of prolon@@ ged texts , which have no particular ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; all four entries are processed in queu@@ e , with the exception of the output of screen re@@ aders . if an application will send the issue of screen re@@ aders , while &amp; kt@@ oria ; just such a pre@@ reads , this issue will stop and ended . &quot;
&quot; first you need to know that filter will never be applied to the output of screen represent@@ ations . you will be applied to normal warnings , messages and text messages as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News . &quot;
filter by edit the text and give it further to the next filter . at the moment there are three types of filters .
filters are running as modules . in the future there are still further types of filters .
&quot; drawing parts of a text by other text . to indicate the parts of a text , you can specify either as words or as regular expres@@ sions . &amp; kt@@ on ; will allow you to set forth as words or as regular expression . &amp; nbsp ; is possible with pre @-@ defined drawing boxes , such as : - ) by text or for the reform@@ atting of messages . or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better compreh@@ en@@ sible form . &quot;
&amp; XML ; -@@ Re@@ former use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert a format to another format .
&quot; with speaker options , you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program , sent the text to &amp; kt@@ on . if you have sent a female voice for example on the card card speaker , you can release text by K@@ DE news . &quot;
&quot; each of these different filters has sel@@ ectable rules , which he is applied to a voice output . if the filter occurs that its rules doesn &apos;t exist , he gives the text unchanged at the next filter . &quot;
&quot; if a text@@ book is sent a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ notification , it is processed by all the activated filters which is set up on the page below . the processing proceeds by the filter is displayed in the list from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of the furnished normal filters . if a filter does not be crossed , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed in line according to bottom . &quot;
click here to add a new filter . select the type of filter and it will be displayed on the following catalogues .
&quot; for the establishment of character fittings , you must enter a list of words or regular equi@@ pping as compar@@ ative replacement . these patterns will be changed in the text , then the text will not be changed for the corresponding replacement text . &quot;
&quot; enter your filter for your filter . you can choose any name for your filter , it must only be different from the name of the other filters . &quot;
this is the list of words and regular phrases . the filter compar@@ es the text with the string chains in the column agreement and replace it in accordance with the string drop out of the column . the list is shown in the order from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or the regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular excer@@ pts from a file to save the current list or file . download a list from a file , the entries are app@@ ended to the available list . &quot;
&quot; here is a language entered here , the filter is only applied if the speaker for the text@@ book is listed here . click on the button to show a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages when you click the mouse click the &amp; C@@ trl key . &quot;
&quot; here is a value included , the filter is only applied if the text is used by one of the specified applications . you can type multiple programs separated by Kom@@ mat@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
the application ID course you get with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; D@@ bus ; -@@ Num@@ bers you have to leave . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID @-@ 34@@ 32 shows you may only enter .
&quot; the drawing board filter is used only then to the text when all the conditions are used with an entry in the box panel , if it coinci@@ de . are all input fields empty , the filter is applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; when compared to words , the string filters be used in the form \ \ s word \ \ . the words must therefore be confin@@ ed by default ( spaces ) . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will find no manual for writing regular expression . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; expres@@ sions &amp; # 160 ; expres@@ sions can be found in the G@@ deu@@ ti@@ ls package . &quot;
&amp; XML ; -@@ Re@@ former translate &amp; XML ; using X@@ SL@@ T files from a format to another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3C standard for such conver@@ sions . it can only be used on well @-@ shaped XML . the auxiliary program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the ambient variable P@@ AT@@ H ranges also x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; using the spokes@@ person optionally , you can send texts to a particular speaker , which is set up on the card card speaker , or to a speaker with specific properties . you can for example set the lyrics of a female voice should be read . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; kt@@ on ; a text to the filter indicates , it is looking for an speaker for the text . the speaker is chosen by the speaker properties that the program is selected , and the characteristics of the speaker card speaker . with the spokes@@ person optionally , you can over@@ write the chosen spokes@@ person . &quot;
&quot; if a value is entered here , the filter is applied here , the filter is applied to your system of &amp; k@@ de ; Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expres@@ sions installed , you can get this with one click on the button to get help from entering . &quot;
&quot; to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , begin the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; here are the properties of the desired speaker . if the text meets the above filter conditions , the speaker is selected , the speaker is selected to indicate the desired requirements . click on the button right to view the dialog boxes . &quot;
use these buttons to save your phone settings or delete all settings .
&quot; the spokes@@ person optionally , is used only then to the text when all the conditions apply with an entry in the box , apply if any need to apply . you must enter at least one condition . &quot;
&quot; language @-@ output API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with the programmer can l@@ end their applications T@@ TS @-@ skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD about &amp; D@@ bus ; &quot;
the K@@ TT@@ SD Module API with the language syn@@ thesizer to K@@ TT@@ SD added to that so &amp; kt@@ am ; this syn@@ thesizer can use .
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ bus ; -@@ interface to the language output API from &amp; k@@ de ; . complete documentation for both AP@@ Is you will find on the k@@ de ; Acc@@ essi@@ bility website ( http : / / accessi@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
application calls for language services via the &amp; D@@ bus ; -@@ interface between &amp; k@@ de ; from the program kt@@ d via the object K@@ Speech .
&quot; in doing so , text of the text to the entry and option is a language code like &amp; eg ; s , de &amp; etc &quot;
there are even more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands give you

none of the named language syn@@ thesizer supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
&quot; I have set the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ Re@@ formed filter , but when using the module for festival , web pages are not read . &quot;
&quot; due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 , you need to install the ( male British ) voice of Rab _ di@@ phone , so that SA@@ B@@ LE operates at all . you don &apos;t have to do it if you don &apos;t have this voice to use the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program and to find the ambient variable P@@ AT@@ H . &quot;
&quot; certain signs or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks seem to cause errors in syn@@ thesizer , so all propositions will be over@@ thrown or only gib@@ ber@@ ish . what can I do against it ? &quot;
&quot; first , make sure that the option character en@@ coding is set to the right value for the corresponding language . there are problems with certain signs or words , these may be fixed by a character device filter . &quot;

the program &quot; Speech @-@ D@@ isp@@ at@@ cher &quot; uses a adapt@@ able module @-@ architecture for voice syn@@ thesizer . if you want to extend the development of another syn@@ thesi@@ zers to connect to the development team .
&quot; the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter , but is not necessarily necessary . Debian user can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . &quot;
&quot; to compile and compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including the packages of the deli@@ bs and the mechanical files for the program &quot; Speech disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you have downloaded the source text from th@@ kt@@ on ; from the source code , refer to the source file or downloaded for each night currently ordered items , translate and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you use &amp; kt@@ on , please check out whether speech disp@@ at@@ cher correctly works with your voice syn@@ thesizer . for this you can use the Sh@@ ell@@ skri@@ pt sp@@ d @-@ conf@@ . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ on ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ on ; which is the first version of Speech disp@@ at@@ cher . the program ct@@ ed@@ s@@ gr is supposed to be further developed , that the setup of speech disp@@ at@@ cher is not possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed . &quot;
a long text will be dis@@ assembled in individual sent@@ ences . the user can re@@ boot at or de@@ fl@@ ake to repeat the output or break .
&quot; if an application has text to &amp; kt@@ on ; moreover , it can indicate the properties of the preferred speaker for the output . thus , it can be used for example a female English speaker . if you want to know more about such a female speaking speaker . if you want to know more about how &amp; kt@@ oria ; one speaker will be chosen , you will see in . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the card speaker speakers to add or click on the list below , the card @-@ card speaker is displayed . as an example , the box set is shown for Festival Interactive . details of the modules can be found under . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path is contained in P@@ AT@@ H , you must enter only festival . &quot;
&quot; choose the drawing code for text , which is passed to Festival . for voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts ; known , this setting will be done automatically . generally speaking , that Western languages ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 use , eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak , ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these sli@@ ders , you make volume , microphone speed and pitch @-@ height of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some regul@@ ator and this gray will not be displayed , the voice chosen the voice you choose . &quot;
&quot; some voices such as multi @-@ Sy@@ n voices require multiple seconds to be loaded because of their size , these voices will already be loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that ( with large memory consumption ) the first set is faster syn@@ thesi@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; if this cri@@ cket can not be selected , you have not yet set an speaker ( or forget to click ) . &quot;
&quot; if this section is marked , when starting the kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr program is visible , the program window appears in the system section . otherwise , after starting the icon is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to view the program window . &quot;
&quot; is this cross @-@ section marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr does not even run it appears in the system range , as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . thus , you have the possibility to address the entry or to control it . &quot;
&quot; here are all orders performed in queu@@ e , along with the application that has adjusted the order , the number of propositions and the straight proposition . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the card card speaker . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series you can pick up sat@@ ise in the order that is selected in the list below , pre@@ - or back . ( but not every order consists of several movements ) . &quot;
&quot; by clicking OK , all changes of the settings are taken ( also on the other card @-@ cards ) and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is comp@@ uted to the icon in the system section . then click on this icon to see the program window again . &quot;
&quot; if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Co@@ de , click on the card card audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; here are only text @-@ applications listed and managed . issues of screen records , warnings and messages are not displayed . &quot;
&quot; here you can choose the type of audio output . if a component can not be selected , it was compiled ; either without support for the corresponding audi@@ om@@ o@@ dul or &amp; kt@@ ts ; the necessary libraries can not load . &quot;
&quot; if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Co@@ de are used for the audio output , select here the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you need to install at least one module , select the PC@@ M @-@ device . see also &quot;
&quot; Set the speaker speed here . 50@@ ,000 % is equivalent to about half and 200@@ v . % about the double normal microphone speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed . &quot;
click An@@ turn to take the new settings for the running &amp; kt@@ on ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules which are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you need to find out which device is working with you . in doubt you choose standard .
&quot; on this card card , you can setup special actions that will always be executed when the text message is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processed four types of language contracts : &quot;
&quot; the output of Screen Re@@ a@@ ders has the highest priority . it will be submitted to all other orders and holds this orders . after the output of the screen readers have been read , the orders are recorded again . &quot;
warnings have priority next priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is too hot reserved . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are continued after the entry of warning .
&quot; News have the next priority . a message interru@@ pts normal text . &amp; km@@ outh ; is an example of an application , the news appe@@ als . if you are doing a long text on a website , you can enjoy with &amp; km@@ outh ; nevertheless someone welcome you to go straight to the room . &quot;
&quot; if a text order will be interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen Re@@ aders , adds &amp; kt@@ on ; the Audio@@ Output into the queu@@ e . &quot;
&quot; this audio file will always be played if a normal text order will be interrupted . if both introductory sound and introductory message is active , the introductory sound is played before the introductory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this card card apply only for normal text messages . for messages , warnings and the issues of screen represent@@ ations are no special promotions if they will be interrupted by a message with higher priority . &quot;
&quot; to let with &amp; kt@@ oria ; K@@ Noti@@ fy messages can be used , start t@@ sm@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and click notifications . the card card al@@ erts appear . &quot;
&quot; mark this folder in order to switch the entry of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Ben@@ ach@@ ments to turn off . if this setting is not marked , the remaining settings are de@@ activated and cri@@ b ; do not read al@@ erts . &quot;
&quot; this setting is marked , al@@ erts when a sound is cancelled , by &amp; kt@@ oria ; not read . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add events to the list or delete it . if you click on the button Add a dialog , where you can select the application and event you want to add to the list . &quot;
&quot; this event reads the message before , the &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; be sent , if someone is first mentioned in an IR@@ C message . &quot;
&quot; all events , for which in the list is nothing else stated by &amp; kt@@ on ; ignored . &quot;
use this selection field to define what &amp; kt@@ am ; do should be when an event meets . you have the following choices :
&quot; if you have selected users with the defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ ements : &quot;
&quot; you can enter the properties of the desired speaker . default select the speaker , which is displayed in the list on the card card speaker as the top story . see also . &quot;
&quot; note that there are three levels for events . if a particular event is defined for events . otherwise , this action will be executed for any other events of the specific application . as the last option comes the action for wearing , which was specified under standard ( all other events ) . &quot;
&quot; the event All notifications for the application standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list , for this , you can specify the messages as follows : &quot;
&quot; use the button save to save the settings for the notifications in a file . use the button to load stored settings from a file . if you want to start with an empty list , click Delete . all entries except all Ben@@ ach@@ ments will be deleted . &quot;
&quot; the Speech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3C standard to highlight text for the control of voices , the speaker speed , the loud@@ speaker , the speaker , the speaker , the voice and pitch . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , a further W@@ 3C standard . &quot;
currently &amp; ct@@ ose ; SS@@ ML only partly and only in the basic functions . the following limitations are available :
&quot; you need to install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tish male ) because this is the default , the festival is used in the output of SS@@ ML . &quot;
&quot; if the settings for speed or audi@@ ences in the Festival configuration dialog does not have to 100@@ g % , SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ ot@@ on . &quot;
&lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; en@@ coding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &lt; ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE / TR / Speech
&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and pro@@ posi@@ tional filter ( SD@@ B filter ) . SB@@ Ds sub@@ divided , not the whole text order , since only the first set has been syn@@ thesi@@ zed , not the whole text order . thus , you can also jump or stop and break down , even if the language syn@@ thesizer it is not supported directly . &quot;
&quot; here you can see the set @-@ bound@@ less filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ on ; you can change its settings or add additional stat@@ utes filter , its beginnings will be out of it . &quot;
&quot; the easi@@ est way to try and check the setup of the talk choice . place on the card select orders , which speaker &amp; kt@@ oria ; select the selection of the Spe@@ aker settings . for this , you must of course have more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; then faster with the entry can start , since only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block what can last very long . &quot;
&quot; you can then stop text messages on the card card orders or break up , even if the language syn@@ thesizer do not support this function . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons the normal set @-@ proof@@ ing filter is automatically set up , if you start t@@ sm@@ gr for the first time . he can not be switched off , just away . change nothing at this filter , unless you know what you do . &quot;
Set @-@ limit@@ ing filter compare text with a regular expression for pro@@ posi@@ tional and add a sp@@ ul@@ atory sign ( dec@@ imal number ( dec@@ imal characters automatically removed from the text ) . note that the default sentence filter is re@@ tains to the character .
&quot; SB@@ D filters will never be applied to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News ( cold ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen Re@@ aders . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed from understanding the normal proposition , you can insert it again by using the file called &quot; sb@@ dr@@ c &quot; file standard _ sb@@ dr@@ c . &quot;
&quot; on the card card , you can over@@ write the microphone settings for the application . the card card is shown if &quot;
use of the standard Spe@@ aker ( the top on the card card speaker ) . in other words : there are no speaker properties set .
&quot; use of the most suitable speaker , which shows all properties of a furnished spokes@@ person . if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker . if you choose the settings of the speaker . otherwise , select &amp; kt@@ on ; for the spokes@@ man that corresponds to the same properties originally . &quot;
select the method for entering the desired intercom properties by clicking on one of the drop @-@ heads .
&quot; choose the properties of the desired speaker . if this property does not play a role , do not give anything . &quot;
select this folder if the property is priority to other properties . you can also use multiple mark@@ ers here .
&quot; because the language is a critical factor when processing the output is , this is always being treated as pre@@ ran@@ ked property . they will be the only case where you may wish to specify the attri@@ bute language , if you know that a certain application is sent a text in another language than that in the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to use all properties in the field of speaker , which corresponds to the test below , click on the drop @-@ board default , and then use to speaker , who corresponds to the test below . &quot;
in this case 0 is available for the last text order in queu@@ e . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number is the input 0 needed ) .
&quot; kt@@ t@@ sm@@ s cr@@ ashes immediately , when it started . I have de@@ comp@@ uted any support , but I don &apos;t get back . &quot;
G@@ Stre@@ amer is de@@ pl@@ eted and &amp; kt@@ on ; it was closed . probably you have to register G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is the command G@@ ST register 0.8 . if the problem is not solved therefore is a not compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can attempt to update G@@ Stre@@ amer .
&quot; the audio output via AL@@ SA does not work if I consider using another application music . if I consider a text order , free@@ zes &amp; kt@@ as ; one . on the &amp; kon@@ sole ; appears a message that says : to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; on your system the problem is to prevent conflicts at AL@@ SA , which prevent a simultaneous opening of several PC@@ M devices . notes for possible solutions can be found on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) under www.al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; I have loaded an additional voice for the festival from the Internet . I installed it and can use it in the festival , but kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr shows this voice . &quot;
&quot; add to the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / festival@@ int / Vo@@ ices , as a guide you can use the other entries . if this is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; to which you have found the voice to the developers . &quot;
&quot; on the card card audio there is a setting speed . so this works , the program must be so@@ x installed and via the ambient variable P@@ AT@@ H . some syn@@ thesi@@ ologists have to be installed on the card card for speaker facility . depending on the chosen voice is this active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the speaking speed are ignored if &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; ( that &apos;s about your own tags , with which the speed is controlled . ) de@@ activate either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; by &amp; XML ; ( see ) or if you are quite cour@@ ageous , modify the .x@@ sl file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ according to @-@ SS@@ ML @-@ format filter , and set the microphone speed . &quot;
&quot; I do not put it that web pages will be read with a female voice . I have set up a female Festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ oria ; read the websites with a male voice . &quot;
&quot; at the Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the day SA@@ B@@ LE GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . thus , the X@@ SL file allows for converting SS@@ ML to S@@ aber the GEN@@ DER @-@ tags . the same applies to VO@@ ICE tags . &quot;
&quot; I have added a own drawing board filter and now I can go in &amp; nbsp ; no more sat@@ ined orders is displayed , the order is displayed just out of one sentence . what am I doing wrong ? &quot;
&quot; award marks ( point , fac@@ ial wat@@ erm@@ arks , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) you are not allowed to filter . use for these signs instead of a filter for the pro@@ posi@@ tional detection . &quot;
AL@@ SA ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . AL@@ SA is installed on most systems with Linux ; already installed . ( www.al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org )
g@@ Stre@@ amer are registered in version 0.@@ 8.7 or newer . note : make sure that the modules for G@@ Stre@@ amer are registered by visiting G@@ Stre@@ amer ; the command G@@ ST register . ( http : / / g@@ amer@@ amer@@ .@@ fre@@ ed@@ es@@ ktop@@ .org )
&quot; some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts in the audio @-@ output . if your system is also counts , you can not perform at the same time music and then release a text . &amp; kt@@ as ; Free@@ zes , if you have a text@@ book and then start a further start . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) . &quot;
&quot; with stand July 2005 a@@ we still supports real p@@ auses . if you keep a text order in &amp; kt@@ on , the current set is still read yet . &quot;

in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 is the module &amp; arts ; probably removed or at least just on request created .
&quot; the following modules for voice syn@@ thesizer are created by default . some of them have a run @-@ time @-@ dependence of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the guidelines of the Debian distribution ) . the column configure option to switch off the creation displays the configure parameters , which brings about the ren@@ unci@@ ation of the replacement . &quot;
&quot; as pres@@ et@@ ting it is being installed ; in / opt / K@@ DE@@ 3 , this folder is not listed in the ambient variable $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR@@ S , you need to specify as an option --@@ pre@@ fix = finish . for example , &quot;

&quot; before you &amp; b ; use , check out whether your language syn@@ thesizer correctly works . follow the instructions you get with the syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
&quot; the festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer , whose source code is obvious . the quality of votes is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . with many voices you can adjust volume , speaking speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; you need to install at least one language . help you will find in the instructions provided with the festival , you need to install web pages you need to install the ( male British ) voice of Rab _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for these voices , you have to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of festival . the German votes are subject to restrictions on transfer . &quot;
&quot; this voice is set up at 1.@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in an early development stage . un@@ zip the software in the festival / lib / Vo@@ ices / Russian / . select the Russian votes , you must enter for the voices ms@@ u _ ru _ n@@ sh _ di@@ phone . select a k@@ yr@@ illi@@ c ( 8 @-@ bit ) en@@ coding like for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
&quot; the festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux , distri@@ butions . are you looking for the festival as first on the CDs of your distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the option must be assigned to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the option must be assigned to an 8 @-@ bit @-@ k@@ yr@@ illi@@ c as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
&quot; the festival can be used together with the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ Syn@@ thesizer , then takes over the lex@@ ical analysis and &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; then generates the Audio@@ Output . the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ program and the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ votes can be downloaded from
note that &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; you need additional software to create this di@@ phone . you need additional software to create these di@@ phone . festival generates these from &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; required Di@@ ph@@ one@@ . t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also create from german texts di@@ phone . more information can be found under .

&quot; this hand@@ book explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ network@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; c@@ contro@@ l@@ center , which allows the management of network interfaces , routine and DNS @-@ settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; c@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a series of system and desktop settings through a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; c@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called through the selection of K Menu c@@ contro@@ l@@ center . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Co @-@ network@@ conf ; package was developed to enable users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way , as other settings from the &amp; sec@@ ut@@ l@@ center ; create the areas of &amp; k@@ network@@ conf ; create a simple surface for the following tasks : &quot;
&quot; after installation , a new module network settings in the &amp; k@@ screen center ; displayed . the module network settings ( k@@ network@@ conf ; ) can be started by selection of c@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network network settings in &amp; k@@ menu . &quot;
&quot; it is important to understand that &amp; sec@@ tion@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers have to be installed and configured so that &amp; k@@ network@@ conf ; the device at all shows and setting up the network properties . &quot;
&quot; in most cases drivers for the network hardware and other devices are added at the install of &amp; Linux ; s network devices later added , the drivers need to be added by modification of the files , corresponding to the kernel version : &quot;
&quot; the module settings is being loaded , if the option is selected network settings in the &amp; c@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index selected , when the module settings are attempt@@ ed to detect the platform used on the system . &quot;
&quot; if the platform cannot be recognized as the platform can choose from the list , the distribution and the Rel@@ e@@ as@@ est@@ and best matches . by mark@@ ers of setting non @-@ again requests the definition can be taken permanently . at the next start of the network settings then this selection will be automatically pre@@ set . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is possible only in system administration mode . previously , all options are gray shown , what means the settings can be viewed , the change is not possible . in the system administration mode , you will be able to change by clicking on the right at the bottom of the module . it is required to enter the password . &quot;
in the system administration mode the entire functionality of the module is available in three riders :
the rider network interfaces serves to manage the network devices . all available network devices are displayed . the rider network interfaces can be performed on the following tasks :
configuration settings can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click the button to set up ... in the dialog box set up .
default is only basic TCP / IP settings . click the button below to expand the dialog with further possibilities .
&quot; in automatic mode , TCP / IP settings will be done by a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP information is done with the start of system services . in the selection list , either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP is required to be selected , according to the system . &quot;
with the selection Manual can be done without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP the TCP / IP configuration . in the input field IP @-@ address must be set the desired TCP / IP address . in the input field network mask is the sub@@ network mask .
&quot; this setting is marked , initi@@ alizes the system the network interface in the boats . if the initi@@ alization does not desire , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values in this dialogue are shown as properties of the unit in the device .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . the input of an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP address . with ping in the &amp; con@@ sole . you can determine whether the desired address is already in use . in doubt the network administrator should be asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; networking equipment can be activated or off @-@ off according to your needs . &quot; &quot; switch off @-@ off network device is done by selecting from the list and click &quot; &quot; interface &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; network devices can be activated or off @-@ off according to your needs , the activated network device is done by selecting from the list and click of the interface . &quot;
&quot; insert the IP address of the computer &apos;s in the local sub@@ network , which con@@ veys the physical connection to distant networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub @-@ networks . &quot;
&quot; if the computer is available more than a network interface , the interface is to the net , where the gateway computer is to be selected . &quot;

&quot; the machine for the nam@@ ing resolution part of the horse @-@ resolution allows an easy handling of this list . entries can be added , removed or altered wer@@ den@@ .D@@ NS entries can be ordered by selecting a registr@@ ar and adding up or her@@ ds in the priority . &quot;
by clicking the button Add ... from the group calculator to nam@@ ing resolution can be added a DNS server . it will be added to the Dialog New Nam@@ eser@@ ver .
&quot; first , you must enter the IP address of the DNS @-@ server and then click the button Add . the entry is inserted in the list . &quot;
&quot; out of the group calculator to nam@@ ing resolution , select an entry and then click on the button &apos; Edit ... It will be displayed in dialog . &quot;
&quot; the list well @-@ known machine describes data sheet @-@ to @-@ IP address for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily with boats , if no DNS @-@ server is available . in small , closed networks there can replace DNS @-@ server . &quot;
&quot; normally , the list contains well @-@ known hosts some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses support . these still in the test can be posted in the future version 4 . &quot;
enter the IP address of the familiar computer and click Add .... The New alias dialog is displayed .

select an entry of a well @-@ known calculator from the list and choose Edit ... The dialog &apos; shared computer is shown .
&quot; it can be performed one of the following tasks , then using clicking OK , the list of static hosts will be updated . &quot;
the settings made in the module settings are not immediately effective in the system . to activate the changes must be set in a &amp; console ; the following command has to be set .
&quot; the homepage of &amp; Co @-@ network@@ conf ; is http : / / k@@ network@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source text . &quot;
for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm packages ) reaches when &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t installed .
the installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and in a &amp; con@@ sole ; with rpm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a tool can be used with graphic interface like a package or the installation tool of your distribution . &quot;
&quot; for this case the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; not , but in addition , the development packages is needed with libraries and other things . &quot;
&quot; this is recommended only experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ network@@ conf@@ . the following commands should make this . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information on basic network technology is given , in the second , all by &amp; Co @-@ network@@ conf ; changeable configuration files are discussed . &quot;
this area can not replace knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information on the involvement of the PC into a small ( home ) network convey@@ ed .
&quot; currently , IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found large distribution . from IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected that it is in the near future . this description focuses on the widespread IP@@ v@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; one of the most important information is the knowledge of which IP address is available to a network interface . in foreign networks , on &amp; eg ; place is the network administrator the response , which is a valid IP address , if available , DH@@ CP is not easy to use . &quot;
&quot; if you set your own little ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specially reserved area for this purpose . the addresses from the table below are not forwar@@ ded on the Internet , therefore any use is possible . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be facilit@@ ated by setting a gat@@ ew@@ ays . &quot;
for smaller networks are mostly used addresses in the area of 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 up to 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
&quot; in addition , the grid @-@ mask is usually set on 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all calculator participants are in the same sub@@ network . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0@@ .0@@ eg ; .0.@@ 0 and 127@@ .0@@ .0.@@ 1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , which is required to use the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host ) . the default route is required for the IP forwar@@ ding . &quot;
the mains address 127@@ .0@@ .0.@@ 1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine . normally the address is assigned to 127@@ .0@@ .0.@@ 1 of its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface that works as a closed circle .
&quot; in this part , the configuration files are affected by &amp; Co @-@ network@@ conf@@ . are concerned and where they are stored in different distri@@ butions . &quot;
&quot; this file is sometimes modified at DSL connections , so it doesn &apos;t be surprised if in case of active DSL connections to other content than specified there . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; S@@ USE , is known that this file will be sorted through the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand than expected can therefore occur . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of t@@ ar . it offers the possibility to save several archives on a tape . the second goal was to answer a question that my wife was , how much longer takes it when you secu@@ res ? &quot;
&quot; before a band can be used , it must be installed by &amp; k@@ dat ; it can happen in three ways : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; sp@@ ult the band back and reads the pre@@ tension information of the tape . realize &amp; k@@ dat ; the sp@@ ell on the tape do not , you will be asked if the band should be form@@ att@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; the sp@@ ell , looks for the fitting index on your plate . can this not be found , you will be asked if the band@@ index is new to be created . &quot;
&quot; everything went smoothly , changes the symbol for the band@@ path to indicate that the band has been integrated . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the content of the tape can now be search@@ ed through exten@@ sively of the entry for the band . &quot;
&quot; before throwing the tape , first the inclusion must be resolved at first . there are three methods to achieve this . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; returns to the tape by changing the symbol for the tape , that the inclusion for the band was solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be rejected without danger . &quot;
&quot; before a band of &amp; k@@ dat ; used , it must be used by &amp; k@@ dat ; form@@ att@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; a Band@@ cards must form@@ att@@ ed before you are used to be used for storing data . this process does not need to be used before using the tape . this process is done before you can form@@ att@@ ed by the band by &amp; k@@ dat . flo@@ ppy disk drives , usually do a form@@ atting of the tape , DAT drives on the other hand . &quot;
&quot; after entering the band@@ name and the capacity drives &amp; k@@ dat ; with the form@@ atting of the tape . all data on the tape go lost ! according to completion of the form@@ atting , the band is automatically integrated and ready to use . &quot;
&quot; before you encounter the backup process , you need to select to c@@ ited files . this can happen in three ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it is only saved this file or folder .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are stored .
select files in the local file tree with a heads . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are secured .
click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and select in the menu p@@ ups ...
&quot; once the backup was introduced , the dialogue opens settings for backup . in this dialog you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings , the dialogue will be backup . the dialog displays the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archive for the drive . it will be checked only the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives on the record for the band with a tick . it will only be examined the selected files and / or sub@@ folders .
right click on one of the archives and select the menu item .
&quot; once the check @-@ process has been started , the dialogue will appear to check . in this dialog you can even check your selection and modify the absorption of the review . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for verification , the dialogue will be examined . this dialog shows the progress of the exam and the data through@@ put time and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can manage the re@@ produce , the files , which should be recovered . this can be done in two ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the registry entry . it will be restored only the selected file or sub@@ folders .
select the files from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders recovered .
right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select the menu .
&quot; once the recovery process was started , the dialogue will be created for restoration . in this dialog you can still check your selection and modify the absorption of the restoration . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for the recovery , the dialog will be re@@ produced . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as data through@@ put and the remaining time . &quot;
sometimes it proves to be necessary to create the band@@ width file using the Band@@ content . this process delet@@ es all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types from tape :
&quot; here , a backup profile associated with the currently selected files and the standard settings . you can make use of the following settings : &quot;
&quot; the current work of workers , in which the backup is to be carried out . the list of in@@ sured files will be automatically updated accordingly to the currently selected work@@ piece . &quot;
&quot; for all folders that are listed under f@@ use files , that only the files are stored on the same file system , like the folder . folder that can be stored on other fil@@ es@@ systems , you can be ordered separately under the backup files . each entry is considered by t@@ ar independently of the others . &quot;
perform a incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental Backup , a snapshot file will be saved . it will only be saved the files that has since changed since then . &quot;
the name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delet@@ es the snapshot file before the call of t@@ ar . this causes all files saved and created a new snapshot file for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; according to ; and lt ; files was not completely implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
the settings can be set up via the menu item KD@@ at ... in the menu Settings menu . the following settings allows you to make :
the full path to the device driver for the band@@ width ( normally / dev / T@@ ape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ recur@@ ve version of the band .
&quot; is this setting active , transm@@ its &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape , the command is mounted on the drive . with some drives this is necessary before reading or typ@@ ations can be performed . &quot;
is the option switched on to lock &amp; k@@ dat ; the dro@@ pping out at the band@@ width . possibly this setting does not work with all band@@ width .
&quot; if the option is switched on , when solving the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically use the tape . use this option not at flo@@ ppy Stream@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched on , is tem@@ pted to change &amp; k@@ dat ; the hard@@ disk wire for tape drives . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you must &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block @-@ size for your tape . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ dat ; a band form@@ att@@ ed , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should occupy just a memory block on the tape . the content of the file is composed as follows : &quot;
&quot; ( N Byte ) The band @-@ ID . the format of this string is invo@@ iced name : seconds , the Rech@@ ner@@ name of the complete name of the system has been form@@ att@@ ed on which the tape has been form@@ att@@ ed . seconds is the number of seconds , which has been form@@ att@@ ed since the band . &quot;
the Band @-@ ID is used to find a file using the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat .
&quot; the remaining files on the tape are pure t@@ ar archives who can manage directly with &amp; GNU ; - t@@ ar manage themselves . even other t@@ ar versions should work , as long as it is not about incre@@ mental f@@ uses . &quot;
check the contents of a backup player . this symbol is only active if a band is involved .
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Viewer for system prot@@ oc@@ ols . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users , where you can obtain information about your system or where the system allows you to get information about your system or where the system allows quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &quot;
&amp; k@@ am@@ log ; helps users to understand what your computer is in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is for in@@ experienced users who can &apos;t know where you can get information about your system or where the system depos@@ ited the various protocol files .
&quot; in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users allows quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore tries to provide some extended functions , using the protocol files of certain programs can be fil@@ tered and evaluated . &quot;
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 owns &amp; k@@ System@@ log ; a number of useful functions include :
support for many different types of log files for the format of the sy@@ s@@ log server and for Sam@@ ba
many other features are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this hand@@ book .
&quot; as you can see in the following screenshot , presents &amp; k@@ System@@ log ; functions are available , using the individual protocol @-@ lines of a protocol @-@ file easy to filter and sort . the individual possibilities for sor@@ ting and filters are shown in the next chapter of this hand@@ book . &quot;
&quot; after starting &amp; k@@ am@@ log ; first the most important protocol @-@ file of the system - the system Protocol , it will not be displayed , and it will open up with system administration right . the protocol files can usually be found in the folder / var / log , for the normal users usually do not own permission to read . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar to filter at a selected crit@@ er@@ ion or according to the subject string . in the default setting displays the selection box next to the filter . then a log line contains only appear , if in one of the columns contain the string @-@ search results . &quot;
&quot; you can also select another entry on this spot . select the string file system protocol . select for example in the log file system protocol . choose the name of a process , so shows you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all the protocol @-@ line which is sent or created by this process . &quot;
this option is activated in default settings and helps you to detect the important protocol @-@ lines . protocol @-@ lines of the level errors are shown with a striking colour as a protocol @-@ lines of the stage note . the colored representation of protocol @-@ lines can be switched on dialog box .
&quot; if you want to display only specific process ( e.g. in the system Protocol or in the Cr@@ on protocol ) , so you can examine the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . this may then be useful if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case you use the filter@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can jump the option To view new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all the new upcoming protocol @-@ lines . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows you to use multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to open this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open additional bottom windows . once you have selected a window , select a protocol on the display . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website at http : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you can find more information about the sources of &amp; k@@ System@@ log ;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; can also be found in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion Archi@@ vs : k@@ system@@ log ; in the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ archive
&quot; welcome to the &amp; k@@ de ; system V in@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also as named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; . this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the V in@@ it develops rapidly to the standard for controlling of the system at the high @-@ performance of the system in the &amp; Linux . therefore , because it is easier to use , powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD system in@@ it . &quot;
I will not go to historical aspects here ( e.g. because I know nothing about it : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . it is therefore important because maybe someone could try to switch a machine on System V in@@ it without a re@@ install and re@@ form@@ atting without a new installation and re@@ form@@ atting . therefore you need to be sure that the old in@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V in@@ it also diff@@ ers from the BSD in@@ it that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders :
&quot; in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for any system service that you want to start running the system or when changing to another run level . system services do not contain such matters such as set@@ serial , which will run only once . such views belong to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; r@@ c.@@ local should be reserved on the one hand under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems also have a lot of use for this . you can also do a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run something with the serial connection . &quot;
the kernel is searching for different places according to the program in@@ it and starts the first one finds .
&quot; the standard run level is included in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see a line as the following : &quot;
&quot; at this point you can take a look at the second column and probably determine that the pre@@ set Run@@ level 3 is . if you would like to modify the 3 / in@@ itt@@ ab out of hand and change the 3 , then get it all by running the system re@@ boot and run the following : &quot;
&quot; but how does it now start all the right scripts ? if you enter into r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following : &quot;
you will notice that in this folder there are no right files . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d . &quot;
how does it start and stops in@@ it actually system services ? very simple : each of the scripts is so written that it is an argument as start and stop . you can actually start these scripts on the command line following :
&quot; this would hold the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one K includes , the script will be called with the argument stop . if he includes a S , the script will be started with the argument start . &quot;
&quot; some people want to set up a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could win &amp; win ; a server running level , which can only run htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; run . in addition , I could also have a user level , that &amp; win ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; here you will learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult , because the program was set as user @-@ friendly as possible . &quot;
&quot; the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or a different po@@ inter is simple to tri@@ vial , just drag a entry from the range of dispos@@ ing system services to one of the six runners level to start it on this level ( or stopping ) . &quot;
&quot; you can move the scripts also between the Run@@ level@@ n or change the position within one level by changing it . however , the entry is removed from its original one level ( or its position ) . this happens only if they have an entry from the range of dispos@@ ing system services . &quot;
&quot; note : entries will be moved if you want to use them into a new domain . to select it only to a new level level , you need to choose copy from the menu or from the context menu and then insert in the target area . even if the same entry has already existed in the target range of action . &quot;
&quot; the sor@@ ting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case you must edit the sor@@ ting numbers of the surrounding entries , before you can try again to insert the system service . &quot;
&quot; note : currently there is no possibility to restore entries , which have been thrown into the tr@@ ash . be so careful . &quot;
&quot; you can use the tab@@ ulator button to enable the different work areas ( dispos@@ s@@ able system services , Run@@ level 1 start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to meet a selection of the top or below the cursor . &quot;
&quot; to move a entry into another one level , move it with cut into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and add it to the desired run level with inser@@ ting ( with C@@ trl ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change the sor@@ ting number or the name of a entry manually , press the input button to switch between different fields . close the dialog by taking the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to throw the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the danger of data transfer , all entries in the menu file require a confirmation before it will be executed . &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pres@@ ett@@ ings will be available from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) . otherwise they are stored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; restored . changes to preferences are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ level@@ n and now the machine starts out @-@ up new . what can I do ?
&quot; enter the LI@@ LO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t linux single and press the input button to start in the individual user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the default level of a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be in order ) . &quot;
&quot; I provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for running under the level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , then you must edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution . &quot;
&quot; the way of system services launched in these distri@@ butions , but does not simplify configuration of the propri@@ etary furnishing programs of this distri@@ butions , but unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you use a different distribution : please check whether all configuration files are available ( and also whether they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or htt@@ p@@ d ) just terminate without notice , if their configuration files are not available or false . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use a different distribution , please send me information about the level level so that this manual can be added . &quot;
