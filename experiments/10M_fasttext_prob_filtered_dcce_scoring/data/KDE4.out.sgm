<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialogue as to process raw materials. it uses the change and the assignment of color filming. colour mapping can be performed by the subwindow for use of color filming. a detailled manual for the use of paint-profiles can be applied to the chapters of color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu under colors Tonvaluable corrections. this tool provides an integrated way to view multiple shades of windows at the same time. this is helpful when your camera or scanner can always be the same bug and you can always find the same correction. in the manual for the sound correct correction you will find more information.</seg>

<seg id="410">"the & digists; tool color effects provides you with four colors, a solar installation, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a canton filter."</seg>
<seg id="411">"in times of chemical processing was Solarisation, also Sabatier, an effect of being created when one was developed in part developed by a short lightning light, and after the development of the image. this result was a partial negatively affected by the second lighting. this tool allows you to achieve this interesting effect."</seg>
<seg id="412">"the intensity controls the solar thermal. at about 50% intensity, the image shows what chemically possible is. a further increase creates a negative picture that is not to generate on photopapier."</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar system. the original one is the (1) and the finished (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">"the Vivid-Filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation effect, that it makes a greater contrasting effect. try it easy, it embellishes many photos."</seg>
<seg id="415">"Velvia is the brand name for one on daylight-based paint movie which is manufactured by the Japanese company Fujifilm. Velvia offers very saturated colors with daylight and high contrast. the name is a composition of" "Velvet Mediaquot; and therefore a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvias strongly saturated inks, however, are also some photographen. Velvias are many saturated inks, especially to which the barely landscapes are plain, too much."</seg>
<seg id="416">The neonfilter sily simulates Neonlight to the contrasts of the result. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the sliders repetitions the strength of the neonlight. at large pictures the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrasting and the luminosity of the photo. you can view on the different color shades of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. once you are satisfied with the result you are using the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">"if you get a photo in bad light conditions, you can get the reverse problem: one to large saturation. also in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation can reduce it. all changes you can perform in the preview. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok."</seg>
<seg id="419">"between the complex tool grading and the simple lamp / gamma is the tool sound-correct correction to improve the exposure. even if the dialogue with this tool works very complicated, you need only the range of sliders. concrete the three sliders below the histograms."</seg>

<seg id="480">"sharpening is a traditional tool for the sharpening. it is very fast and simple, but produces particularly in dark areas, grained images."</seg>
<seg id="481">Unsharpened mask works on the contrast the edges of the edges to look like a picture. actually it does not use it rather psychovisuell. you can use it rather a good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and he is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">"researches is possibly the best of the three, since it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has various parameters to adjust."</seg>
<seg id="483">"photos without focus as well as most digitised images need a correction of the sharpness. these are smaller than the dissolution. this same phenomenon can be observed in a common colour, so that the same phenomenon can be observed if color points are printed on paper. the SLR cameras require more degrazing as normal cameras for the private user."</seg>
<seg id="484">"with JPEG-images often a camera has been used internally. images in raw material, on the other hand must always be pushed into during the processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanner apply a sharpness filter already during the reading of the picture. if you disable to deactivate this, you get control of your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get usable outcomes by using a photo with the sharpness. this allows you to call the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">"but you should deal with caution, as the results do not work very natural: the sharpness increases the sharpness of the edges, but also intensify the smoke. in general, you can reach more information about the menu entry. under refocussing you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for the sharpness."</seg>
<seg id="488">"sometimes you have the opposite problem: one picture is too cruny. the solution, the image is a little soft to draw, is much easier than it comes to sharpen. use the tool on the right side of the dialog box shows you the effect on your photo."</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter bluram is a very good tool to remove slider from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview will help you edit the image. the preview of the filter shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values are often good results and should be tried out first. an increase in radius or the amount amplify the effect. if you produce the Unsharpness mask, become smoothing and the impression of grats in the proximity of sharp edges."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius presents one like many pixels on each side of a canned by the filter. high resolution images allow greater radii. you should therefore find pictures at the best in their final dissolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage of the original and the wiped image one of the original is added to the original. thus the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">"the tail value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applied difference level. you can thereby define a minimum difference in this way for a soft difference between the tones of sharpening and therefore beautifull error in faces, Heavens and water bodies."</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example designed for the inblursharp filter. the original picture is the (1) and the working image has been applied (2). blursharp masking was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a tail = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digitization; tool focused on an image by improving the sharpness. it used to ensure the protected protected filter algorithm from Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to make a picture to & quot; refocussing. this is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener filtering. they can usually launch better results as an inblurred mask. they can usually launch it from the menu by using colors Refocusing in the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice the circular thread works much better than the Gauß'sche Faltung. the Gauß'sche Faltung. the FIR Vienna Inverse of the Gauß'ch Faltung is even influenced by the original pixel rate. the FIR Vienna Inverse of the Gauß'ts can be influenced in most cases even very strongly affected by the remote pixel. this caused unwanted results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular thread. it is the most important parameter for the use of this module. for most images the default value should put 1 good results. you can put a higher value if your picture is very inblurred then should appear to be heightened.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help reduce artifacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0,5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and max. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpest effect of the module. "</seg>
<seg id="501">"smoking filter: an increase in the noise filter may help you reduce artefacts. however, values higher than 0.1 is rarely helpful. however, values are higher than 0,1. however, the brightness is very bad. a high value is 0.03. a high value will continue to taste the image."</seg>
<seg id="502">"Gauß's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauß'sche's sharpness. use this parameter if your Unsharpness is caused. in most cases you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts, so you might need to increase the correlation and / orderless filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">"mattress size: this value determines the size of the transformer size: this value determines good results, especially if you choose great values for the circular sharpness or the Gauß's sharpness. however, note that the module is very slow when you choose great values for this parameter. in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">The save and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any rejects parameters that you have set for later and can then be loaded on.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to carry out all the additives, color and intensity corrections on the image before you use the module. "</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise, you should use the module before you change the image. the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible, but later unpleasant artifacts left."</seg>
<seg id="507">"when you read images and compress, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image."</seg>
<seg id="508">"generally, blur better results for sharpness. this could be caused by this, the blurred masking used to use a larger neighbourhood than sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="509">"theoretically, blur. even under optimal conditions it is necessary to remove artefacts. even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of the sharpness. for the Wiener filter you can show that it is the optimal lineare filter. virtually is the result of the FIR Wiener filter is often better in the processing of small details."</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can compare a comparison between different filters on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp paint image must be corrected. this picture was made using a analogue camera. the unfocused result is attributable to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>

<seg id="1519">A brief list of parameters for audio quality and turned out of it to 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">"--preset standard '= These attitude should normally offer transparency for most people and most of the music-pieces acceptable, and has a very high quality. good enough for HiFi stereosing plants with high quality."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, Compression rate up to 6.3 mm needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for HiFi stereosks with high quality. this is the preferred choice."</seg>
<seg id="1523">"--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate approximately 5.5. needs 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a song. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for HiFi stereosing with high quality."</seg>
<seg id="1524">"-h '= 128 kbps CBR joint stereo, compression rate approximately 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a song. good enough for music of young people, portable devices and car-eaters. but not good enough for better HiFi stereosing systems."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting is exaggerated for most people and most environments but if you definitely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size, then select this setting."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"the & CD; information, which is manually entered or obtained from the freeDB via the Internet, are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can transfer / used with & kaudiocreator; and the encoding program to create the folder and file names and the characteristics of the music files."</seg>
<seg id="1527">"in connection with code programs, there are often a combination of programs for the co-erer and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoding explain the switches for these programs."</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for example, to add the & CD; title to the keywords (English: tag) if MP3s must be coded with lame, the switch seld of lame and the title parameters of & kaudiocreator; added. the result looks as follows: '... -tt {title}...'."</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & audiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button-bar in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">"that's what the freeDB is: a free database which can be downloaded and enter the audio CD, so that all other those information can be downloaded instead of yourself into the computer: & CD; title, artist, names of pieces & etc., not by the audio file itself."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"yes, it should be legal, but I (Anke of the Ueberger) is not a lawyer. however, the information is meant to be removed from the & CD; more or less worthless, so may not be added neither to the artist nor the music enterprise. all the information can be found with a bumblebee through a & CD; shop, physical or virtualized."</seg>
<seg id="1532">"in & kaudiocreator; is active a cross-box address (sending an address). in this type of configuration, it appears, the e-mail address is not used when retrieving the data from the server (This can only know the programmer who has reviewed the code.)"</seg>
<seg id="1533">"there are in many countries copies of the main database. if & audiocreator; used to use freeDB, the geographical server is needed. this saves bandwidth in the network and resembles the load between the machines."</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org returns an up-to-date list of mirror servers for the online retrieval of & CD; information during reading a & CD; alternatively you can download the complete database or (normally created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which trigger program is used to save pieces from the & CD; in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">"there are rumors that it is used to cdanoanoia; who wants to know more accurately, search in source code.... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD. see To be noted that the cdparanoia package must be installed first to be installed if this is not yet done."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"to the saving of the WAV files, the codile and thus the desired file format will be chosen. when the first opening there are predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a verlustfree compressing for audio data) on the tab of the encoder. other codiers can be added at this tab."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The diver package must be installed from the corresponding Linux distribution. this is also required for the predefined codiers. more information about Kodiers can be found in the chapter Worldwide Codiers.</seg>
<seg id="1539">"after installing a codierers you can receive further information on his switch, by entering a command such as lame - help or lame --help in a consolenwindow (eg; console). in this way it must be replaced by the name of the installed codiers."</seg>
<seg id="1540">"this can have many causes. check the setup of the device name of the & CD; / DVD drives, the spelling and readers are installed on both cdparanoia as well as the audio encoder of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, FLAC & etc.). try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal. this could give an indication of what is wrong."</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want to read a copy-protected audio CD; check out the envelope of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">"there is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips how to proceed."</seg>
<seg id="1543">"have you read the complete manual, everything understood but are somehow still insecure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want."</seg>

<seg id="1549">Here we determine the unfolding codiers for compression of music (lame) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps) and which structure is used to use the freeDB to use the freeDB to download the & CD; data from the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">"although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change with each reading a & CD; change when once the appropriate settings are found."</seg>

<seg id="1663">"the optional All KeysTo M is needed to put all tones with the number M. if your keyboard is not supported (GM-Patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60), the same as a gun powder. for this you wear the following in the PATCHMAP Section:"</seg>
<seg id="1664">"if now a MIDI file should play a touch with patch 127 (gun shot), it takes Patch 100 (the Drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, regardless of which sound is available in the MIDI file."</seg>

<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is needed to specify as tints on a specific channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as with the PATCHMAP section, the order of lines is very important, so their availability. you must therefore create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several mymaps for each channel and every instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">"Keymcaps are used mainly to train tints on the Perkussion canal. take a look at the details supplied by Keymaps."</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to map some channels to others. if you want to exchange for example the first and second channel, you can easily get in CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have percussion for a specific channel (general MIDI to channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"Midi-Devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section therefore has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following patterns:"</seg>

<seg id="1674">The Forcepatch option can be useful for example to always use the Perkiller patch in the Perkussion channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for PitchBenderratio gives in which relation of Pitch-Bender event will be multiplied. if a MIDI file sends a pitch, this with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then only passed on. the value 4096 is used, so that in the Map file no decimal."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting is needed, because GM there is a keyboard, which is a Pitch-Bender event with the value 4096 to play a sound higher. unfortunately, but try some keyboards to play two tints up to an octave higher. to try the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid."</seg>

<seg id="2283">"the program used by me would only showed me the modified lines, but I could not see what changed within these lines. and there was no evidence of the places where perhaps only the initiation had changed. the merging of these changes was a small nightmare."</seg>
<seg id="2284">That was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could represent differences within one line and changes to white signs. later still a lot of further useful features were added.</seg>

<seg id="2958">I will not go to historical aspects here (e.g. because I know nothing about it: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. it is therefore important because maybe someone could try to switch a machine on System V init without a reinstall and reformatting without a new installation and reformatting. therefore you need to be sure that the old init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV init also differs from the BSD init that the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc are instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">"init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for any system service that you want to start running the system or when changing to another run level. system services do not contain such matters such as setserial, which will run only once. such views belong to rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"rc.local should be reserved on the one hand under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems also have a lot of use for this. you can also do a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run something with the serial connection."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is searching for different places according to the program init and starts the first one finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"the standard run level is included in / etc / inittab. you should see a line as the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point you can take a look at the second column and probably determine that the preset Runlevel 3 is. if you would like to modify the 3 / inittab out of hand and change the 3, then get it all by running the system reboot and run the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it now start all the right scripts? if you enter into rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that in this folder there are no right files. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d. "</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does it start and stops init actually system services? very simple: each of the scripts is so written that it is an argument as start and stop. you can actually start these scripts on the command line following:</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would hold the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the one K includes, the script will be called with the argument stop. if he includes a S, the script will be started with the argument start."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people want to set up a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could win & win; a server running level, which can only run httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc; run. in addition, I could also have a user level, that & win; & kdm;, network & etc."</seg>
<seg id="2971">"here you will learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult, because the program was set as user-friendly as possible."</seg>
<seg id="2972">"the use of & ksysv; with a mouse or a different pointer is simple to trivial, just drag a entry from the range of disposing system services to one of the six runners level to start it on this level (or stopping)."</seg>
<seg id="2973">"you can move the scripts also between the Runleveln or change the position within one level by changing it. however, the entry is removed from its original one level (or its position). this happens only if they have an entry from the range of disposing system services."</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries will be moved if you want to use them into a new domain. to select it only to a new level level, you need to choose copy from the menu or from the context menu and then insert in the target area. even if the same entry has already existed in the target range of action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries, before you can try again to insert the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">"note: currently there is no possibility to restore entries, which have been thrown into the trash. be so careful."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the tabulator button to enable the different work areas (dispossable system services, Runlevel 1 start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to meet a selection of the top or below the cursor."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move a entry into another one level, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired run level with inserting (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change the sorting number or the name of a entry manually, press the input button to switch between different fields. close the dialog by taking the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to throw the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the danger of data transfer, all entries in the menu file require a confirmation before it will be executed."</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. presettings will be available from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc). otherwise they are stored by & ksysv; restored. changes to preferences are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard Runleveln and now the machine starts out-up new. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"enter the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in the individual user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default level of a reasonable value (3 should normally be in order)."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"I provided some system services with & ksysv; for running under the level X, but they are not executed."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"if you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), then you must edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the way of system services launched in these distributions, but does not simplify configuration of the proprietary furnishing programs of this distributions, but unfortunately no standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you use a different distribution: please check whether all configuration files are available (and also whether they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) just terminate without notice, if their configuration files are not available or false."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the meaning of the & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use a different distribution, please send me information about the level level so that this manual can be added."</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">"to start with & kuser; it's sufficient to read the chapter adjustment of & kuser."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"after having made changes, you must save it. either use the corresponding symbol of the toolbar or the entry save in the menu file."</seg>
<seg id="2992">"& kuser; is an easy application. the main window consists of two card-cards, user interface and user account list. to choose the desired user or the desired group with a double-click on the entry. it appears the dialogue user and group properties."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"some card-cards are displayed only if you have extended system settings. only if you have extended system settings, a card card will be activated, if you have individual settings, if shadow -passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd as in BSD Unixes are installed."</seg>
<seg id="2994">The card-card passwords appears if shadow passwords need to be installed or e.g. / etc / master.passwd as in BSD -universes.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"this card card will only be activated, if for at least one built-in filesystem (Quota) enabled and initialized (recognizable at the file quota.user / quota.group on the file system). here you can be modified for each user parameters, whereby the limited number of details in KB are:"</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each file system. the current file system is selected using the system of the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2997">"the card-card groups informs about the group belonging to the selected user. the standard group, to which the user belongs, you will find in the field of Primary Group. furthermore, the user can mark the user in other groups by mark it in the large field."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"the dialogue properties of the group contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list."</seg>
<seg id="2999">"to add a user or a group, select Add from the menu or group or click on the appropriate add button of the toolbar. the Edit or deleting the selected users or the selected group works analog."</seg>
<seg id="3000">"with this module you can install the LILO boot Manager, remove and modify, remove the time up to the boats of the standard operating system, remove the default work system, remove, modify, modify, change and more."</seg>
