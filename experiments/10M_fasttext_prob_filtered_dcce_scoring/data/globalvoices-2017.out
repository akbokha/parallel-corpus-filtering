&quot; although I had attended the USA since 2012 at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is exceptionally large .
&quot; as many of my generation I grew up with American films up to American music , American authors read and operated his sport . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had a very profound effect on me that I became mainly because of an American film journalist . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I played the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , who covered with the help of Julia Roberts as a Jura @-@ student , who were the Supreme Regional Court with judges that were his interest . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free after meth@@ od Man , &quot; me &quot; s , as if the absolute truth is , for@@ gets anything else , that is what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year , that I lived in Arizona , I had even greater my admir@@ ation for the United States . &quot;
&quot; I always said , &quot; America is the only country where I have ever lived , whose variety is so welcoming that you are always the one that you are and it is easy acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I had even written a very black@@ ish love about his size .
then Donald Tru@@ mp came .
much has been written about the xen@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his as@@ cen@@ sion is for me as he goes with his bott@@ len@@ derness .
&quot; he never stops behind the mountain , as one says so beautiful . &quot;
&quot; he says what he thinks about how a former colleague put it , and explains publicly his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ ver@@ ans and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people have responded to his statements and voted in favour for him . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes he won by the Republi@@ can pre @-@ elections , was the highest number that ever achieved by the Party nomin@@ ee . &quot;
I was speech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ so@@ ons person when I asked myself ?
I could not bring Tru@@ mp and his voters with the people that I met in Phoenix during my time .
&quot; as for example , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , Director of the journalist , the people from all over the world , a deep belie@@ ver that I could talk about Islam and his past . &quot;
&quot; even Tru@@ mp@@ s world vi@@ vi@@ ation not with the author of Peter Bh@@ atia , the present editor of &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er &quot; , &quot; over@@ looked . &quot;
&quot; Bh@@ atia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours with this , the &quot; Phoenix vacation &quot; at the game . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp@@ s intoler@@ ance also stands in contrast to gener@@ osity that I lived by Sandy B@@ ahr who fought for her life long and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son . &quot;
&quot; nor does it fit to the commitment of Krist@@ i Cav@@ es , who always helped with a lot of patience and grace to me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of the American life . &quot;
&quot; then there were Andrew Fri@@ ey , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors whose wise coun@@ ties helped me a lot in my career . &quot;
these people and those by they healed values deep@@ ened my love for America .
&quot; while Tru@@ mp his way to the appointed Republi@@ can presidential data , they offered me a grip and the counter@@ part to his limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on 8 November 2016 over 50 million Americans , mostly white , the presidency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his cont@@ emp@@ t towards non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the confrontation with the idea that people have voted for Tru@@ mp because they have shared either his rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were prepared to over@@ look these things , broke me almost the heart . &quot;
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tru@@ mp @-@ voters as a r@@ assi@@ sts .
&quot; people to arrange , said one of my friends , is exactly what has led us to this situation . &quot;
that is super@@ ficial and respec@@ t@@ less and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those in a different way and think .
it shows the people that their worries and fears about the he@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
&quot; could it be that these voters , from which most of which are , for Tru@@ mp , because they would like to reg@@ ain control over a country that she disappointed ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they might want to say that they are still important in this America ? &quot;
perhaps .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David re@@ nick who commented that the cru@@ el decision to rise a man who look with cont@@ emp@@ t on those who look differently than he . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( An@@ c@@ d. ) . : as much as &quot; &quot; bor@@ row@@ ed of white against all other eth@@ ni@@ cs &quot; ; wor@@ ding of white in An@@ de@@ cks on the white and whi@@ pl@@ ash , which means as much means like Sch@@ leu@@ der@@ trau@@ ma ) , as it was the great Van Jones , has just been killed , what America has made so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world cher@@ ish the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background one can always have , America is definitely welcome . &quot;
&quot; for this land chose as his president , twice the son of a Ken@@ ian@@ leader , whose history , as he says himself , nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; but with choosing Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s , there is a huge part of the white America of this promise , and says : to hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole concept of plur@@ alism . &quot;
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is again on the ruin .
&quot; in all this I have to think about K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Kh@@ an , the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq , and what he said to the eve of the choice . &quot;
on a r@@ ally for Hill@@ ary Clinton Mr. Kh@@ an had a word change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp , would have my son , captain ho@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; Mr. Kh@@ an . &quot;
&quot; the crowd answered with a loud &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; brood the crowd . &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ ins have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; answering them . &quot;
did A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; they called them and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot;
&quot; could anyone who is not as you , a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a voc@@ al and loud &quot; NE@@ IN &quot; !
&quot; Mr. Kh@@ an ended with the words : &quot; &quot; God was thanks , Mr. Tru@@ mp , that is not your America . &quot; &quot; 36 hours later it was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the land , for which his son was , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now Tru@@ mp@@ s country , said the message . &quot;
&quot; and all people who look like Mr. Kh@@ an , could no longer find a place in this new America . &quot;
and that breaks my heart .

what has the Mexican music school of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean town Cat@@ e@@ ura common ?
&quot; that the music that is played on both places , not only the lives of the children has changed , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large gar@@ bage dump , only 16 kilometers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city which is very popular among tourists but worlds from the nearby ro@@ umb@@ ic ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; for several years now , the La B@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( Musik@@ ban@@ de ) now plays a sym@@ phony orchestra in the municipality : one of the children and adults of the existing sym@@ phony orchestra , which has found an opportunity to overcome them surrounding them . &quot;
a Musik@@ schule with 100 students has become the central interest for the municipality of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the community , which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mex@@ ic@@ os , is known for their drug abuse and ban@@ dage violence . &quot;
&quot; however , this after an acci@@ dental meeting with a French pilot , which started a musical project and the youth had such a rare hope . &quot;
&quot; the young band@@ members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , the local press of Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca n@@ vi : &quot;
&quot; once they come from the school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ pe streets to prove her big passion . &quot;
&quot; they come always laugh@@ ing and play with glos@@ sy eyes and play in the Tru@@ bel you learn Day for Day trumpet , trombone , pic@@ colo , clarinet , flute , ken@@ horn , Pau@@ ke , bon@@ g@@ os and the Con@@ ga . &quot;
music from the rub@@ b@@ ish
&quot; more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village which is practically at the top of the largest gar@@ bage dump of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments that are made of recycl@@ ed waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with recycl@@ ed instruments , which consist of local solid waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura , where the recycling under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez have begun to transform parts of the aby@@ ss into instruments . &quot;
&quot; instruments im@@ i@@ tiz@@ ers , viola , C@@ elli , double @-@ bass , guitars , flutes , trumpet , tromb@@ ones and percussion , which were all made out of the tr@@ ash . &quot;
&quot; the re@@ pertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article from the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and Musi@@ cians &apos; teacher of the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura , to the initial time : &quot;
&quot; first of all , it was very difficult because we had no room for rehear@@ sals and we had to teach at the same place where parents knew no music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them do not live with their children . &quot;
this changed as a F@@ avi@@ o something he had never seen before : one out of waste .
today there is a whole orchestra that plays on instruments made of revi@@ ved material and called The Recy@@ cl@@ ed Orchestra .
a documentation called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic gar@@ bage dump ) draws the musical performance to :
every year the world generates around one billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish .
&quot; those who live with him and from him are the troub@@ les - like the people of Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspir@@ ational spectac@@ le of tr@@ ash @-@ music around the world .
the Orchestra has even played his music in the Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and teamwork can be successful in fight against illegal fishing
photo Â© Fish @-@ i Africa - a project that is fighting the wild and illegal fishing .
&quot; this post , written by Emma Bry@@ ce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , published in a magazine that specifically reports international , practical solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
the re@@ publication occurs within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for sharing content .
in West Africa the ship was known that this ship had already operated in liberal waters of illegal fishing before the other coast of Africa studied .
&quot; the East African countries were therefore transferred , and little gen@@ ei@@ gh , to welcome a legislative cr@@ ush@@ ers of this kind in its co@@ asts . &quot;
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the compress@@ ors , Mozambique and the Seychelles mobil@@ ised rapidly against the ship . they ref@@ uted him , one of their har@@ bours and WE@@ IG@@ C also to give him a fishing permit . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; urine was the prime minister surrounded by countries who simply had to refuse everything , Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a leading employee of the Ken@@ yan fisher@@ y . he is part of a team that discovered the ship in stone . &quot;
in 2013 the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch him there .
&quot; finally , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to liber@@ ia , due to lo@@ oting the fish stocks of the country . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , the criminal practices crossed and resources protect , was Fish @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the NR@@ O Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal fishing ) . &quot;
&quot; the members of this network are beside Somalia and Madagascar , the six countries that had been driven by their waters at that time . &quot;
&quot; &quot; in this way , we have eight countries who are like @-@ minded people and work together . you will exchange information and stand each other at where it &apos;s about illegal fishing . &quot; , &quot; says Tony Long , Head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project offers Fish @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is controlled by definition : what is im@@ pris@@ oned , is hid , present because it is extremely difficult to send it . this is the illegal fishing a major watch of over@@ fishing regions . &quot;
&quot; acci@@ dental abuse of existing laws , by which certain habitats and types are to be protected , can harm the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems which have a del@@ ik@@ y balance . &quot;
&quot; however , while action against illegal fishing was once hin@@ dered by bureau@@ crati@@ c hur@@ d@@ les and also through the sn@@ ail , so these actions occur nowadays in real time , with trac@@ eable on Fish @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platforms . &quot;
&quot; for example , the individual countries can interact with one another for example , lists of existing licenses , news or details that you have noticed or experienced during a port . &quot;
&quot; Fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive when they move to the open sea , using satellite data . &quot;
&quot; this allows the authorities to mark ships that are fishing in ban areas . also , such as susp@@ ected routes will discover - about such that invites you to cur@@ se its cap@@ tiv@@ ated fish on other ships . &quot;
&quot; in the ide@@ al@@ inci@@ dent , such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license , where they were on the go and possibly also whether they have a criminal register . &quot;
&quot; countries that are against illegal fishing , can refuse the acceptance of such ships in their ports . what means the ships could not sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to numbers of pen@@ alties , as in the case of the Premier . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is then a significant financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is not worth any longer worth it . &quot;
&quot; and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , leading Director of NF@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consultant company dedicated to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports Fish @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the already mentioned platform was created to estimated 20 million USD to lost sales , which will lose eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i every year because of the illegal fishermen who penet@@ rate into East African waters . &quot;
&quot; East @-@ Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fish , present for the region of commercial fishing from all over the world . among these also these illegal fishermen . &quot;
&quot; these practices include inter alia actions , such as the sailing among fal@@ sely flag , f@@ ake license papers , indication of ph@@ oned species , fish @-@ protected species and fishing in protected areas . &quot;
&quot; &quot; they use the lack of international cooperation and make the weaknesses of an un@@ complete control system increase , &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; earlier a ship could not fish illeg@@ ally and a country could then say &apos; You dar@@ f@@ st my port not going . &quot;
but another country could say &apos; com@@ m to me &apos; . &apos; and exactly this leg@@ ale lo@@ op@@ lo@@ ch tried Fish @-@ i now to close .
the closed Front .
since its foundation Fish @-@ i was involved in more than 30 studies of susp@@ ected vessels .
&quot; it has revealed criminal networks , which had f@@ ake licenses distributed in Tanzania . it discovered ships that have been tr@@ apped and found several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has been tr@@ apped and found . &quot;
&quot; due to its collaboration with Inter@@ pol , the international authority for the fight against crime , Fish @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing across large distances . &quot;
&quot; some of our studies lead us fairly far into the networks of organised crime &quot; , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; he builds a system that should help Fish @-@ i , susp@@ ects ships precise and quiet . &quot;
photo with kind permission of Fish @-@ i Africa .
&quot; Fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is always further developed , also helps to send the illegal ships . &quot;
&quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and position to hide , &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Che@@ f@@ analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g M@@ at Tracking , an NGO who also deals with fisheries data and Fish @-@ i technical support . &quot;
some of the ships turn off for example their automatic identification systems that they cannot be accompanied by satellite .
&quot; Cop@@ eland therefore helps to build a system that connects different information levels with each other . it should help Fish @-@ i to find criminal ships with greater precision . &quot;
a model programme
but can Fish @-@ i &apos;s team African nations actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the NR@@ O Sky@@ Truth , believes that . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened a platform Global Fishing Watch platform : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed throughout the world by means of the position of each trac@@ eable ship worldwide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; join forces with the neighbors to get a better picture of what where is doing - this is simply sense , &quot; &quot; says he . &quot; &quot; here is an opportunity for countries to unite and combine their resources for investigation . &quot;
&quot; we should do this on a global level . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable tru@@ sts have a similar project to run , in which a global system allows persecution of ships . &quot;
&quot; there are signs that Fish @-@ i &apos;s activities are not only criminal , but they are also det@@ er@@ red . &quot;
ships that earlier without license must have f@@ ished and hardly ever had consequences they know that they are observed .
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in Fish @-@ i took some of the countries involved in a 33 % increase in fisheries set , since fishing boats is growing more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after Fish @-@ i Somalia had helped , Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found there on board to@@ wing networks , whose use is prohibited . &quot;
photo with kind permission of Fish @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries notice these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strongly that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we are a study objective . &quot; &quot; in West Africa , hundreds of millions of dollars will disappear through illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , 2015 six countries have joined forces , so called West Africa Task Force . they also fight against illegal fishing , after exactly the same model such as Fish @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; the goal is to create more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , Fish @-@ i &apos;s younger member could report its first major tri@@ umph : in October it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship which were under false flag on the go . and not only was the ship on the way and were used to@@ w networks , which is now forbidden . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also included in bot@@ her@@ ed waters which are reserved for fishermen in Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the taking of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they continue against illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for Fish @-@ i this is a further success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a particular , collaborative working method works for the protection of the oceans is actually working in the entire world sea . Emma Bry@@ ce is independent journalist and lives in London . there she writes on environment , technology and nutrition . &quot;
&quot; their articles will appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , TE@@ D Education , the New York Times and in the Guardian . situation in Venezuela is continuing to rec@@ oll@@ ed demonstrations in several cities with the aim of con@@ quer the country . &quot;
the street movements in Venezuela only seem to be the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are regarded as a protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum for the revival of the President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro .

&quot; after the Government of Venezuela , the application of the opposition had rejected a referendum to a referendum , re@@ acted the Venezu@@ el@@ ans who gathered the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country by gathered themselves together on the streets . &quot;
under the has@@ ht@@ ag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ement of Venezuela ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them .
&quot; the debate is also led in other parts of the country - among other things in the flat land@@ land Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ des regions MÃ©@@ rida and T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira , in the central mountain@@ side Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o , and at the Isla Margar@@ ita in the State of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the political and economic situation of the country is deteri@@ or@@ ating continuously , what makes it noticeable in the everyday life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by a ac@@ ute lack of food and drugs . &quot;
&quot; many representatives of the opposition saw in the am@@ bition of the current President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro the chance of a fundamental change , but ultimately , the post@@ ure of a re@@ election was blocked by the official authorities . &quot;
Mari@@ anne D@@ Ã­@@ az &apos;s contribut@@ ors with Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , sums up in their newest articles in the context of governmental influence : &quot;
&quot; as part of the social , political and economic crisis , in which the inflation and tissues leads to the highest level of food and medicine , the referendum held for many as the only way to con@@ quer the country the chance to con@@ quer its institutional structures and close a new government . &quot;

&quot; there the prot@@ esters went back to the local cathedral , to protect themselves according to their own statement in front of the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government . &quot;
&quot; hours later they left the cathedral again , but the protests went further . &quot;

&quot; meanwhile , an Info@@ graphic shows the round , which forms the extent of repression per day : &quot;

many representatives of the government had ques@@ tioned the validity of the demand for a ministry procedure . this was now proven in the eyes of many through the presence of inn@@ um@@ erable people on the road .

&quot; this is an adapted version of a interview with Ale@@ jo GÃ³@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 at D@@ Ã­a a D@@ Ã­a , a Argent@@ ine news page . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father , the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine@@ an city CÃ³rdoba . &quot;
&quot; as now adult man said Qui@@ j@@ ano , now as part of the large La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ ber@@ a process in the province of CÃ³rdoba , against his father . &quot;
&quot; in the process , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were examined , which were committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
&quot; starting with the BÃ¼r@@ de , the same name as his father to wear up to the brut@@ al military units in prison La Per@@ la , which he watched at the age of 15 , has enough suffered . &quot;
34 years of long he kept the family @-@ secrets for himself .
in the situation then I felt that was fine .
I felt like a obe@@ dience .
&quot; as a child with 15 years , you do not notice that one will manipul@@ ated by his father . &quot;
&quot; at that time , I could not recognize that my father was a th@@ ief , Fol@@ ter@@ er and mur@@ der@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie@@ be@@ am@@ ter . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an Military ature from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state patri@@ ot@@ ism , was his father from 1976 to 1978 to be Deputy Committee of sec@@ recy 141 at prison La Per@@ la . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano .
archived .
&quot; but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ press@@ ors that was charged because of ab@@ duction in 158 cases , torture , murder in nearly 100 cases and the kid@@ n@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year child . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ anos son , a man who had experienced the extent of atro@@ cities that he had experienced as a boy , and who said before a federal court against his own father . &quot;
&quot; his story shows , which great power has a parent for his child , and how this child has chosen for himself a way of salvation . &quot;
from the Sports Hall to the military base .
&quot; when my father began to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I had made myself with a boy , the martial arts . &quot;
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a couple of days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo and called me to identify my friend .
he said :
&quot; you are an ar@@ sch@@ lo@@ ch , you fre@@ ed you with one of the ERP . &quot;
pass only on that they will not lead you to one day and then save you .
the abbreviation ERP stands for Ej@@ Ã©r@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ z@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo - revolution@@ aries - the military arm of the revolutionary parties of Argentina .
therefore he offered me to go back into the sports hall . some days later he took me with the work on the military base .
&quot; he said to me , I would be obe@@ yed . &quot;
I was 15 years old and thought I thought that would be fine . for that my father had moved me .
&quot; in the military base , I had to consume Pap@@ ers who had heard the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; these were all kinds of documents : university connections , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda books , just everything . &quot;

&apos;@@ there the prisoners are tor@@ tured
my father took me a total of vi@@ erm@@ al to La Per@@ la with everything in 1976 .
during the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
&quot; when he took me the second time he took me to walk . he led me to a bar@@ racks , in the cars , furniture , TV , refriger@@ ators - just everything possible - were . &quot;
everything about it was st@@ olen .
&quot; he gave me a little into a ceiling wr@@ ack cloth and comm@@ anded me to wear it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a great cl@@ ump of silver . &quot;
&quot; on that day I went to the other end of Bar@@ ac@@ ke , where those objects were engra@@ ved and talked with a wax . &quot;
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
and the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
&quot; I returned and saw a ne@@ sts , lying on the human being tor@@ tured . &quot;
it looked like a field bed and metal springs .
&quot; later , I found out that they attached to the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was cap@@ tiv@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; they rarely gra@@ ined a person with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , over@@ shot him with water and ch@@ asing it a charge of 220 vol@@ ts in the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the gest@@ ank there penet@@ rated there was ab@@ omin@@ able ... like a sh@@ red@@ ly win@@ ches .
&quot; years later , when my father stood under house @-@ rest , the same smell came from his room . &quot;
I realized the smell immediately and me became clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a person can do so much sor@@ row ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I knew that these people were killed &quot;
&quot; when my father took me for the third time for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were cap@@ tiv@@ ated with hand@@ sh@@ als and were t@@ opp@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , a civilians who also was charged in the process ) and I used the opportunity to take a look at La cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked men with the face down - everyone was cap@@ tiv@@ ated on hands and feet .
near the entrance k@@ au@@ ded people silent on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; as my father noticed that I saw to the prisoners he said , &quot; &quot; What gu@@ ck@@ est thou so , ar@@ sch@@ lo@@ ch ? &quot;
&quot; I paid &quot; &quot; Why hast thou hast brought me ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were sent to a pit and buried by soldiers and buried him .
I know that because my father told at home .
&quot; besides La cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were referred to as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero there a man collap@@ sed and killed .
&quot; ( according to the survi@@ vor@@ s of civil society Jorge Rom@@ ero , which was also charged at La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ ber@@ a process , the students of Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) . &quot;
&quot; in the following video Emi@@ lio F@@ essia introduces , the leader of the memorial for La Per@@ la , through the former post @-@ chambers . &quot;
&quot; the way , in which you came here , is also the way , on which the kid@@ n@@ led here came here . &quot;
&quot; when you look at the map , see that they took about this way and then be tor@@ tured for the first time . &quot;
here their names have been changed and they got a number assigned as part of the process of the human factor .
&quot; when they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement of above came out that they should be displ@@ aced . &quot;
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the redemption of the people and the dis@@ appearance of their corp@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; war@@ fare &apos;
my father brought all sorts of st@@ olen things home .
at that time at the age I had no idea what the &quot; war pre@@ y &quot; - as they were sc@@ anned .
&quot; but when I was later in the military , I was in the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - I was clear that war would cause a bay@@ onet , or perhaps military signs that one has fought one enemy . &quot;

&quot; but when you go into a house and get the fridge , the turn@@ table , clothes , paintings , money ... sti@@ r , then this is not a war pre@@ y but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I always asked myself , like my father , the leader of security forces , with this Vand@@ alism . &quot;
I just don &apos;t understand it .
&quot; I was also the officer at the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie , and I would never like to enter into a house , and ste@@ al everything in it . &quot;
I don &apos;t understand how my Father could do that .
&quot; once he called me a crime , and I answered , and thou art the cars on the road . &quot;
you are not a crime ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded before W@@ ut , suggested me and cr@@ ying : &quot;
&quot; if you walk so far , then I will find you and bring you intr@@ insi@@ c . &quot;
for this we need no one another !
so my father was .
I have no good memory of him .
&quot; when I said in the process , I showed a photo of then , on which I had a jacket and a sco@@ oter made of w@@ ool . both my father had made from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he still brought clothes with home . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the defence , a co @-@ conspir@@ ators had been with this crime . I ref@@ rain , no problem , they can lay down to the burden of what they wanted . &quot;
I was anyway there to send .
&apos;@@ The sharpen@@ ing of the corp@@ se is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act &apos;
&quot; now , where I am older , I find Re@@ ue . &quot;
&quot; I have children . if you only have children , one can recognize the value of a life . &quot;
one develops and realis@@ es that it is false to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; well , you have ex@@ al@@ ted during the dictatorship of the dictatorship . but where the corp@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
why children perform ?
one day my father had been killed a girl with home whose mother was killed .
&quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl . &quot;
I asked me again the question : they were tor@@ tured but why were they killed ?
one could simply have put them into prison .
&quot; I guess it was simply chosen to kill these people , but why to disappear into their corp@@ ses ? &quot;
had these people not even families where one could commit their mor@@ tal over@@ remains ?
the win@@ den@@ ing of the corp@@ se is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act that man can do to a man .
&quot; my father told me when the democracy was introduced back , they took machines to eliminate the mor@@ tal over@@ remains of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were destroyed and somewhere made - no idea , where . &quot; &quot; you will never find anything &quot; , &quot; said my father . &quot;
but anything remains of course always .
I have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
only to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my father .
&quot; the thought , to view my Father , was developed during a conversation , when he was under the ar@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; I made him sp@@ ake because of all of the atro@@ cities , which I had to experience . &quot;
&quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; I do not know . I have no one killed . &quot;
&quot; I felt married and asked myself to the whole exag@@ ger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they sup@@ pose@@ dly defended themselves well . &quot;
then I cri@@ ed :
how can you say good@@ bye to me ?
I have seen how you killed people !
&quot; you are terrible crimes , and you have forced me as a child to participate . &quot;
he ref@@ used only &quot; Na then I left me . &quot;
this is exactly what I did .
in 2010 I started the first ad .
I had finally recognised that he was a criminal .
nobody can blame me that I have heard bi@@ ased . I finally told against my own father .

a translation error makes older people in Kyoto too &quot; fright@@ ful car drivers &quot;
&quot; the sign with the translator error in a centre in Kyoto , where one can extend its leadership . &quot;
the photo was common in social media .
processing of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened center in which one can extend its leadership , in the last month witnesses of a very special bl@@ iss@@ ful translation . &quot;
&quot; on a sign the Japanese word was used as &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; , &quot; the &quot; older drivers &quot; means , fal@@ si@@ bly - perhaps even with Bohem@@ ian h@@ itch &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; fe@@ ar@@ able mot@@ orists &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the incorrect translation was from 1st to 20th September to electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
editing the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine which was often shared in social media .
&quot; the error was the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ otos , which was also attentive to the local time of local time . &quot;
the Kyoto Newspaper Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an ins@@ ult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable , &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot;
&quot; the faul@@ ty English translation was first removed . the name &quot; &quot; drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; fe@@ ar@@ able mot@@ orists &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate form if also gram@@ mati@@ cally not quite correct term &quot; &quot; El@@ der drivers &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the police of the Pre@@ fecture Kyoto are sorry for the translator @-@ mistake . furthermore , they declared that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation has not been checked for their correctness before it was published . &quot;
a blog@@ ger reported as follows on the exc@@ use :
&quot; we are sorry that older people felt through the insufficient correction ( the translation ) of our turn , &quot; said the police . &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News sat down somewhat more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; terrible &quot; was ran@@ ced as in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police there are the proportion of older drivers , the land@@ ed far in accidents , but quite occasion for concern . &quot;
&quot; in the Pre@@ fecture Kyoto , for example , in 2005 1.@@ 9@@ 41 was caused by a total of 19.@@ 460 accidents . this corresponds to a percentage of 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , caused seniors 1.8@@ 03 from a total of 11.@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
&quot; by doing so , their share rose to 17,@@ 7 % . &quot;
&quot; while the number of accidents in total has decreased , the proportion of the elderly has risen in the same period . &quot;
&quot; the nam@@ eless not mentioned re@@ por@@ ters brought back to Yahoo released version of the article comments to the light , which indicate which pre@@ judi@@ ces some Japanese apparently circul@@ ating against older mot@@ orists : &quot;
&quot; the article on Yahoo via the translator error , among other things , the following comments : &quot;
- &quot; Is this ( &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; ) is not the reality ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; so , the translation is actually not at all , or ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t find that this is a real translation error . &quot;
there are not few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gra@@ ish &quot; across Asia is so widespread
translation errors are widespread in Japan and Asia .
the website En@@ gra@@ ish@@ .com is a true @-@ stop for these bizarre errors in English .
photo by Flick@@ r @-@ User Andrew .
the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are mani@@ fold .
you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the output text and active language skills to transfer it into the target language .
&quot; the latter requires the active master@@ y of the target language - something that is in mater@@ nity in the case . in general , the conviction that translators is in the target language - not in the output language - mother@@ language should be . &quot;
thus a French mother tongue should translate into the example from English into French - not from the French into English .

&quot; many Japanese companies do not employ workers with English as a native language , the translations into English . this may respond to faul@@ t@@ ingly understanding of the su@@ prem@@ acy , quotation or the relatively small number of German native speakers , the Japanese language . &quot;
&quot; some companies that have no foreign employees , let translations are nevertheless un@@ finished . then the Japanese staff , whose English knowledge will be judged as the best - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are . &quot;
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ User Karl Baron .
automated translations are also widespread - often with funny results .
the wor@@ r@@ ative and pu@@ zz@@ ling phrases created by the automated translations that this technique cannot replace a human translator . this applies to some languages especially .
&quot; some of the strange English formulations in Japan , including the pu@@ zz@@ ling prints , which often used T @-@ shirts or bags , are used only for stylish reasons - not to be read or understood . &quot;
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ User Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation error may be as a jewelry yet acceptable or at least harm@@ less . but by large companies or from the government that have the means to ensure higher standards , you can find careful translations . &quot;
the city of Kyoto uses a serious source for their translations into the future .
Venezuela : protests and Z@@ ens@@ ur@@ ers take on the Internet and TV

&quot; later , other users wrote that the Internet pres@@ ences of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ oli@@ o TV are no longer accessible . &quot;
also other online transmitter transm@@ its recordings of the protests in Car@@ acas which were organized by op@@ posi@@ tional groups that contradi@@ ct the government of Nicol@@ Ã¡s Ma@@ du@@ ros .
&quot; the protests began in the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court began to dis@@ solved the Parliament and the tasks of the parliament had to be transferred to the executive and the Supreme Court itself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tr@@ ac@@ er@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection is chew@@ ed , and received the U@@ AR , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet . &quot;
# Zen@@ sur : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet sites of Venezu@@ el@@ an Provider is once again locked .
this is from the side of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with the Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access especially in times of un@@ rest .
&quot; traditional media have been reported in 2014 with reporting about protests . at that time , the Commission for telecommunications to them with money and closing times , if they continue to report about demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as &quot; call to violence &quot; . &quot; &quot;
without cable TV and informative national television channels I have signed up again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
amazing that this continues to be cheaper than two liters of Lim@@ on@@ ade .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ er@@ tro confirmed later that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay by a block of the domain name System ( DNS ) is in@@ accessible , but also two further online stations . this also concerns the website , on which the National Assembly carries out their meetings . &quot;
&quot; former post @-@ ups of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had found that the local internet provider will benefit DNS BE . this is a technique that fails to answer the DNS @-@ server requests of particular domains . &quot;

&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it was also reported that the government regul@@ ates the Internet connections : thus the Venezu@@ el@@ ans have access to a multi@@ medi@@ al reporting of the current events in the country ever further . &quot;
in Paraguay many girls become slaves to get a vocational training
Tina Al@@ var@@ enga was as a child a Cri@@ ad@@ ita . now she visited the house where she worked for years .
&quot; today , Tina is fighting for the rights of children and g@@ athers testim@@ onies from other Cri@@ ad@@ itas , which were precisely how they were victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;
photo of Cec@@ ilia Ro@@ jas . use with kind permission of curiosity .
&quot; the following article is the shorten@@ ed version of a report by Kur@@ ling , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of authors . &quot;
&quot; this article is part of a series with the title &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ elas que CAEN &quot; ( &quot; F@@ ite cows , ver@@ aging schools &apos; ) that is edited and re @-@ published by Global Vo@@ ices in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ enga lived eight years in a household , where they did not live together with the family who lived there , eat . &quot;
&quot; shortly before her studies at the University , she returned to the house again and heard , like the owner of the house full of pride about she said . &quot; &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot;
&quot; the one has become something &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ enga has never been treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old , she began to work as Cri@@ ad@@ ita for the family . as Cri@@ ad@@ itas , one described in Paraguay the more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the shop is quite simple : a big family with little money sur@@ passes their min@@ ent son or her min@@ ent daughter to another , abundant family . in exchange , the child receives food , a training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; however , however , it is not mentioned that the children can afford to do countless days house@@ work , who will never be paid and sacrific@@ ing the victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a treaty which you cannot lift . &quot;
this as Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go describes practice is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organizations .
Al@@ var@@ enga worked a few years for an organization dedicated to the rights of boys and girls .
&quot; and she spoke with Cri@@ ad@@ itas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go - sam@@ pled stuff , research@@ ed and p@@ ran@@ ger@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; they tried to call things on behalf of the name , because the feeling of gratitude to the Cri@@ ad@@ itas is vacc@@ inated , guaranteed in general silent . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ enga . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family that their daughter will close their daughter to their faith , improve their position in society and make something out of itself , to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family , which decre@@ ases the girl with himself and whose exploitation agree with the faith that they would give someone a chance that would have no education or maybe even star@@ ring . &quot;
the victims of the Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go
&quot; when the girl is mis@@ leading , his family will experience only a lot of years later . &quot;
sometimes they never experienced it .
&quot; in January 2016 the so far was relatively un@@ familiar phenomenon that takes place in sec@@ recy in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n was to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº in the hospital , her body showed traces of fier@@ ce battles . shortly afterwards she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the household of the former militar@@ ist Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo who works as officials of the population .
&quot; Mar@@ Ã­n lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometres to the east of As@@ unci@@ on . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 Fer@@ re@@ ira continued until with a stick on Mar@@ Ã­n , until they suffered fat@@ al injuries . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of a young girl .
some days later the media reported on the inci@@ dent .
they stressed that the mur@@ dered child was a Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
organizations like UNIC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deep in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Society inter@@ r@@ ally responsible for the death of the girl .
it marked the cri@@ ti@@ z@@ go as &quot; a modern form of sla@@ very . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protests and demanded that there is no other Carolina in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widespread in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay are more cows than children registered , &quot; def@@ endant Tina Al@@ var@@ enga . &quot;
&quot; without Pap@@ ers , it is much easier to hurt the rights of children . &quot;
&quot; without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbors of the couple and nearly 60 civil@@ ised social organisations demanded a quick investigation of the case .
&quot; they want the Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl , which was their Cri@@ ad@@ ita , sentenced to 30 years in prison . &quot;
&quot; if the case is coming from judgment , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n rich@@ ly be evidence - if the first time in the history of Paraguay is a case of Cri@@ p@@ z@@ go . &quot;
the everyday life of a Cri@@ ad@@ ita
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ itas are not only exploited as labour force , they also live isolated from other girls in their age . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ enga was ten years old when the far@@ ars entered into her father , she had to sign up and her father lost his work . &quot;
&quot; their brothers had to go to work all and began to sell on the street , or on the market sweets for making money . &quot;
but they went all further to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ on in the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
in the house of her employer Al@@ var@@ enga worked between four and six hours every day .
&quot; in doing so , she had to share the time so that you still have time to learn . &quot;
she was prepared for her employer every morning and prepared the breakfast for their employers .
&quot; Fri@@ days for example clean@@ eth the fridge , pl@@ aster the living room , the furniture and disinf@@ ecting the ground . &quot;
when the school was at the end she went home again and had time to learn .
&quot; the more it was finished with learning , the more free time had it . &quot;
&quot; but even this time was limited , because they had to make dinner for their employers . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ var@@ enga says , she never had to go hungry , but also did not get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to pick up more books from the library of the house as food from the fridge , &quot; it re@@ members . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belon@@ ged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal Party , which was at power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; in some evenings , the house Al@@ var@@ enga , next to him stand and editorial from Op@@ position@@ ists like &quot; &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; El Pueb@@ lo &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , he tried to convince them to give the reports of the official media about the regime of the dict@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; he held it for intelligent , but not with her . &quot; &quot; the landlord had found someone who spoke about politics , while he spoke about politics , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they allowed me not often to visit my family because they were the opinion that I would like to learn there again &quot; bad habit , who belong to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ , at home again their native language Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ . &quot;

in January 2015 a woman published the following text in a Facebook group in which you can share vac@@ ation@@ ers for cleaning personnel and n@@ anny in Paraguay .
&quot; administr@@ ators in the group is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a municipality of As@@ unci@@ on in the district of As@@ unci@@ on . &quot;
hello ! I am looking for a small companion for my little daughter who plays in the morning and in the afternoon with her .
learning .
please d@@ ressed to you .
start from Monday when possible .
the display got five &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the place Ã@@ em@@ by wrote that she would have a full @-@ year girl and gave their phone number .
&quot; another woman who also came from Ã@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; &quot; wrote them . &quot;
&quot; in the third commentary was written by &quot; &quot; a girl from the inland , which I want to work . &quot;
then the editor of the display was once again a :
&quot; dear friends , I have found a lot . I look , whether it works with her . &quot;
&quot; thank you , I write it again when something is . &quot;
the business was completed .
in the pro@@ log to the report Cri@@ ad@@ itas , Â¿ H@@ asta cu@@ Ã¡n@@ do ? &quot;
&quot; ( Cri@@ ad@@ itas , as long as long ? ) , a collection of stuff , former Cri@@ ad@@ itas , writes or@@ ti@@ z : &quot;
&quot; in the course of our history , we managed to create systems such as sla@@ very , Cu@@ Ã±@@ ada@@ z@@ go ( an economic system during the Spanish conquest , where the Spanish con@@ quer@@ ors were sent to them ) and the system of Men@@ s@@ Ãº ( in which the workers ) had to do . therefore , that many girls and boys must go into a system of sla@@ very , where they will become light victims for abuse and exploitation . &quot;
the social inequality in Paraguay and the to the s@@ au of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon as a cri@@ ti@@ z@@ go .
legisl@@ ations writes the Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

&quot; six@@ ty , Egyptian parliam@@ ent@@ arians have recently agreed a bill &apos;s throw to &quot; the regul@@ ators with regard to the second @-@ use and usability of social networks . &quot;
&quot; if he accepted by the Parliament , users must register with social media in Egypt at a government authority in order to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law then , a job would then be set up , which is charged with citizens a permission to implement social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months with the acceptance of the law , user &apos;s user would have to register with their correct name and human resource numbers to be able to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; will it dre@@ aming that , this could bring a penalty up to six months of shaft or cash . &quot;
&quot; the draft law which consists of six Par@@ agrap@@ h and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application , which runs on the Internet and used to communicate with others using the voice , vide@@ on@@ ach@@ ment and text . &quot;
&quot; it is un@@ clear how the law is set when it is assumed , since the draft is no indication of how the Egyptian authorities can rise to registration . un@@ clear is also how they do not register the fact that the Egyptian government is unable to ensure regulation on the level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul saddle , parliamentary sc@@ anners and promot@@ ers of the Legisl@@ ative Dec@@ ree , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered user coun@@ cil@@ ors and a password to come through the fire@@ wall to get the Facebook blocks . &quot;
&quot; this could mean that Egypt is planning , a fire@@ wall at national level around Facebook . due to which it would be necessary for the Egyptians , and Egyptians , to submit information on their identity to access the network . &quot;
but it is not known so far that such plans exist .
experts on site are sc@@ ep@@ tical on the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Technolog@@ ist ( in German &quot; &quot; scientific research officer &quot; ) the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
&quot; I turn to the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things , who have to do with technology . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion , they introduce it to the physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; when I take them seriously , then means that they will establish a strong surveillance system to ex@@ clude citizens who request a permit or not . and that means a mad@@ ness system to monitor the activities of people and also to take them to a judicial process . &quot;
this is technically by no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; to be passed as a law , the draft must first be discussed in the legislative framework and constitutional committees , before it enters the plenary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether its acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft &quot; stands out in line with a pro @-@ military mind@@ ful in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and ensured that no separate ten@@ ration is present on the image area , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , the Parliament &apos;s president Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y has been en@@ vis@@ aged against cy@@ ber crime against cy@@ ber crimin@@ ality in which a li@@ fel@@ ong li@@ tigation for those intended to be found guilty of &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot; &quot;

why is this particular kind of le@@ op@@ ards so important ?
&quot; as R@@ aza shows in the video , the Persian Leopard provides the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ ory in the Kur@@ dish ecos@@ ystem &quot; and the health and the memorial &apos;s ecos@@ ystem also depends on that a large car@@ ni@@ tier is available . &quot;

&quot; in the beginning of March 2017 , known for the Nor@@ the@@ ast of Japan , Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o , the progress made in the last six years have been affected by the &quot; &quot; Triple catastrophe &quot; &quot; of March 2011 . a vast earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a had triggered the disaster . &quot;
&quot; the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ da@@ i , which is located in the Pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . the Pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was the pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , which had to experience the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami . &quot;
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and neighbouring countries Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to disappear all coastal cities of the map .
&quot; yet , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a a nuclear accident , already alone had to leave their homes as well as 160 000 inhabitants . &quot;
the special report of the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o shows from a local point of view which progress has been achieved after six years to rebuild the lives of the resident .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of Japanese re@@ building and survey results of those concerned themselves .
&quot; apartment construction in Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper reported that until December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement houses ( champion protein , Ju@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei a@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in the Pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate completed . &quot;
&quot; the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures was able to record mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , here 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were finished . &quot;
I@@ w@@ ate has finished 75 percent of such houses where Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a has 70 percent of the closing light .
&quot; however , you still tried to spend six years after the catastrophe , ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated of housing accommodations ( champion protein , cas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in final replacement parts . &quot;
after the triple @-@ catastrophe almost 80 000 people were forced to live in housing accommodations .
&quot; in December 2016 still 36 000 people were living from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a and I@@ w@@ ate in such housing . &quot;
&quot; almost 40 per cent of the year 2011 Ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a live successfully in emergency , which was more than 75 percent of the ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated , which were re@@ located after the des@@ aster in housing estate , were settled in final homes . &quot;
for I@@ w@@ ate the number here is 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected Pre@@ con@@ tours
&quot; as the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper could determine , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , which were affected by the un@@ happiness , its doors up to December 2016 , which makes almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot;
six years later the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ fabri@@ cation are far more difficult .
&quot; during almost 100 percent of fisheries ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i now again in operation , have recorded its operation at Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a only 30 percent of the fisher@@ y . &quot;
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atomic accident occurred in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures agricultural land @-@ weak@@ ly in compassion .
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i managed to recover 93 percent of its agricultural land , whereby only 66 percent of the agricultural land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed A@@ cker@@ land can be used again in Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a . &quot;
&quot; it is un@@ likely that this is only a result of atomic fact , because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares destroyed A@@ cker@@ land of Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a , are located in the nuclear pro@@ cession . &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has far recovered from tourism , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a far away . &quot;
the tourist target in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are back to 90 percent on the same stand as before the un@@ happiness . Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a on the other hand can only have 75 per cent here .
&quot; however , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe nearly half of the coastal inhabitants , it is more difficult to earn their li@@ vel@@ i@@ hood . &quot;
is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
&quot; to find a total image , the paper introduced numerous surveys under the native people and among the ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated by . she asked about the state of re@@ building and also how their sensation across the ts@@ un@@ ami risk has changed . &quot;
in their introduction of the article the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper :
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o led a survey conducted by more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness under the local population .
the survey brought that 8@@ 3.1 percent of the resident citizens have taken to be prepared to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
&quot; however , 55.@@ 9 per cent of the respon@@ dents that was still not done enough in terms of disasters prevention . &quot;
how to get those who had ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated from the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a
&quot; in its edition to the anniversary of the earthquake , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper has its attention to the location of the ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a had to experience not only the huge earthquake and devast@@ ating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a was also witness of the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic injuries , atomic fact that Japan ever had to experience . &quot;
&quot; of 160 000 ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a , almost 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 , a little more than 23 000 people were moved back to Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a , in permanent spare parts . &quot;
after the state of 2017 there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a outside her native pre@@ fecture .
&quot; in the disaster areas most of the ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated areas are most of the ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated hausen , which need to return in proper housing , because the effort for reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a have to compete with massive building projects . here is the construction projects that are taking place in Tokyo by 2020 . &quot;
the world is small : our Pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; when one encounters human beings from other countries , the differences appear to be larger than the simil@@ arities seem to be larger than the simil@@ arities . &quot;
&quot; however , after a while one often recogni@@ zes that a more connecting more than it appears at first sight . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important as they challenge our pre@@ judi@@ ces , expand our prospects and remind us that the world is ultimately very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look exactly these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we treat topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve . &quot;
we speak to five Global Vo@@ ices members who have at a moment in which they have felt very strongly inter@@ connected with someone over language and country borders .

a Bra@@ si@@ lian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week into the intensive care station : last Friday it had be@@ aten him during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with a stroke against the head . nationwide adopted millions of prot@@ esters at a Protest@@ ant against austerity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , the Social Sciences studied at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , has suffered a sk@@ ull @-@ deer and several fr@@ ac@@ tures . &quot;
doctors operated him on this Saturday and now have moved him into an artificial Kom@@ a .
his condition is regarded as critical .
the local image of Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus which quickly spread within a few days quickly in Brazil .
in the pictures the face of the police officers is also identified with a stroke attack . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
&quot; after the inci@@ dent , the military police were known in the Brazilian state Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o has been rep@@ lied to the conclusion of the study of the inci@@ dent of the active service . &quot;
the pictures show the police officers in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with his stroke to the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( Photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
would be a polishing of a prot@@ esters in a prot@@ esters and land in the Inten@@ sive River , his face would be able to see six months in television and the whole oppression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook @-@ Page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media acti@@ vi@@ sts from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , divided by Lu@@ iz da Luz recorded by Lu@@ iz , in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officers and several san@@ itation shortly afterwards to him . &quot;
&quot; another video with the same scenes , but from another perspective is also fil@@ med in social networks . &quot;
in the shown clip one sees the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus who lives in another federal state , Internet bad@@ gers now lives 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( approximately 2,@@ 700 euro ) to cover a part of the cost of the medical treatment and to stay in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , while he is in hospital . &quot;

&quot; Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s experiences a wave of political force : here , the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ h@@ erm@@ e joined forces in secondary schools . here was the military police force of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who has been attacked by a police station , having been attacked by a polic@@ eman , who has be@@ aten him with a stroke . &quot;
language : German
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only state in Brazil in which it came on the last Friday for brut@@ al police approaches against demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; polic@@ emen in protest in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had er@@ ected a stage for Red@@ ner , rubber , and tr@@ Ã¤n@@ eng@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the representative Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police via loud@@ speakers to ref@@ rain from violence against demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; this includes also a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the whole country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media street prot@@ ru@@ pted by getting the focus on another , unexpected prot@@ ag@@ onists : a window @-@ screen . &quot;
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo told specifically about a cerem@@ onial glass window to design with a photo of their titles : illustr@@ ative .
&quot; at the contrary , the O Glo@@ bo preferred a title story with a brand new bus . &quot;
&quot; there is no pl@@ au@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a broken window than about the protests of thousands of people who serve the defence of a special matter . &quot;
&quot; this must also be acknowle@@ dg@@ ement , if you are strictly against any form of damage . &quot;
&quot; here also here , the term &quot; &quot; Vand@@ alism &quot; &quot; is a absurd , dis@@ proportion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violence of the military police are dism@@ issed by headlines with the title &quot; demonstr@@ ators on con@@ front@@ ational relations with the police &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the un@@ indu@@ str@@ apping villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Ã@@ l@@ var@@ o Re@@ yn@@ oso almost hundreds of sugar mills in all over Cuba ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the People &apos;s Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , which is located in the Western Cub@@ an province of May@@ abe@@ que - is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar , regardless of that there is no not@@ able sugars on site . &quot;
it is two years ago as the activities placed in the sugar cane mol@@ ds .
&quot; after receiving the sugar cane sugar in the region still , and the factory lost according to and according to his plants , until only the sm@@ ells from steel and concrete . &quot;
about 272 workers had to find themselves new .
some alter@@ nate the work .
other re@@ signed and p@@ end@@ ons daily to the factories that are still ma@@ hlen .
&quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , which is scre@@ wed every day at 4 : 00 a.m. , the crisis in the sugar cane industry did not smoke his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that in the east of the region of sugar lo@@ gs , which are again in operation after a long time , because they were preserved . &quot;
that was something he was not expecting .
&quot; N@@ ails remember exactly that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich would receive the sugar cane , but the promise was not kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar cane industry has already resi@@ sted the pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , the low market efficiency , the in@@ effic@@ ien@@ cies and climate change . &quot;
&quot; 2016 the production of 1.9 million tons of sugar , less than the 1910 produced . &quot;
&quot; the message would have been a mot@@ if for the country some decades ago , but the bad har@@ v@@ ests are already no new . &quot;
why was the Cub@@ an sugar cane ?
the old train line of the church saw better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane mol@@ ds were technically ver@@ out@@ dated , and hardly competitive they were un@@ portable for the country . &quot;
the initial idea was to focus the production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tons . &quot;
they only left the factories that can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
&quot; the moti@@ fs that led to such measures were the low productivity of the sugar cane plant@@ ations , and the sugar rise on the world market . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar rose before about a decade back . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar exists between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 published report &quot; Land@@ sc@@ arc@@ tic spec@@ tives &quot; of the OECD and FA@@ O , the agricultural and nutrition organization of the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; if the current production of 2001 would achieve the level of 2001 ( 3,@@ 6 million tonnes ) , the pipe production would be around â¬ 85 million for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go into history , that was the first words of the Cub@@ an President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugars factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
&quot; from there , the restructuring process began in the sugar industry . &quot;
&quot; in the following years the stagn@@ ation of 98 sugars fabri@@ ken came , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further training . &quot;
the same happened in the sugar cane Factory Gregori@@ o Ar@@ l@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez has been working in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; if N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , the closing of the factory speaks , is the Word , which he is most repeated , &quot; fraud . &quot;
nearly all inter@@ ro@@ dents are of the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory was breast@@ feeding .
&quot; in order to get the place , they formed a full time - working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first year , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; it was officially copied documents that would only be removed in relation to the parts , which would be removed , the Ad@@ res@@ sat and the date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the ministers was able to make any un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; from there , the responsibility was over and the letters have always been more common . &quot;
&quot; Juan Carlos River@@ o was in charge for two years for the still@@ ed factory and he was one who received the letters . &quot; &quot; the country had no money for those in operation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for the retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was opposed to his will in the stagn@@ ation of the factory , in whose construction he helped . &quot;
&quot; with each part , that he removed , dismant@@ led one of his 31 years of work . &quot;
the developed industrial area developed by Cuba and the most important work producers has been eliminated .
&quot; in many cases , there were no alternatives for working and services that were generated systems in the communities where they found themselves . &quot;
&quot; we will never know if during the Mam@@ mut speech of 21 October 2002 , the dam@@ p president in the eyes of the present people saw , when he guaranteed , that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation , everything would run well . &quot;
the price of the population for the closing of the sugars
since 2004 Su@@ gar@@ tube is only extr@@ acted high through ma@@ hlen .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; after two years the People &apos;s Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich took that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar cane is closed , or better said , when they began , they dism@@ issed them , they also list@@ ened to the road , this dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy other factories had to look . &quot;
they were shared with replacement parts .
&quot; without future spec@@ tive , many young people left the region . &quot;
&quot; in the area , a food factory was created , whose production is not even for the care of the congregation . &quot;

first Nations young@@ sters use Hip Hop in order to express and maintain their own culture

&quot; youth of the First Nations communities in Canada are dealing with topics that are important for them . they do they do with Hip Hop , thanks to a number of walking workshops . &quot;
&quot; as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour , bringing mobile recordings directly to schools and youth centers , in order to contribute to youth groups of son@@ g@@ writing , recording , audio and video production . &quot;
&quot; the original workshops were led by the Pe@@ dago@@ gues David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and in North @-@ Que@@ bec with ten cre@@ e communities and then working with the Cre@@ e Hip Hop group The North@@ Stars . &quot;
&quot; the workshop is thus increasing that young participants in discussions such as cultural identity , language , dispute , love , self @-@ payments , or whatever of them comes into mind . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the W@@ inn@@ eb@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos;s Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia explains the history of the Highway 16 , also &quot; Highway of the te@@ ars , in which almost two dozen young women disappeared or mur@@ dered . &quot;
the cases were mostly not clari@@ fied .
&quot; the next video of the Nem@@ aska Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motive of a video player to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs , despite the influence of globalization . &quot;
&quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people will not always prevail in the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation recorded the ref@@ rain on Cre@@ e sang .
the young people involved here got some help from Gary Jol@@ ly from the North@@ stars Hip Hop Group which gave them a st@@ rop@@ he in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
&quot; on the fac@@ ebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an is available the St@@ rop@@ he in tran@@ script , as well as a translation into English , which is translated here into German : &quot;
sometimes I feel like would not ever be interested in me
but I try to go on my days on earth
that is the day when you take our cry
because we as youth have lost our way in life
yet I believe that we will rise up for one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
&quot; in this way , they can grow and go out as well as our youth . &quot;
&quot; so , they can do what they are determined by the Creator . &quot;
&quot; in the commentary , the reader and champ@@ ions of the Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also has a post and adds the st@@ rop@@ he published in Sil@@ ben@@ au ( which is also published on his blog and will be re@@ published here with permission ) : &quot;

in Japan one can see almost every restaurant of plastic dishes .
&quot; to show potential customers , what exactly are on the menu , are displayed close to the entrance sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( within the same class , &quot; &quot; plastic models of the dishes &quot; ) of each Spe@@ ise , which is served in this restaurant . &quot;
the customers see these plastic @-@ dishes and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic @-@ dishes .
&quot; in the Tokyo &apos;s Tok@@ ab@@ ashi , there is a variety of these small companies that produce those plas@@ tic dishes prepared by the German film@@ makers Wim Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than twenty years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most of Japanese , these plastic @-@ dishes are as usual that they are not even more noticeable in them . however , a new trend is transformed today in striking cell accessories and other gad@@ gets . &quot;
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ oms the B@@ log@@ ger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos that show this unusual tw@@ ist with the sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new with plastic @-@ align@@ ed mobile hinges on how to be shown in K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu Kauf@@ haus .
&quot; many of these artificial foods were turned to kit@@ es anth@@ ologies , as in this case , cooling cabinet magnets : &quot;
here are a few sho@@ ck@@ out cooler magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom of the ess@@ ay is becoming increasingly rec@@ essed .
in this case a ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular travel handle with seafood ) into a mobile th@@ rot@@ ary .
we have found a good use for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) .
we also have produced this part for the exhibition in Tokyo .
and here is an apple that cap@@ es your mobile .
&quot; designed to watch like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and that is just the beginning of an increasing flight .
&quot; some mobile phone @-@ stands and mobile phone @-@ designers allow you to manufacture your own artwork . in this case , ik@@ ura and sal@@ mon is used , a popular T@@ opp@@ y which is served with white rice . &quot;
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; are there someone who would say , &quot; Wow , cool , now I can scre@@ ed my mobile phone with sal@@ mon ? &quot;
I think I will probably be the one .
&quot; this interest in Plas@@ tik@@ har can also assume a less appe@@ tizing form to surprise for example colleagues or family members . &quot;
our latest mobile phone stand has the form of mel@@ ting ice .
&quot; in addition , there are also travelling balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , ear@@ rings and hand@@ bags of dried sal@@ mon . &quot;
further sc@@ ul@@ r@@ ile plastic dishes can be seen at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ oms blog post . or follow on Twitter to the has@@ ht@@ ag # 17.30 .
&quot; if you would like to know more about the origin of this trend , then this video gives you an insight into the Capp@@ ab@@ ashi , which is dedicated to the ventilation of the restaurant industry . as for example with the sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes can actually be produced .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survi@@ vor@@ s of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the struggle against drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; in reports in@@ - and foreign media on the arch@@ ers &quot; struggle against drug dealers &quot; in Mexico , the missing and wo@@ unded regularly only in statistics . however , they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy , which brings this battle with itself . &quot;
&quot; the reporting on drug bos@@ ses like El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , the Chief of Sin@@ alo@@ a @-@ Kart@@ ell , the stories of the victims of the conflict completely in the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent inci@@ dent , someone looks at the mo@@ urn or on the municipalities that have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; there are behind every corp@@ ses , behind every coff@@ ees in the hundreds of heated tom@@ bs , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wo@@ unds may never be healing . &quot;
&quot; that is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico offers the digital project &quot; &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vivi@@ r C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; with the drug &quot; &quot; live &quot; &quot; ) to live these sacrific@@ es and stories by people who have turned into the struggle between the pro@@ secution authorities and cart@@ els . &quot;
Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico describes the project so :
organised crime can not only be used to fear our lives .
the effects are much more profound .
&quot; for example , if business close , because they are threatened by drugs , and all con@@ greg@@ ations need to drive many kilometres to buy something like milk . &quot;
pain of the victims
a video with the title &quot; vi@@ das que c@@ ambi@@ an p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; as fear life changed &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
&quot; a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father , which got secret tom@@ bs after his son . &quot;
&quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ gu@@ ez , who lost their four brothers , their four sisters , their husband and two of their ne@@ phe@@ w . &quot;
&quot; priests : &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves today again on the task that we have put ourselves to go and to gra@@ ves , after the people we have loved . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Contr@@ as : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Contr@@ as Mat@@ a .
&quot; he was 28 , when he disappeared . &quot;
he has three children .
he worked in a home shop in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on October 13 he left the house .
&quot; on 15 October he should be back again , but he never came again . Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it is very hard for me , for I am alone with three children who need a training . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , which is also here with me . &quot;
at the moment she has no income .
&quot; you are entering the insurance of my Father , but who do not get them out , because that require a mort@@ ality . &quot;
where should we get that ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vi@@ vir con el nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we do not only have to show the faces of those who are of fear . we must show the international community to show conflicts , the frag@@ ility and governance . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports from journalists in Hoch@@ ris@@ iko @-@ areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ HB , a Re@@ aders of Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the federal state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central West . &quot;
&quot; your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal , regardless of what form it occurs : &quot;
I know the disease and sens@@ ing journ@@ alism now for several years .
I come over every day at newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the front pages with pictures that actually can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from acts of specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
&quot; sometimes I have the feeling as if I am the un@@ p@@ aced , which is wi@@ ped or sad . it works as a lack of respect towards the person who once belon@@ ged to this body . &quot;
I can &apos;t be indifferent to it or consider this as normal .
it says further :
&quot; no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year C@@ ous@@ in thinks that he wants to hear Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) if he is great . and it &apos;s not normal that people are songs on the &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of criminal proceedings , when they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me , this , as if they are tem@@ pting you to have lost , and those who have fear that they might have happened such a thing . &quot;
I see our weakness if stories to blo@@ om figures in a statistic will be dealt with .
the dec@@ ay of men is unbeliev@@ able for me when the death of six people and the mer@@ win@@ den@@ sing of 43 students are justified in a neighboring village that they were open .
I think they try to talk that they remain spar@@ ed from such trag@@ e@@ dies if they are not sti@@ r and silent .
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico @-@ Stadt wrote the article &quot; Four months of press@@ ors in the Haupt@@ stadt@@ distri@@ butes : how a family was recorded with threats , until the end not only destroyed the business but also their family apart . &quot;
you think of everything you have lost and because some people can change your whole life within just a few days .
&quot; pain over it never goes , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes back high if you are alone . &quot;
habits have changed ; phone numbers are also .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the further we are removed , the better . &quot;
it included her account with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they are kid@@ n@@ apped or death . &quot;
&quot; I asked myself in these terrible days , whether wines would solve my deep@@ ened feelings , but the answers is no , because I have forgotten how to we@@ pt . I have to learn to live with pain . &quot;
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : one of violence signed generation .
&quot; in the introduction , he asks questions on how : who car@@ es about the child of a missing woman and a man who was mur@@ dered by organised crime ? &quot;
how is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the dangerous city of Mex@@ ic@@ os ?
he is not like other boy of his age whose parents care about them .
br@@ yan is a sc@@ ise and he tells that he had to teach himself how to make a egg cook@@ er potatoes br@@ yan , Tor@@ till@@ as warm and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies which live with him . this is his name for the preparation of bottles with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells about the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every way of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for the whole life of violence and had to learn to live with it .
&quot; when he was five years old , one spoke to him that his mother have disappeared . &quot;
&quot; but this was not the day , where his childhood ended . &quot;
&quot; his childhood has been over two years before , when he saw just a few blocks from his home , the blo@@ ody corp@@ ses of his father , who had been shot by armed men from a passing car . &quot;
&quot; born as Br@@ yan , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez looked like this : &quot;
br@@ yan was born in 2006 as violence by organised crime and the fight against it with the already existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez .
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the endangered city in the world due to the number of mor@@ als according to the number of civil rights , and the government of the Government of the United States . &quot;
in 2010 alone the Prosec@@ ut@@ or 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to the cut 8.5 Mor@@ den per day .
&quot; these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of histor@@ ies , which leaves the organised crime in Mexico and penet@@ rate into the soul of the country . &quot;
&quot; only a few stories live in the face of new headlines . however , this project reminds us of those who we must not forget . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vivi@@ r C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; has brought the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data to life , whose objective is tor@@ tured there , the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug dealers , which has tor@@ tured in the last four decades , in intel@@ li@@ gible form . &quot;
if a picture is worth a thousand words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Flick@@ r @-@ User Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ strÃ¶@@ m ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this contribution and the pages that he linked are images on which violence is represented . &quot;
&quot; the fact check is important in a moment in which it &apos;s about to lift up a ru@@ m@@ ors , or un@@ lock a for@@ gery . &quot;
&quot; but how is the years after something the first time has occurred ? content in social media , no matter whether true or true , tend to exist . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s take this photo of a terrible accident , seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DR Congo ) . &quot;
&quot; since its first publication it was used dec@@ ep@@ tive , trag@@ e@@ dies that actually have occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; incorrect description of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dr@@ aft News - den@@ ies not the fact that there is abundant careful reporting about events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
it raises questions about our desire for images on messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a tank @-@ tank place in the village of San@@ ge in the East of the DR Congo , ki@@ pp@@ es around and explo@@ ded . thereby , 230 people came to live . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa has been negl@@ ected for years of years and thereby devast@@ ated . the streets in the region have become dangerous paths full of cream holes that were difficult to drive . &quot;
&quot; trag@@ ically , the tank @-@ car fell to the victim . &quot;
&quot; pap@@ mat@@ ors described a fire@@ ball , the du@@ tz@@ tive houses , including a cin@@ em@@ as in the vicinity , which was full of people who was full of the football championship . &quot;
houses disp@@ ers@@ ed and bo@@ iled corp@@ ses in the streets scattered .
many people were burned to the un@@ mist@@ ak@@ y .
a picture entitled &quot; This is Nigeria &quot; . from Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ User Mys@@ tical Mon@@ key , 12 . January 201@@ 5.@@ multiple photos of the inci@@ dent form the gray scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example for this .
&quot; it shows rows of glaz@@ ed body , which are mounted on the ground while people are watching . &quot;
&quot; but here , the story does not find its end . &quot;
&quot; over the years the same photo was recorded several times on social media , blogs and other platforms and may not be mis@@ understood in the context of the trag@@ e@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what and what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 the fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am the bor@@ dered Nig@@ er@@ ian villages B@@ aga and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
eye @-@ witnesses reported dr@@ as@@ tically by atro@@ cities on which they had to escape .
houses and shops were burned down and corp@@ ses in streets and bus@@ hes .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; nobody stayed back to count corp@@ ses , &quot; said one inhabitants to Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many were destroyed , shot or burned . &quot;
only by satellite images could only be depic@@ ted on the following period .
the occasion for the attack also remained un@@ solved but the arm@@ chair @-@ point in B@@ aga was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt to win the B@@ oko Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture of the DR Congo came back to when it was mis@@ diagnosed as evidence of the fact and the potential extent of the attack was presented :
this is Nigeria .
a mass@@ ac@@ re of 2.000 people took place in Paris two days after Paris .
you are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , these ab@@ usive use of the image from the DR Congo are only one in a number of mis@@ cellaneous descriptions ; Africa check has documented skills to Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
in all of these cases the image was taken as a cover for mass@@ ages .
&quot; yet another step further bring personal comments such as this example , the picture of the DR Congo are linked to sources of mass media related to arguments . &quot;
the picture of San@@ ge also entered into combination with the de@@ adly persecution of the Muslim Ra@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a flash , published by the United Nations those who were fle@@ e , r@@ ape , r@@ ape and et@@ ly dead , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported by violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , de@@ af po@@ sts such as the following , these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo are brought together : &quot;
&quot; this picture comes from an angry di @-@ Arab news page , which was mist@@ ak@@ enly maintained , the President of Myanmar was said , mon@@ ks and politicians could have participated in the ass@@ ass@@ ination of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to record this information . &quot;
&quot; the original contribution , on the last on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot;
&quot; other news organizations that AF@@ P as their source called n@@ knew , they also mis@@ diagnosed Th@@ ein His statement , but had not associated with the image from the DR Congo . &quot;
the worldwide range of false information
traces of these false peti@@ tions will suff@@ ice up to the years 2011 and 2012 and actually come from all over the world .
&quot; with a &quot; &quot; revers@@ ed photo search &quot; &quot; you can see how far information can exceed boundaries . &quot;
a revers@@ al picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found under 18.@@ 8 billion images ( status of 3 May 2017 ) 344 images found that the bes@@ ieg@@ ed picture of the DR Congo are very similar .
&quot; they come from a mixed private pages , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
&quot; some have passed incorrect reports , others have tried to dis@@ f@@ ade the counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; we have excluded some examples of the ab@@ used use and associated with the respective countries , based on which page they were published . thus , we want to be more clearly more clearly than through the language alone . &quot;

&quot; this post , which set itself to the members of the Russian @-@ orthodo@@ x community , clearly , that the picture of DR Congo has NOT present Muslims to kill the Christians . &quot;
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 . &quot;
this news page claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein His 2012 have been vac@@ ated that mon@@ ks and politicians involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims have been involved and brought the story with the image of San@@ ge .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture is still included in it .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this article from 2014 about students who were brought on by B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by now deleted , the Kath@@ ol@@ ische near New@@ Ã¡l@@ is@@ is Digital , has explicitly stated that the picture does not dates from the k@@ ill@@ ings , but it claims that there is a &quot; similar d@@ hi@@ ha@@ di@@ stic attack &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the image later in connection with the mass@@ ac@@ re of the B@@ oko Har@@ am from 2015 in circulation , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to res@@ ist that there were connections to Nigeria . &quot;

&quot; the picture of the DR Congo emerged , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ has@@ ht@@ ag , on and delet@@ es a discussion among Muslims according to the mass@@ ac@@ re of the B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the proposal on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to achieve that their communities were these events , the mut@@ u@@ dly found in the name of Islam , a greater attention . &quot;
United States , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the picture was we@@ ather@@ ed as a cover for the mass@@ ac@@ re of the B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times ret@@ we@@ et@@ et ) . but the messages that were connected with it , were in no religious context . &quot;
&quot; instead , the goal was to judge attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of the media reporting in comparison of Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
Vietnam ( ese ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message which sup@@ pose@@ dly had been written by a &quot; &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; &quot; over the Nig@@ er@@ ian mass@@ ac@@ re , in circulation , we put discussion , as this here on Vietnamese and explained it to fal@@ se@@ hood . &quot;
&quot; from the message which was included in the picture of the DR Congo , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ ine Mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; there are further confirmed examples of faul@@ ty use of the picture from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; other accounts , Ag@@ greg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the cap in G@@ rau ) , Tin@@ Eye also indicates , but are no longer re@@ trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
( data entry with URLs and time / dates of data exist on the web cra@@ w@@ ler and they disp@@ ose of image fil@@ ename in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
&quot; in all these cases , the picture appeared clearly after the original un@@ Ã¼ck of 2010 , the image will ultimately be a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and pictures
&quot; there are two strong topics or frames ( frag@@ ments ) that re@@ draw this po@@ sts . the first frame is focused on religion . &quot;
the photo was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the nar@@ r@@ ations of Christians through Muslims or - to defend the Muslims - the nar@@ r@@ ations of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how a African life is under@@ valued compared to a European or French life .
religion understand and the value human life is both important . therefore it &apos;s worth to examine how images are used in connection with these efforts .
&quot; however , a deeper question is what happens if readers cannot give this pictures longer faith . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are forty people who have un@@ int@@ enti@@ onal that water round a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; sug@@ ger this atmosphere of faul@@ ty and false information , that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and decor@@ ate it the actual Gre@@ ys of what actually happened in the DR Congo , in Nigeria and in Myanmar ? &quot;
the spread @-@ violent images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( here for example ) .
&quot; an argument is that the back of pictures of a past@@ ure is equivalent to the tragedy . then , these pictures are even demanded by the victims itself . &quot;
&quot; at the same time the concern is that violent images readers and spect@@ ators are des@@ ensi@@ vely giving them the ability to emp@@ athy , emp@@ athy , such as r@@ ape media to work in others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot to cap@@ tiv@@ ated portr@@ ay@@ als in the news media , the fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting . &quot;
&quot; Tech@@ n@@ ologists experiment experimenting with algorithms , to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; . you will have to think thoroughly about the situation where a picture suggests that , what actually could be dis@@ solved by the context or completely mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ous manner . &quot;
&quot; however , any investigation fal@@ con grants should also be considered as internationally they can . &quot;

a blog with the name Un@@ transl@@ atable ( such . insur@@ able ) endeav@@ ours to provide language thr@@ illing a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate at all .
such words are available in each language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
&quot; some of these uns@@ elling words are already well known ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others who are deeply ro@@ oted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ brakes . ) &quot;
but everyone is stub@@ born stub@@ born to every attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; a word or expression is sufficient , why a complete explanation and sometimes something context is required to understand exactly what is meant by that one word . &quot;
these unique words have already been collected for a long time in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ transl@@ atable &quot; Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages . &quot;
&quot; in the blog you can find example words from the Mw@@ ot@@ or language of V@@ anu@@ at@@ u , such as : &quot;
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Make yourself about your parents in recognition of it , how to try yourself in your younger years . &quot;
and words in H@@ uns@@ rik Language that are spoken in parts of Brazil as :
k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The convenience or la@@ zin@@ ess that you feel after having seen on cold days in the sun .
in Bir@@ ds own words from his blog about :
&quot; they de@@ fi@@ red other cultures , reve@@ aling other thoughts and aw@@ aken our new@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you can see how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page you want to publish more of these &quot; uns@@ ur@@ ably &quot; words and indicate how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are . &quot;
&quot; Red@@ ner of the &quot; Treasure Langu@@ ages &quot; , which are much appreciated by in@@ tox@@ ins are invited to upload their favorite words here . &quot;

&quot; use Author@@ ized in January , I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbouring and love friend . &quot;
&quot; I trust her four year old daughter , they famili@@ ari@@ ze me her children ; she is my F@@ els in the fire . &quot;
in one minute we call for a slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights .
in the next elections we defend rights for trans@@ gender .
&quot; we are in a sea of rain@@ forests and men , some keep the icon@@ ic image of a woman with head@@ sc@@ arf , bound up out of a American flag , others sk@@ ating Par@@ olen against Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend looks me and says : &quot; &quot; these things concern not you , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims , I ask . &quot;
I have already led these entertainment .
&quot; people , with whom I &apos;m working , people working me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar that they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built up in their performance . &quot;
they escap@@ ed me .
there are 1,@@ 7 billion Muslims around the world . &quot;
we do not see all the same .
we practi@@ se our religion differently .
&quot; we identify ourselves to be a Muslim , to different kinds . but somehow we will all put into the same Muslim drawer . &quot;
&quot; these drawer is well designed in our collective conception , that as soon as Muslims , which as I do not fit there , ent@@ re@@ ed . &quot;
to be mis@@ led
I do not work alone .
that &apos;s even to happen to the po@@ et whose poetry is sold in America : Rum@@ i .
which images come in mind when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; as a blinds in Rum@@ i as old as I am now , he was a orthodo@@ xer mus@@ li@@ fel@@ ine pre@@ acher and honor@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Quran and the Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the center of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the western idea , the religion of Rum@@ is was deleted , as well as the most popular translations of its poetry . &quot;
&quot; this del@@ etion makes a large part of the history of 1,@@ 7 billion Muslims of this world . &quot;
&quot; another consists of the reduction of Muslims , Western books has been colon@@ ised for centuries . &quot;
&quot; this tem@@ pting image language is determined by the dark man who should fear and the exotic woman , which you should save . &quot;
&quot; one of the Palestinian Palestinian scientist Edward S@@ aid , put the story behind these pictures in the 1970@@ s . &quot;
but these pictures are still further forward .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continues to continue . &quot;
&quot; I have worked for thir@@ teen years in the news industry and I have seen how this powerful , faul@@ ty Nar@@ r@@ ative domin@@ ate our new fe@@ eds . &quot;
&quot; this Nar@@ rati@@ v over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed the reality , which have led to nine Muslim women over the last three decades , while the United States could not even vote their first feminine presidential system . &quot;
&quot; this Nar@@ rati@@ v fails to acknowledge that when French , Muslim women are prevented from their head sc@@ arf in public buildings and forced to cover their entire body to cover their entire body , which are both two sides of the same coin . &quot;
a powerful group exercises his &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; other &quot; .
&quot; this strong Nar@@ rati@@ v weak@@ ens mus@@ cular women , the movements for change . &quot;
&quot; it looks that the first Muslim prayers were spoken in the American soil of Afri@@ kan@@ ers , who were hi@@ ther@@ ed with sla@@ ve . &quot;
it delet@@ es the existence of Que@@ er @-@ Muslims .
&quot; this Nar@@ rati@@ v has occupied our collective imagination , so deeply and lack@@ ed that often Sik@@ h @-@ men and children are to become the target of anti @-@ military attacks and tr@@ ail@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them is Islam@@ opho@@ bia today not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the other . &quot;
among the 1,@@ 7 billion are a part of the world . &quot;
&quot; in the news industry , we do more than just stories to tell which are based on facts . &quot;
or on alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ r@@ ative who help us understand the world .
&quot; and my industry is proj@@ ected to grasp the Nar@@ rati@@ v of 1,@@ 7 billion . &quot;
and we have failed here where seven million Muslims have the highest degree of &quot; diverse &quot; religious group in America .
more than one third of the total Muslim population are African Americans .
&quot; six out of ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants of the first generation , which origin@@ ates from 77 countries . &quot;

four decades ago my lon@@ ged parents came to live in New York to live their American dream .
&quot; my mother lay her first jewellery design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scrap@@ ers of New York , sky@@ scrap@@ ers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ c@@ ist of Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Kh@@ an . &quot;
&quot; at that time , when Kh@@ an was re@@ thinking about the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were unexpected Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I now un@@ wo@@ unds Muslims and Americ@@ an@@ erin ?
&quot; sometimes , when people wonder why I don &apos;t say por@@ k food , I say - instead of my mus@@ lim@@ bic recipes , or my hand@@ craf@@ ted Rhin@@ e@@ an that all Muslims bear in themselves - &quot; made out of respect for Pe@@ ppa W@@ utz . &quot;
&quot; I sh@@ ake , we do not bear all &quot; &quot; Rhin@@ oplast@@ y with us . &quot;
&quot; we must also be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; or to be always selected for additional safety checks at the airport . &quot;
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim gels , Muslim acti@@ vi@@ sts and inter@@ religious acti@@ vi@@ sts who endeav@@ our to fight far @-@ widespread lies on Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced by the ongoing band produced by a well @-@ appointed Islam@@ opho@@ bic machine with len@@ ders , Th@@ ink tanks and experts for mis@@ details , which is our already faul@@ ty picture of what a Muslim is ; or which Islam is , manipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of the kind we tell them , the hos@@ tility is in more than a stran@@ gers , who is sh@@ rou@@ gh@@ ed with a woman the head sc@@ arf . &quot;

I want to explain this .
&quot; I was born as Muslims , but a Muslim to be born then in my imagination , when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ i@@ anic Church in New York . &quot;
&quot; if social scientists describe religious life , they attack the following terms : faith , behaviour and belonging . &quot;
&quot; my mus@@ li@@ fel@@ ine faith and behaviour are perhaps not always visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; maybe my girlfriend , my neigh@@ bor , my neighbour in the fire that I am Muslims , when they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that our houses dis@@ connect . &quot;
&quot; it would see the om@@ ab@@ end@@ ent ritual with my daughter , when I have them in my arms , and ye have called the Arab verses to protect the Koran , and called the Q@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
each of them repeat three times .
&quot; so I ask that she is protected from evil , the evil one that one can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my mus@@ li@@ fel@@ ine is perhaps not always visible , but my mus@@ cular affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow . &quot;

&quot; belonging to my grand@@ mother , the image of my grand@@ mother is mater@@ nal , with their sisters , as they witness@@ ed a competition of the art of flower arrangements in Kar@@ achi . &quot;
&quot; it is the image of you that I can see in this moment when I close my eyes : Nano , surrounded by its completed and un@@ finished paintings , with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and eight capit@@ als , which it can nearly be maneu@@ ver@@ able . &quot;
&quot; Muslims to be Muslims , the prayers to speak that they had told me when I have a bad day . &quot;
&quot; Muslims , in it is how they brought me to relate to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people , that - over centuries - by an &quot; Empire &quot; col@@ oni@@ alised , which was founded a company with the name Ven@@ erable Bri@@ etic Ost@@ ini@@ sts Komp@@ anie , it has a deep meaning to name my only Lord . &quot;
the author in 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
&quot; belonging means to grow up and hear that men do not cry , but at the same time to see that my zu@@ sted grandfather we@@ pt . &quot;
&quot; spac@@ er , while he writes books on modern Islam and about independence K@@ ash@@ s , we@@ pt N@@ ana Ja@@ an un@@ um@@ ble around his family owned by India , K@@ ash@@ mir , family that he could not close into his arms in half a century . &quot;
&quot; belonging to know is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , their families , as with my grandfather , from col@@ oni@@ alists scattered around the Muslim world like at the game risk . &quot;
Muslims indeed means to know that in the last two centuries of Europeans all have been col@@ oni@@ alised to four Muslim countries .
it means knowing that the first plane bom@@ b of the story was rejected over a century about a Muslim land .
&quot; it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , an intimate , ash@@ mir sub@@ tan of the British empire , was known by the newspapers of his time as &quot; dangerous &quot; as he conducted the first mosque in England . &quot;
&quot; before there were aircraft , he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was and pre@@ ached the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;

&quot; to my Muslim tribe of the 1,@@ 7 billion go deep into our unforgettable rooms ; our un@@ covered history . &quot;
&quot; it means to remember that four years ago the most powerful army in the world , with troops , which were distributed across every continent apart from Ant@@ arc@@ tica , in Iraq , to im@@ itate mass destruction of weapons , which is not existed . &quot;
it means to know that more than half a million Ir@@ aker is buried among the ruins of the war .
an American Muslim to be aware that the self @-@ mor@@ row@@ ate under veter@@ ans since 2001 has risen by more than 32 per cent .
&quot; it means to know that when a tragedy has under@@ ne@@ ath the US and the susp@@ ects of a Muslim &apos;s name , the history of four times will be reported as a story with a white attack . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that four hundred years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liber@@ ated black slaves with the name Bil@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that two hundred years ago , an African Islam@@ ist named Bil@@ ali Muhammad reconc@@ iled and brought in this country . &quot;
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
&quot; it is the warmth that I pointed , as humans have crowded airports to fight against the Muslim B@@ an . &quot;
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we are saying black lives .
&quot; to be a Americ@@ an@@ erin , a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ erin , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Muslim and a journalist , the intimate inter@@ se@@ tion@@ ality of our with multi@@ thre@@ aded identi@@ fier , but to fail them to transmit them to others . &quot;
&quot; the Nar@@ rati@@ v of 1,@@ 7 billion bears more possibilities than a magic cub@@ es , but is represented in the reduction of two &quot; &quot; we &quot; against &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to be a mother to make me care of my child , and all mus@@ cular children , knowing that power@@ ing and privileged people on this two structural structural simil@@ arity . &quot;
&quot; structural xen@@ opho@@ bia consists in the Muslim Regi@@ str@@ ands , which began with President Bush and extended under President Obama . &quot;
it consists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
&quot; it consists of the immigrants , which takes a five years old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
it consists of a country that ex@@ cludes its borders towards people from just the countries that bom@@ bed it .
&quot; it is a false and neb@@ ul@@ ous &quot; No @-@ Fly &quot; list , &quot; which is largely Arabs and Muslims into the Vis@@ or . &quot;
&quot; they are the wars that we conduct , and the bom@@ bs that we have in Muslim countries . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of those who we are not telling , we are now here . &quot;
&quot; in a study with the title A@@ scent of Man , the scientists of the North@@ western University participants showed a scienti@@ fically described picture and b@@ aten them , groups on a scale of 1 to 100 on the evolution . &quot;
Muslims received the lowest score .
con@@ vers@@ ations that we have to lead
&quot; we are too deep dar@@ ing , to enth@@ ise the Muslim or the &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we have decades back to recognise the roots of our fears , and the faul@@ ty and dangerous sk@@ ies that we do in our news sections . &quot;

&quot; but I &apos;m worried because of this difficult global time , where we are . &quot;
and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.@@ 7 billion .
&quot; there is one reason that conspir@@ acy , which existed in the dark corners of the internet , now the White House now . &quot;
they have grown exp@@ on@@ entially because they have made Muslims to &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; there is another group that has grown exp@@ on@@ entially , by doing the &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
a couple of years ago she had not yet given them ; now they master large areas in Syria and Iraq .
&quot; I &apos;m worried about the re@@ alities and history which I was not aware of myself as I was as old as it &apos;s my daughter now , but who made me today to an un@@ found Muslims . &quot;
things that I left here like a bread cr@@ unch in my speech .
&quot; things that maybe wake memories , because in all the inter@@ sections that make our humanity like a story , where someone becomes a &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , take place in the context of the 8th annual conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; why do I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who has shown us like wars and humans to enth@@ used by the Sch@@ affen of the &quot; other &quot; in the public idea , four decades itself scientist of Stan@@ ford . &quot;
&quot; we must ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of how it is aware and un@@ aware of the &apos; other &apos; ; as the employment we present a new future , in which we have no president , the chocolate fish is bombar@@ ded , while he is already broken countries and &apos; to other done &quot; people bom@@ bed , far beyond the visible and invisible 1,@@ 7 billion . &quot;

can there be a possibility to contact someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Perry , founder of the Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) is the count of stories in their original language a possible response . &quot;
&quot; global Vo@@ ices reported in front of a different initiative by Steven Bird , the irre@@ plac@@ eable blog . &quot;
&quot; however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to get the language diversity of big cities and to pay . &quot;
&quot; in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has been conducted events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite so small languages cannot be passed on to the children there . &quot;
for the makers of the project :
&quot; the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided if we assume cities , bringing the diversity - safe spaces where citizens must not forget about who they are . &quot;
&quot; while &quot; listen often to &quot; &quot; understand &quot; &quot; for these events instead , &quot; listening to appreciate , to make to feel . &quot;
in this format the stor@@ yt@@ ellers form their story first in their own language and translate or explain them in English .
&quot; even if the participants are no professional stor@@ yt@@ ellers , they perform their devot@@ ion , and their depic@@ tion that the list@@ eners are introduced to it . &quot;
they call lau@@ gh and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
&quot; the following video shows for example a traditional history of Burk@@ ina Fas@@ o , which is told in language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou are also the opportunity to explain for their land typical customs of the nar@@ r@@ ative . &quot;
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the fast@@ ening of the rab@@ bit and the P@@ avian in the language sh@@ ona from Zim@@ babwe :
&quot; having asked the meaning of his works , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; &quot; how is that to speak to an audience , that your language does not understand ? &quot; with a broad gr@@ in@@ sen , he shares his feeling of inclusi@@ veness : &quot;
you have heard !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
&quot; so far , the events of Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling took place in three cities , and the organis@@ ers hope to expand this . all who are inspired by the project can organize t@@ LS in contact to organize their own stor@@ yt@@ elling lines . &quot;
Puerto Rico calls from the United States to re @-@ determination of the sovereig@@ n debt
&quot; with the aim of a re@@ exam of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which took up to 72 million US dollars , participating in the Islamic Cap@@ it@@ ol , the Council of the capital , and ran until the Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the old town of San Ju@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; it was called by the group@@ ing &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ u@@ da@@ dano p@@ or la Audit@@ or@@ Ã­a de la De@@ uda &quot; ( Civil Front for the Neur@@ or@@ am of debts ) and the Ã@@ kom@@ en@@ ical Church of Puerto Ri@@ cos . &quot;
the inter@@ cess@@ ors of the real@@ ign@@ ment of debts have also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos calls for politicians , ti@@ cians and government agencies responsible for debts are responsible for their corruption . &quot;
&quot; we call for a financial examination and a guidel@@ ine committee without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions appropriate re@@ mun@@ eration , which acts in favour of the economy . &quot;
we will be pres@@ pressed and supp@@ ressed .
&quot; the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos refuse to pay a fault , which is not their . &quot;
we will not choose between education and health .
our profitability will not be found with decl@@ ining profitability .
we demand immediate measures .
the island - not into the state @-@ respect integrated territory of the US - is suffering from a heavy financial crisis .
&quot; therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; an governed non @-@ profit non @-@ profit organization without party identity , focusing on the socio @-@ economic development , a law on the government responsibility , as an alternative to existing citizen . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ri@@ cos requires a wide restructuring of state infrastructure .
&quot; exter@@ n@@ ated measures imposed by the outside , without participation and conviction of the citizens are going to be risk to be rejected by the people . &quot;

&quot; the Syrian @-@ Palestinian Web@@ developer Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi , has been missing since more than one year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after having been arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives are continuing the campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions that he has done for an open net . &quot;
&quot; at this year &apos;s re : Pub@@ lica , the annual conference on the digital culture that is organised in Berlin , devoted an event of # Free@@ Bas@@ sel @-@ Camp@@ a@@ ign . &quot;
&quot; MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the Federal Republic for Communication Sciences , and Barbara RÃ¼@@ hl@@ ing , business leaders in Book C@@ ost of Freedom : a Coll@@ ective inquiry ( The costs of Freedom : a collective re@@ research ) . &quot;
&quot; the book that has been published last year and here are license @-@ free , contains a number of attempts which deal with free culture in the face of oppression . &quot;
it is a hom@@ age to Bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction it means :
this book wants to be built like movements of free knowledge and what the real costs are connected to which this is connected .
&quot; acti@@ vi@@ sts , artist , designer , developer , researchers , researchers , researchers , researchers , researchers , researchers , researchers , who have been involved in the movements for free knowledge , have a site working on the fo@@ g , and to create something meaningful from our different experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celeb@@ rities Internet volunteer , who has been det@@ ained since 15 March 2012 in Syria . &quot;
&quot; his name was painted from the directory of the A@@ dra pris@@ oner , in which he sat on 3 October 2015 . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have no information about his current state or residence . &quot;
&quot; the introductory part of his book with the title Coll@@ ective Memory gives his friends and family a voice that will push for his release , and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom . &quot;
&quot; to see how Bas@@ sel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us begin to start thinking about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , acts and decisions . &quot;
why are we today here ?
what have we decided ?
what have we given up extreme convi@@ ctions in this process ?
the Web@@ developer of Open Source and digital activ@@ ist has been in the prison of Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
&quot; in October 2015 Bas@@ sel from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution was transferred to an unknown place . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer , N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; military police bases on the basis of an &quot; &quot; strictly secret &quot; &quot; command of the military arm@@ ament from his cell had taken into A@@ dra . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi reported to be contacted by people on 12 November 2015 , who presented themselves as a insi@@ der @-@ Assad government , and put them in knowledge of an inn@@ ed death against her husband . &quot;
but his residence and condition remains unknown .
&quot; a pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively participating in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel played a crucial role to expand access to the Internet and to knowledge around the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , Tech@@ n@@ ologist and at the moment the leader of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project , the Bas@@ sel , writes on the sides 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
&quot; maybe none of Bas@@ le cultural prototyp@@ es pre@@ fers than the work that he began with a group of arche@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 , to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Palm@@ yr@@ as virtu@@ ell . &quot;
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites of the world , was the elimination of numerous civi@@ liz@@ ations and here wast@@ ed Greek architecture types with hi@@ esi@@ ze traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; Bas@@ soon could not know that ten years after having started working with this work , the IS was all about it , this architecture that is not only em@@ bo@@ died by the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens , but the world . &quot;
&quot; this strip move into the digital archae@@ ology and the conservation has created a zeit@@ geist , which will be in@@ valuable for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , Bas@@ sel could not yet close this project yet . &quot;
&quot; N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison : &quot;
&quot; I have spent my entire life with this , of freedom to dream and bas@@ ins taught me to embrace her . &quot;
I am overwhel@@ med when I n@@ ursed his name .
&quot; Bas@@ sel brought me English , even when he was already in prison . &quot;
I learned to read and speak English well .
&quot; he always has his knowledge with each shared , who has asked . he has taught other inci@@ dents , English to read and speak . &quot;
&quot; Bas@@ sel has opened me the gate to technology . he taught me , both computer and smartphones . &quot;
he brought me the internet .
&quot; he also brought to other instances , as they use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without giving them their hands in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( War@@ ten ) , a pro@@ sab@@ ads , wrote them in the years 2012 till 2015 her husband , when he was in cu@@ sto@@ dy . &quot;
Bas@@ sel and N@@ oura have worked together on the book for a long time .
&quot; they scru@@ b the lyrics to him , when they visited him and he survived them out of the Arabic into English . &quot;
the book is available license @-@ free .

here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It is happening &quot; :

that I reconc@@ iled in the world of your charming eyes
&quot; that I lose the rebel@@ lion in the moment we embrace , &quot;

Bas@@ tion History is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against the regime of Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad , according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( sy@@ ric network for human rights ) disappeared more than 65@@ ,000 people . &quot;
&quot; those who have been arrested or under non @-@ violence by the regime , were tor@@ tured or even executed . &quot;
&quot; until 2016 , according to the international human rights organization Am@@ nest@@ y International at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans died in j@@ ail since 2011 . &quot;
the stories of many other people stay unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bas@@ sel for 2012 .
&quot; today , we repeat our demand in hope that we have to do this for the last time . &quot;
Mozambique : because of corruption de@@ fi@@ red director to release again on forec@@ ast@@ ed post
&quot; as a can@@ cer@@ ated can@@ did with anger on a corruption , he returned to the workplace during the half of his sentence . he returned to the workplace in the state apparatus , where the corruption was committed . &quot;
&quot; this is followed by Di@@ o@@ din@@ o Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced by four other acc@@ used for sus@@ pic@@ u@@ ity of 54 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( about 800 000 Euro ) to 22 years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the money from public funds from the airports of Mozambique , their council Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 board . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was released 2016 because of good leadership and immediately asked for its re@@ setting to the company , which was on April 19th . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with an opinion of the General Public Pro@@ secution of the Republic , which claims the request , there would be no obstacles for Cam@@ ba@@ za again to refer to its old post , since the company was no discipl@@ in@@ ary after his j@@ ail . &quot;
&quot; however , many inhabitants do not have the action well . &quot;
&quot; the centre for public integrity ( Centro de Int@@ egri@@ da@@ de P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica , briefly C@@ IP ) , an local institution dedicated to public transparency , condem@@ ned into an interview with the Deutsche Welle the decision of the company to resume the director : &quot;
&quot; represents a return in the fight against corruption , and constru@@ ed the lack of transparency and is even a step @-@ step with regard to the efforts of our legal system , so the C@@ IP . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what we take note is that the firm should have a discipl@@ ining procedure against the fe@@ ather@@ proof . &quot;
&quot; however , the firm seem to be sh@@ aded , however , does not cause any reasonable legal steps to use the corresponding functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , re@@ jects this behaviour and considers the case as &quot; resistance &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ ba@@ za a competent type would be , he would be advis@@ or after he was sentenced to a sentence and which half has been filled . &quot;
&quot; he could hold numerous lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and his image . &quot;
&quot; but since he is in@@ compet@@ ently , he has entered into the company to be re@@ integrated into the company which he helped to add damage . &quot;
&quot; consequently , it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za will gladly be paid for his silence . &quot;
disgu@@ sting !
&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young , can@@ arian and student of political science in Brazil says , the director had no moral : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za from the state rewards , because he bes@@ ieg@@ ed him I cannot believe that one has already been awarded someone in such a way that has already been so massive . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks the mor@@ ality to serve and serve to the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but it only serves himself on the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state , as hand it has become an in@@ exhaus@@ tible desire and the state itself is tired being loaded and finally sentenced to a long lap@@ se . &quot;
&quot; honest@@ ly , I do not know why this man was rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ te preferred to remember the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remember that a th@@ ief belongs to the prison : &quot;
&quot; th@@ iev@@ es belong to the prison Sam@@ ora Mach@@ ines will not only be remembered as a first independent president in memory , but also as a sharp , one @-@ se@@ der and - next - prop@@ he@@ tic Red@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral represent@@ ations was , when he was energetic that &quot; a ambitious man must be able to all , also the fa@@ ther@@ land for his am@@ bitions , his own individual interest to sell . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if a ambitious person changes my experience that this is not so . he does not change the tactics but he does not address his am@@ bitions . &quot;
a ambitious person is criminal at the same time crimin@@ ally . &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also re@@ pl@@ ain@@ able :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison ; he sat 10 years and came free .
&quot; and today it sets him the company in which he is inde@@ b@@ able , again under the contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ OM@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - Ñ@@ aker _ Raf@@ ik ( @ ac@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) 12th May 2017

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cen@@ sored many users on inj@@ usti@@ ce
the bur@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; means ca@@ ich@@ her@@ ts or sp@@ age .
&quot; photo of San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Commons , Creative Commons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ port@@ ed &quot;
&quot; according to data of Facebook users in Myanmar , the known social network took its po@@ sts from the net , because they enth@@ uses the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people &apos;s indigenous origin or in general as ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; in@@ tox@@ ic &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Facebook cen@@ sored the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or as a part of a initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network .
&quot; over the past few years , the rise of radical nation@@ alistic movements has given the word an extremely valuable con@@ notation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word that is usually used by Ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to fight H@@ ass@@ ay in Myanmar , the company has cen@@ sored a lot of sensu@@ al contents on its platform . &quot;
&quot; it may usually be associated with rac@@ ism , but the word itself is not automatically re@@ generated . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that also Po@@ sts , where they have discussed the use of the word or expressed doubt of his usage . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , there are several bur@@ ial words with fundamental mean@@ ings that have the same letter as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , chair is written in Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &apos; ( sp@@ age ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ ebook@@ us@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at declared the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he had asked his friends on spiritual nature , whether they could w@@ oven , as he could fl@@ ush his back@@ bone as he made a word play . &quot;
&quot; the phr@@ ase ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( la ) to Bur@@ m@@ ese - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
&quot; zin Win is the opinion that she will l@@ essen counter@@ f@@ aler nation@@ alists , however , said that Facebook will be analytical , before it all po@@ sts metals , which dis@@ rup@@ eds in sus@@ pic@@ ion , rac@@ ism . &quot;
Facebook delet@@ es the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it fil@@ tered the word automatically .
automation will not understand what you write on Fac@@ et@@ ook .
&quot; what it should be done instead , the post is carefully to analyse and control it by review the next words . &quot;
for example &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; ( alter@@ nate ) .
&quot; the good is that this dre@@ y nation@@ alists , the h@@ ass@@ language spread , a fairly good lesson . &quot;
now it is time to circum@@ cis@@ ed its nation@@ alism .
&quot; while action may send a strong signal to all , the hate speech likes to keep the efficiency of this strategy not long . &quot;
&quot; the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proved that the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of keywords is often a k@@ atz@@ ing and mouse game , whereby the users social networks will simply start to use a new word or an alternative sp@@ elling of the cen@@ sored word to express their views . &quot;
&quot; the author A@@ ung My@@ at My@@ at describe , such as Facebook began to delete his po@@ sts , when he just wanted to inform his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; from the social network is b@@ anned : &quot;
&quot; when I became aware of this new Directive on Facebook , I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited the Li@@ ken , post and parts of content for 24 hours , because the post @-@ mail &quot; Facebook community standards is not correspon@@ dent . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has a variety of po@@ sts of people away , who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the he@@ ars radi@@ al nation@@ alists . &quot;
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed which has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook
in the post he shared his opinion about why extrem@@ es nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
&quot; Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have more likely to do before the beginning of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ical Internet community to ask for advice : &quot;
&quot; Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma due to their platform , but it does not work . &quot;
such words to cen@@ sored will only bring more hat@@ red within the various communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems that if they started without local context or technical support , and as words as &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; inheritance curr@@ y &quot; . &quot; &quot;
even when they found out that they have made mistakes , they did not try the acci@@ d@@ ently deleted po@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; if only a little more respect for the 15 million benefit , they would have a great turnover , would be great . &quot;
fac@@ ebook @-@ automatic c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship has taken care of much sp@@ oon among users .
&quot; instead of taking it serious , users are now aware of Facebook funny and write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not within the context of salvation , to see whether their po@@ sts are taken from the network . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook po@@ sts , which have no hate speech , but nevertheless it has been removed : &quot;
with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ical text is &quot; I want to sit on a stool and watch pe@@ sen@@ curr@@ y and an Indian film .
&quot; just to try , whether Facebook removed the post , which contains the word of Kal@@ ar . &quot;

&quot; post the post &quot; If you are a doctor , do not heal people ? &quot;

&quot; over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists , have used social networks to extend their voices and their influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate speech in social networks must also join forces in the communities in Myanmar , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced to escape . &quot;
Facebook has been responsible for his failure to critic@@ ise id@@ ols on his bur@@ mes@@ an sites under control .
&quot; but instead of simply the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; to cen@@ sored , it would have been better in context than on code concentrated initiatives and learned from them . &quot;

the nursery is illegal in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; on June 9 , 2017 the Parliament adopted in the country is un@@ anim@@ ously agreed to a law which is to offer this practice so that the pag@@ an age is now at 18 . &quot;
&quot; after this change of spouse , some members &apos; du@@ sting and mus@@ li@@ fel@@ ine religion held at practice , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aja , the leader of inter@@ religious organization ( IR@@ O ) , a group of representatives of the various religious groups of the country gathered that the state does not mix sol@@ v@@ le , since that , age , not the maturity . &quot;
&quot; this happened in case of the fact that Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago is a contract partner of the UN Children &apos;s rights protection , the min@@ ors , every person under the age of 18 . &quot;
&quot; statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children who were married with 15 to 15 percent , in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago , and with 18 were 8,@@ 1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the Statistical Office of the country confirmed that from 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 . &quot;
&quot; online peti@@ tions and social @-@ media movements that stri@@ ves to prevent laws on children , followed on the foot and pleas@@ ing themselves great support . undoubtedly hal@@ ting them to bring this result . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , not everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hind@@ u leader Z. B. had no concerns about the critics of children &apos;s e to say , they ought to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this sort of religious opposition set for tensions in this actually un@@ complicated matter , and some@@ time they came upon whether the opposition would undermine the opposition at all . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of 2017 the law was decided against the children , despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of opposition and an independent , which he un@@ veil@@ ed - so that he could be discussed in Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him to the law . &quot;
now only the President of the country must agree with the law .
one of the transm@@ itters of the country gave on Facebook a Status update to which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ agram has posted once again :
&quot; Mr Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the law@@ n@@ ave against the children &apos;s house was decided in the representative case with 35 votes for this , and no one against it . &quot;
&quot; having previously agreed at the Senate , the draft can now be made to the law . &quot;
the majority of the social @-@ media user was thrilled because the laws were finally changed to children .
&quot; Facebook @-@ Member Lov@@ ell Francis , which is a mini@@ stries in the Ministry of Agriculture , said : &quot;
&quot; it has too much time and un@@ necessary bar@@ racks , but know your thing ? the children &apos;s heart is illegal in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago now illegal , and this is almost every prize . &quot;
&quot; while A@@ bel Jackson &apos;s opinion , it was definitely long enough to create the practice , Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas exce@@ ed@@ ingly happy that the day was finally come : &quot;
&quot; public status update on Facebook by Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which bes@@ otes : , , Her@@ vor@@ rag@@ ing News ! &quot;
the spouse has been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for it - 0 ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ota Mut@@ ota who belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil society group , which said quite openly about how important the adoption of the law be said : &quot;
the hei@@ g@@ ous age in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious gathering 18 years .
&quot; the draft for amend@@ ment of the spouse have been announced today , on 9 June 2017 . &quot;
in the House of Represent@@ atives there are 41 members and of them were present at 35 during the vote .
&quot; all members who were against , have voted for the law . &quot;
the bab@@ e is in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago by law no longer allowed .
it was a long struggle ( ... ) # child@@ r@@ ro@@ dents .
many thanks to all acti@@ vi@@ sts who bought him .
congratulations .

&quot; but a possible hook comes in the shape of satellite Mahar@@ aja therefore , the Secretary @-@ General of San@@ at@@ an Dhar@@ ma Ma@@ ha Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hind@@ u organization of the country . &quot;
&quot; months ago Mahar@@ aja announced his intention to undertake judicial steps , the law should be adopted , and he seems to rede@@ em his promises now . &quot;
&quot; during the General State University Paris Al ra@@ wi , a dis@@ astro@@ us of the law , said , it was certainly true , if Mahar@@ aja are going forward against the law , the most social media users , you would have the debate about the subject differently . &quot;
Patricia Vor@@ rell proposed :
&quot; dear Sat , if we think instead of keep the discussion so generally speaking , in a way that the state , our daughters , that they may not be caused by large , stub@@ born males who are needed to give them their own , dis@@ mis@@ ed , then you would then be ready to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you believe it is not a problem ?
&quot; but whether there is now an important step against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places around the world where children are legal in different grad@@ ations , or continue to be the norm , although there are laws that they tell . &quot;

&quot; through the mir@@ rors of web pages , Turkish users can look at Wikipedia @-@ contents . &quot;
&quot; the English @-@ language Wikipedia @-@ site was represented on 18 January 2012 , oppos@@ ing the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright laws in the USA , internationally completed . &quot;
created by Wikipedia ( CC BY @-@ SA 3.0 )
&quot; since more than one month , Turkey lock@@ out the popular and on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cy@@ clo@@ pedia . &quot;
day by day is more evident how important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information .
both students and re@@ por@@ ters and fans of TV series are opposed to the block@@ age .
&quot; although many techniques used internet users are used to use or@@ bit@@ ing tools for blo@@ ated web pages ( a current article from the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third @-@ largest VPN pre@@ val@@ ence of the world ) , most of the ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been released article by Wikipedia , as recently published in a published report by Berk@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University has been taking place after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) . &quot;
&quot; after China , Turkey is the most known country in the world when it comes to massive c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship at Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform continues to be locked , there are several mir@@ r@@ or@@ sides ( pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and often be updated ) . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary Peer @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ) , when the platform supports all Turkish Wikipedia @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( so machine calculator ) , which does not base itself on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship difficult . &quot;
the content is available despite legal prohibition but abru@@ ptly .
in a B@@ log@@ post IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
&quot; after we have heard the news ( about the blo@@ cking of Wikipedia ) , we put everything about this , sn@@ ap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the ability to read the contents on de@@ centralized and distributed way . &quot;
&quot; this can help users to get at least all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wikipedia.org itself . &quot;
&quot; IP@@ FS was also carried out that this step was carried out independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is only about screen@@ shots and no dynamic or dynamic versions of the website . &quot;
&quot; however , Vi@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to handle the sperm . &quot;
&quot; Cr@@ isti@@ an Con@@ sun@@ i by Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has found both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ atri@@ .org , a Mir@@ r@@ or@@ b of Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open @-@ source project that everyone can use to be locked to similar mir@@ r@@ or@@ pages when in the respective country Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ sunny , Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices member as well as staff at Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast : &quot;
it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy address to a mirror .
&quot; you access@@ es to another URL that is not the original . that what one can then see is from Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; in essence , the server leads the request to the right Wikipedia @-@ page so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself if these are locked in Turkey . &quot;
this is executed by a server that is not in Turkey .

&quot; Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos that he looked around , never satisfied . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with poor@@ ly positioned moti@@ fs and exten@@ dable colors . &quot;
the motiv@@ ates him to wear yourself a camera with yourself and try to radi@@ ate the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar , endeav@@ ours to bring to the international scene at the age of 28 . &quot;
&quot; and his homeland directly next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offering it the perfect opportunity to shoot the photos that draw attention to Nep@@ al@@ ese animals . &quot;
he described on Facebook as he helps him first @-@ class situation at his work :
&quot; I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could there be better for a passionate game figure ! ! &quot;
&quot; I looked at home , when suddenly Nav@@ ar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan Gai@@ da Lodge ) announced . he had a call from my Father , that on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river was a le@@ op@@ ard . &quot;
the river dam@@ m is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I burned with my camera and was in a few minutes there .
&quot; my father had observed him and showed me the place on the other river , where the Leopard was , and I immediately began to kne@@ es pictures ! ! &quot;
&quot; Sag@@ ar aims to achieve cooperation with authorities to gain global recognition for Nep@@ al@@ ese nature and would like to deep@@ en our understanding that wild animals are not so fright@@ ening , as they look like . &quot;
&quot; and he should know it , because he already stood tig@@ ers from face to face toward : &quot;
a tiger can not be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
&quot; also I had appeared because of darkness on the way home , when suddenly the king of the Bu@@ ckl@@ ks appeared . he immediately sets us , we see ourselves and he sat down through the S@@ al @-@ trees ! ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I cli@@ pping for environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot;
&quot; however , his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ al@@ ese nature and wildlife is not always easy . &quot;
&quot; he wa@@ ited for 22 days and lived mostly in a tent , in order to make at the Bar@@ dia National Park recordings of Ot@@ tern . up to 12 days lasted until he was able to photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodation . &quot;

&quot; this entry was written by Kay@@ on@@ aa@@ z K@@ aly@@ anwal@@ de , and originally published on Video Volunte@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international Community media organization from India . &quot;
a revised version was published here as part of a Content Sharing Convention .
&quot; in many parts of India , women do avoid women with the greatest care to address the name of her husband or even of older men in the family . &quot;
instead they use a pron@@ oun or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pr@@ ad@@ esh give women to respect that they should respect the husband &apos;s social pressure , as well as fear of the consequences they should ab@@ ide the norm to exercise this practice . &quot;
&quot; last year Mal@@ ati Ma@@ hat@@ oto was condem@@ ned out of the Indian State of O@@ dish@@ a , and rejected by her family and the village of the village after they had addressed a married couple with names . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of its wives also do not call on behalf of the names , is also among men . however , they have much less justi@@ fication if at all , they should not come up with this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , occurred nine wives , among them Health Care as well as house@@ wives , a unique club with and became quick to the main theme of the city . &quot;
it is a place only for them alone where they can discuss and discuss the enemies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
&quot; as one of 56 clubs which exist in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Ba@@ dal , which is operated by the community of Video Volunte@@ ers , and is committed to dismant@@ ling the patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ hin@@ i Pa@@ was worked for seven years with the help of her video camera on the re@@ discovery of practices , such as children @-@ up to the ban@@ ishment of H@@ IV@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and guides these clubs . &quot;
they told them how these clubs are created a safe place for these women and they simultaneously have made them to botanical inside of change .
&quot; the first video , the Ro@@ hin@@ i appeared in its discussion round , tr@@ aded by women who do not name her husband in the name . &quot;
she decided to decide on this subject because she wanted to open the interview about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem which women can easily identify .
&quot; in addition , the name of her husband is not to speak out loud , is a burning , who kept them all paid and never ques@@ tioned . &quot;
Ro@@ hin@@ i means :
this tradition testi@@ fied that a woman is respected her husband and wishes him a long life .
&quot; a woman who doesn &apos;t hold it , is regarded as being depos@@ ited as a woman without mor@@ als . &quot;
the tradition is so deeply ro@@ oted that we have never thought up to this discussion .
&quot; at the beginning he wanted to go Ro@@ hin@@ i , which has never called her husband so far in his name at home as it is running . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Ro@@ hin@@ i tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband weigh even long before the video was at the end .
&quot; practi@@ tioners , my husband , turned to me and said , I sol@@ le him from now on in his name . &quot;
with this self @-@ confidence in the baggage it started ro@@ hin@@ i its first discussion club .
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; &quot; never before . some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women . &quot;
at the beginning of the round Ro@@ hin@@ i showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pr@@ ad@@ esh .
&quot; after the video projection , the women who tried to bring discussion with a exercise in motion . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ hin@@ i asked every participant , to say the name of her husband with various feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she asked all , &quot; &quot; If we cannot say the name of our husband , but they can call us as they want , means that they do not respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when she brought the name of her husband over the lips , says Ro@@ hin@@ i Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on the Bre@@ aks of a centuries @-@ based tradition , in the married women should never speak the name of her husband . &quot;
Ro@@ hin@@ i tells :
a woman was so shy that she turned out during the whole exercise ; another decided to release the whole changed fru@@ stration against him and his family by lowering him .
the expression on her faces was ek@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; yet in the adren@@ alin rush along with an old bre@@ eze , the women decided that they would actually try home to name her husband in the name . &quot;
and they kept their word .
in the next few days Ro@@ hin@@ i received a variety of reports .
the husband called a woman called Ro@@ hin@@ i and asked what ideas she put the women in the head : his wife could not stop his name .
another club member decided to do it with dinner before the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she died , she got afraid and said that there was a mistake . &quot;
&quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; Ro@@ hin@@ i said , I was doing it . &quot;
a husband of a participant was less compreh@@ en@@ sible and the situation arose in violence .
&quot; Ro@@ hin@@ i reports how women tried to stop other practices , such as the wearing of the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red point on the forehead , which indicates the spouse . &quot;
why have only women show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would carry the zin@@ ess red spot when he did . &quot;
he laugh@@ ed only and I heard it to carry him .
&quot; the other women did not complete thereby , but my , they are now in a better position , even to choose him in some days . &quot;
for many women the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we do a trip with each discussion club . &quot;
we usually pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; I do not want the women make sure who could hear what could hear , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in her life they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cake ; they d@@ anced , and spoke about things that they never had thought before . &quot;
Ro@@ hin@@ i says :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have been working on some things , for example how our identi@@ ties have been @-@ knot@@ ted to our husband , never as honest . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to say certain things loud , regardless of how small they occur . &quot;
in a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing .
some women have lived in the group since their marriage only Sar@@ is .
&quot; for most is the okay , but some wanted to bear a sal@@ v@@ ein @-@ c@@ ta , a broad Hem@@ d about a p@@ ants ; they did not have been dr@@ unk . &quot;
&quot; after a lot of dispute and discussion about the advantages of own clos@@ ets , mor@@ als associated with the Sar@@ is and much more , ding@@ y Ro@@ hin@@ i its own pair of Kur@@ t@@ as ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) into a discussion round , so that the women could carry them . &quot;
&quot; next , they now decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear Je@@ ans and Ro@@ hin@@ i is sure that they will be able to create it . &quot;
&quot; on the question , whether in the five months of their first discussion club has already changed something , Ro@@ hin@@ i confirms that things slowly come into roles : &quot;
we have just made small steps so far .
&quot; some women tried it a few times , but then list@@ ened to say the name of her husband . &quot;
&quot; some , included me , make it still , but only if they are alone and no other family members are there . &quot;
only one or two will continue to tell the name of her husband ; only one or two women now wearing Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their forehead .
&quot; the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives , like the fin@@ ch to achieve more freedom of movement or the own clos@@ ets - at the end of a hard to navig@@ ating river . &quot;
&quot; by giving each other confidence , they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
how Ro@@ hin@@ i explains :
each of us is a victim of patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am too .
but this pru@@ dent gives each of us the confidence that will change something .
&quot; and I know that it is not just limited to 30 families . it will give a chain re@@ traction , when each woman will go home and other people told them what we talk and what we do . &quot;
we are all sitting in the same boat .

&quot; at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi . &quot;
one of the victims has been enth@@ using and part of the organs have been taken .
&quot; two men were arrested and realized in the result , they were that the organs of Sham@@ anas in Tanzania and Malawi . &quot;

&quot; another group , the aim of nar@@ rati@@ ation for ob@@ sc@@ ure is , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; this led to this , that the UN 2016 conducted a mission in the South African country to investigate these practices . &quot;
&quot; the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of the southern Africa , particularly in the neighbouring country Tanzania , where the government campaigns to fight these su@@ pers@@ ti@@ tions and pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot;

PR@@ M believes that the sh@@ aman is involved in the death of the glorious men .
&quot; the persecution and ass@@ ass@@ ination of smooth individuals for the extraction and selling of their organs in the district of Mor@@ ru@@ mb@@ ala , for pres@@ su@@ pers@@ ti@@ tious ritu@@ als , has been consult@@ ed the police of the Republic of Mozambique ( PR@@ M ) , which also indicates the police of the Republic of Mozambique ( PR@@ M ) , which had been given to the police of the Republic of Mozambique , according to the victims in the head . &quot;

a photo by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia probably appeared just recently .
this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partner agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
&quot; the case of the det@@ ained Chinese disco Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o had given attention in the international community , after his lawyer had been announced at the end of June that he has been delivered to hospital for liver cancer in the repository . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Li@@ u has been sentenced to eleven years of prison for &quot; &quot; Subversion &quot; &quot; ( displ@@ ac@@ ement ) after being involved in the draft of the Charter , a manifest@@ o which had committed the democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the No@@ bel Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the State Department in China has referred to Li@@ us as &quot; &quot; an internal matter &quot; &quot; and a spokes@@ man told , he did not consider it as &quot; &quot; not required to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot;
&quot; yet China continues to receive views from the international community , the No@@ bel lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , po@@ et Li@@ u X@@ ia , to allow him to permit a treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are fully exploited . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ized some reactions from abroad .
united Nations
&quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hus@@ sein , the Com@@ miss@@ ary of the United Nations for Human Rights , met at the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the case of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; however , a speaker was to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to facilitate li@@ u abroad . &quot;
Denmark
Norway &apos;s mini@@ stries Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Br@@ ing have initi@@ ates questions about Li@@ us release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway took up into Sto@@ cks , after the No@@ bel Prize 2010 was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government won &apos;t have to do anything with the decision . &quot;
&quot; diplomatic relations were first continued in December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to resume the sal@@ mon imports after China , since the exports have been mostly blocked since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; having spread the message that Li@@ u had seriously fallen , the No@@ bel &apos;s Committee brought his hope for an unconditional release of the expression and lu@@ d Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to his hearing , he was not able to stop his prize . &quot;
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
&quot; on July 6 , the European Parliament adopted a decision on which China was prom@@ pted to free Li@@ u and his wife immediately from the ar@@ rest @-@ rest and to allow him to seek medical support , where he wants . &quot;
&quot; the peak of the EU , Federica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , called for China also for the release Li@@ us on how they finish in an explanation on 30 June : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we are waiting at the same time that China lifts all restrictions by Mr. Li@@ us wife as well as family members . &quot;
&quot; you should meet all visits and receive , who wish them , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot;
United States of America
&quot; Ambassador of Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad shared with that the Americans &apos; wish him that he has the possibility for treatment abroad , in this respect it may help him in his recovery . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person from the U.S. Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , gave the news agency AF@@ P on 27th June that the message to allow the Chinese authorities to release not only Li@@ u , but also to liber@@ ate his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from their home@@ ar@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; the request of the US message attracted a fur@@ ious response from China to himself , with the statements of the Ministry of Foreign Minister , that &quot; no country have the right to make a single and ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared with that China should offer the Couple the following :
&quot; protection and freedom such as free access and access to medical care of his choice , to which they have to claim according to Chinese constitution and legal systems as well as international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the US Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz have also adopted a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to push Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condi@@ tionally . &quot;
&quot; I urge China to allow the No@@ bel lau@@ re@@ ates # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condi@@ tionally , so he can move into a proper medical treatment . http : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o &quot;
Denmark
&quot; the German Government Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on 3 July , Berlin I hope that Li@@ u &quot; receives all the medical support that he needs &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
the Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
previously reported diplomatic sources in Beijing of the news agency Re@@ u@@ ters that China had great concerns about whether the vor@@ tex of Li@@ u could over@@ look the visit to Hamburg .
Canada
&quot; on 28 June , the Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um to provide an appropriate medical care to provide and give him the opportunity to take care of his family . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ us attorney told AF@@ P previously , that Li@@ us Ms. W@@ u X@@ ia could visit him every day , but the police are always in hospital , and that it is Li@@ u not allowed to talk to someone outside , including his lawyers . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells about :
&quot; Canada calls China to maintain its international human rights oblig@@ atory , including freedom of expression , true and responsible for the exercise of these rights . &quot;
France
&quot; France &apos;s Foreign State Department to release China in an Declaration on 29 June , Li@@ u made of humanitarian grounds : &quot;
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to make sure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o will receive all the treatments that he , irrespective of where , requires . furthermore , his wife and his family can have contact with him . &quot;
&quot; although the news sen@@ ders France Info already reported that the French government Li@@ u would welcome in the country , gave the Foreign Department that there will be no further information whether France will eventually take him . &quot;
Taiwan
&quot; in Taiwan , the Council of the forti@@ fications in Taiwan called on 27 June to release Li@@ u and to show a greater tolerance to those who use peaceful means to challenge political reforms and democratic development . &quot;
&quot; the tai@@ w@@ anese leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ors Yu Me@@ i @-@ n@@ u from the rules of the New Pro@@ gress Party , China also called to allow the cran@@ ial intellectual Li@@ u to treat yourself in Taiwan . &quot;
Dalai Lama
&quot; the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama was very concerned with a statement on 28 June around Li@@ u and gave him to pray for Li@@ us wellness . &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my belief that the initiatives which he took and for which he was strict , to a harmon@@ ious , stable and aff@@ lu@@ ent China would have contributed to a peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I felt personally very moved and also encouraged , when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the charter 08 signed , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question might seem stup@@ id since Singapore is recognized as an independent state in Singapore .
&quot; but according to the Minister of Minister K. Shan@@ gr@@ gam , Singapore should be considered as a city . &quot;
this re@@ mark has triggered a debate in the blog@@ osph@@ ere .
&quot; during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of New York , the Minister , that many people critic@@ ise the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they are opposed to Singapore with other countries . &quot;
he support that Singapore should be considered as a city .
... nobody asked to question whether New York is a democracy ...
this is where most people go a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a land .
&quot; the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io def@@ ences the Minister of Justice , &quot; &quot; the logic to rot@@ ate the existing author@@ it@@ arian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot;
&quot; and then , after all our efforts and sacrific@@ es , this valuable land , we hear that we eventually be no country . &quot;
&quot; it sound@@ ed as vul@@ gar , it had the name of a flight before the responsibilities , a must . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , eat land then it is then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons used by Shan@@ gr@@ gam were not very pos@@ h : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of what he appeared inev@@ it@@ ably und@@ em@@ ocratic . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently managed by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; once you reach the core point of the topic , again the good old corp@@ ses from the author@@ it@@ arian fe@@ eders which give up Democrats , leaving the twi@@ sted logic since it fits better to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the end , the answers were given in the last week of Shan@@ gr@@ gam , answers to his American guests in regard to our press , our J@@ udi@@ k@@ ative , our political system really non @-@ answer . &quot;
corresponding questions tar@@ ned with non @-@ answers rational kind .
&quot; Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Shan@@ mu@@ gam , in his opinion , since they did not understand this conclusion . &quot;
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , but a city is , so in which country belongs to our city ... &quot;
&quot; short , I understand nothing . &quot;
&quot; I would be very grateful if our wer@@ ter K Shan@@ gr@@ gam , who would take their efforts to clear this point unless he was paid high , in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore . &quot;
&quot; on the blog his comment , he pointed out to the reviews that one should begin to read the entire co @-@ ordin@@ ance of the conference so that you could get better understand the context of the statements of Shan@@ gr@@ gam , according to which Singapore is a city and no land . &quot;
read the ordin@@ ance .
&quot; he said that Singapore is rather a &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; as a country , &quot; &quot; declared why the elections in Singapore was so un@@ easier , even if we are looking forward to free and fair elections . &quot;
he went to Singapore with cities in the United States ( and how many of these cities saw a party in decades ? ) .
&quot; he said , Singapore &quot; was not a country , &quot; he obviously did not make sense in this sense ! &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Shan@@ mu@@ gam that makes a leader of a her@@ etic generation to make such pol@@ em@@ ical statement .
&quot; I am talking about what the judicial Minister of Singapore has said , very ver@@ able ... &quot;
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de what I expect - be with them or not , but this is another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Shan@@ mu@@ gam , a member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure whether he really believes that he is defended correctly and aware of what he defended . &quot;
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review submitted the sh@@ aking points of Shan@@ bra@@ g@@ ams arguments :
does Mr. Shan@@ mu@@ gam &quot; gut@@ ters a mistake to commit or was it a Freu@@ d@@ scher De@@ achers ?
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we will be viewed as independent and sovereig@@ n state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , in which country go the sovereig@@ n rights of the city of Singapore ? &quot;
&quot; Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city . &quot;
&quot; since he plays an important role within the state of government , the statements of Mr Shan@@ gr@@ gam is of serious significance . &quot;
&quot; why do the Lon@@ av@@ ail of its military service , defend it only their city but not their land ? &quot;
who must pay our Prime Minister invo@@ ices ?
what is the value of our pink recruitment ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade to the affirm@@ ation , Singapore is and always was a city : &quot;
&quot; I have not said , what I said ... &quot;
this set seems to have become many av@@ av@@ ant ...
no one has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we were always a city / island nation .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; the defense of the country especially &quot; &quot; etc . &quot; &quot; but that is not quite true . &quot;
we should be talking more of the defense of the city .

global Vo@@ ices asked before Sh@@ em his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect about your place of residence or home country ?
&quot; your answers will be published here as part of an ongoing series , with the ru@@ mo@@ urs about certain parts of the world , and another fac@@ et will be shown . &quot;
&quot; the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editorial board for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
&quot; the question , which is provided to me in Japan is &quot; &quot; are you American ? &quot;
&quot; no , I am sorry , &quot; answered me . &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live and back in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on which situation the conversation takes place , it is regarded as polite , interest in his inter@@ loc@@ ut@@ or , by asking personal questions . &quot;
&quot; on my clari@@ fications , then the default answer is usually follows : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , Ice hockey , Nature . &quot; many cann@@ on cook may be held internally , if they are held to Americans , but me do not distur@@ b . &quot;
&quot; for someone who don &apos;t know , there is little that distingu@@ ishes us edge of Americ@@ an@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans will find a Can@@ adi@@ c F@@ ahn@@ e well visible in their back@@ pack , when they travel . &quot;
all love car@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans on the other hand ... .
&quot; it was also known as I began 20 years ago , through the world - before Donald Tru@@ mp , in front of the One in Iraq and before 11 September . &quot;
Kan@@ adi@@ er have always worn small map@@ le blades at their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care !
with us there are no weapons !
gender @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
&quot; all seem to think , Canada is so great . &quot;
we are polite .
&quot; we obviously say very often &quot; sorry . &quot; &quot;
Canada is regarded as the toler@@ ant country toward ethnic groups .
we are not like these types south of the border .
we Kan@@ adi@@ er are nice .
I hate this .
&quot; first , I have many American friends that I admire very . &quot;
it would make me nothing if you would change for example with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
&quot; but there are also some problems with the stamps &quot; &quot; nice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; firstly : as &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; means to be in essence , sp@@ ie@@ ful , gentle , but trag@@ ic , un@@ important figure NE@@ D Fl@@ anders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( which has one &apos;s own Canadian doubles ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada really would be a nation full of people like NE@@ D Fl@@ anders would be indeed a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there is no corners and edges , nothing where you can encounter . &quot;
harm@@ less to be incon@@ spic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and not to earn any attention .
&quot; this can be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , distant from the things that happen around one around . &quot;
&quot; I would even go to say that the desire to be free and alone , a captain of the Can@@ adi@@ er . &quot;
we are circum@@ cis@@ ed to deal with our own affairs only .
&quot; what out@@ standing than &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans are not often talking about the fence and the neighbors .
&quot; we lack the warm , open kindness that I now connect with my American friends . &quot;
&quot; luck@@ ily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) , then Jus@@ tin Tru@@ de@@ au then entered the stage to show that Kan@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our Prime Minister has Canada just made sexy . &quot;
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ odi@@ zed Thailand &apos;s jun@@ ta
&quot; one in Thailand &apos;s famous pop @-@ band released a music video called the Jun@@ ta par@@ odi@@ zed , which will re@@ produce power and reg@@ ain in spite of its promises , continues to re@@ igns the country . &quot;
&quot; the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells them his girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; although not expressly politically , the music video refers to the continued military rule of the jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was pra@@ ised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video of the song was a giant success .
&quot; only within the first three days , that was shared on Facebook @-@ loaded Video 1.@@ 254 times and received 8.@@ 800 Li@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; last month , the Charlie @-@ Chap@@ lin @-@ Video &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand , after a group of acti@@ vi@@ sts asked the public to watch this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to the Thai policy , in particular how it beha@@ ves with the situation of the country under the jun@@ ta rule . &quot;
&quot; take a look at these recordings of the video , which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has been pursued in the past three years . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; could possibly refer to the dr@@ ak@@ onic section 44 of the provisional Constitution , which makes the upper limits of the He@@ eres , absolute decision @-@ making authority over important national issues . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : change your attitude &quot; refers to the &quot; &quot; modification &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , acti@@ vi@@ sts , politicians and other people who are considered by the jun@@ ta as critics . &quot;
&quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crimin@@ ality , whose v@@ ague and un@@ clear rules are often exploited by the authorities to conce@@ aled acti@@ vi@@ sts and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose also a new unit in the army has also been established , the online content is monitored and persons involved , the mon@@ archy will be prosec@@ uted and prosec@@ uted . &quot;
Thailand uses a stri@@ pping song against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( majest@@ y ) .
on 20 May 2014 in Thailand the war was right .
two days later it came to a cou@@ p of the army .
&quot; one of the problems that the jun@@ ta continues to be prosec@@ uted , its decision is to buy expensive U boats , although security experts have war@@ ned that the purchase is un@@ necessary and a waste of control . &quot;
&quot; in the video will even be shown how people will be thrown into a black delivery weight before one gets into an inter@@ ni@@ fication , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are sitting in j@@ ail , because they are sup@@ pose@@ dly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and they are used for long @-@ pressure pen@@ alties , they should be pen@@ ins@@ ing the mon@@ archy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile the te@@ aser of the song members of the band performed the Sal@@ ute of &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em &quot; im@@ i@@ ded , that was already used by put@@ sch @-@ opponents during the protests in 2014 . &quot;
life continues on the ruins of the spirit @-@ cities in eastern Asia @-@ Asia

&quot; the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with friendly permission . &quot;
the post@@ war society reco@@ vers only very slowly into East @-@ southeast @-@ Asia primarily in the T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al district .
&quot; it has been over 20 years since the Georgian @-@ ab@@ ch@@ astic war was officially ended , but his sc@@ ars are still strongly visible in this part of the republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the Northern District in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show distinctive images .
&quot; villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ hta , Poly@@ ana and Khar@@ chil@@ ava are located in the Carbon basin of Ab@@ ch@@ asi@@ es . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , shut@@ down , Geor@@ gi@@ ers and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
&quot; today , the largest part of Russians and evenings are living in the area . &quot;
such settlements are called in Ab@@ ch@@ asi@@ es as well as Gei@@ ster@@ cities .
&quot; in the post @-@ war period we lived here even more than 10,000 people , today there are only a few hundred people in these des@@ ks cities . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the District is 16@@ ,000 people , after it has hardly risen over a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 , about 43@@ ,000 people lived in this district . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; all of this is a consequence of the war &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the empty five @-@ story residential blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960 &apos;s , which are called Chr@@ mat@@ ch@@ uk@@ ov@@ ka , symbo@@ lic@@ ally represent the decline and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are dropped and quite rare they are inhabited of more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native young man .
&quot; he begins a conversation , and it is hard to stop this . &quot;
&quot; that is all a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot;
it is nevertheless clear . &quot;
in front of the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens , which are all of the community . &quot;
&quot; now , there is only paved road with f@@ aded glory buildings . &quot;
&quot; the people , who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning of the Soviet Union , have left the district . &quot;
in the Spirit of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha there live approximately fifty residents .
&quot; approximately 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages , it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; the Chr@@ mat@@ ch@@ ov@@ kas , which can accommodate one or two families , one can recognize in the balconies where laundry is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; as they discover me with the camera in the hand , they get immediately going back . &quot;
&quot; our mother is forbidden to let us photograph , &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; it simply has forbidden to us it is all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ per@@ ed her girlfriend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
&quot; families are also involved in the sub @-@ business economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for the own needs ) such as Vi@@ eh@@ aring , be@@ ek@@ e@@ eping and vegetable cultivation . &quot;
it is difficult to get over the l@@ aps .
the District administration supplies in the winter free candles and bread for the villages .

&quot; about ten years ago , an older woman moved with the name Gal@@ ina ( or a@@ unt G@@ alya as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to D@@ sch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha . &quot;
&quot; despite their oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left before Ab@@ ch@@ asi@@ es to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in ch@@ rom@@ asi@@ es , &quot; she tells her . &quot;
Gal@@ ina wants to accept no financial aid from her daughter and assi@@ onate with her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly R@@ ente are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; we have no fear of dark street or a few people . &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; in fact , it is more likely to do with lo@@ oting . &quot;
after the war there was hardly any work and everyone lived like it was right .
I remember how the city and war were once .
&quot; as our conversation face the end , there is a little boy over us . &quot;
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hidden .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy hun@@ ted him back .
&quot; he plays with the ball , which then down the hill . &quot;
a group of children now trac@@ ted to the ball .
&quot; while they run , some of them have stones on the falling buildings . &quot;
these ruins are a part of their childhood who ensure the im@@ itation in their lives .
they do not know it differently .

Mexico houses &quot; Mama Africa &quot; migrants on their long journey

&quot; this article of Amy Br@@ acken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and published here with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; across the road of migrants , Europe or Latin America , certain places for their hospitality are known . &quot;
&quot; I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he is located on the border with Guatemala . &quot;
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is headed by a 59@@ - J@@ ol@@ gen Mex@@ ic@@ an@@ erin , a small woman with a cor@@ als @-@ pink no@@ wa@@ ist and gold @-@ colored Ear@@ r@@ ingen in T@@ ed@@ dy@@ bears form . &quot;
she is called Conc@@ ep@@ ciÃ³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless they know many under the name Mama Africa .
&quot; this nickname is the fact trained that the hotel ( or rather they themselves ) has become a target for Afri@@ kan@@ er and Hai@@ tian , who are on the passage . &quot;
the hotel has rather no charm .
&quot; for about 2,50 dollars the night sleeping the guests in simple rooms , with cold , shiel@@ ded walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the event there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a c@@ age .
there is no sign@@ post to the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Haiti &apos;s immigrants come here .
&quot; sometimes , Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells the people in full small buses and from the upper part of the coast to call it : &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
&quot; where are you Mama Africa ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez has received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept outside on cardboard . &quot;
it does not want to reject anyone .
&quot; she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , they bought them drugs that they cannot pay them , they mass@@ aged them with a bal@@ m that exhaus@@ tive from the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , is recently arrived . &quot;
I asked him if M@@ um Africa was a appropriate nickname for Mrs Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a jo@@ gh@@ ur@@ che ) posi@@ ert with Conc@@ ep@@ ciÃ³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Br@@ acken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; answered with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it fits to her , as African women are very nice women . &quot;
very loving .
she has the cordi@@ ality of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister who return to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
&quot; you have lived in Brazil , however , it is for some Afri@@ kan@@ ers who are on the way to the United States to make normal a first stop in South America and then move towards north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard from other companion of Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he tells that the Hai@@ tian and Afri@@ kan@@ ers often go along the track and that Afri@@ kan@@ ers are already speaking on W@@ hat@@ s@@ App from Ms Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
how many of his way@@ head has lived Michel@@ et previously in Brazil and has worked as a construction workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the football championship .
&quot; when the Brazilian economy was we@@ aker , he began his journey to the United States . &quot;
he has been a guest at Mama Africa : he s@@ ells SI@@ M cards to save the necessary money to buy the B@@ usti@@ cket after Ti@@ juana .
I ask him whether he will have contact with Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let them go again , &quot; &quot; he smiling . &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells her guests a lot of text messages if they went away to gr@@ ate them or to tell her about the course of their journey .
they explained that their Christian faith of the drive of their work is .
&quot; she does not know much about Africa but their guests have brought her , chicken as in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is perhaps well known here , but it is not the only funk hope for migrants who travel by tap@@ est@@ ula . &quot;
at the other end of the city a dead @-@ end leads to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
these winter have added to Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family in her small house .
&quot; he is polic@@ eman , and has established that the B@@ usti@@ ckets will be sold to numerous African immigrants . &quot;
&quot; he began to help them to get a reasonable price , then he has offered them his house for one dollar the night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment there are 25 people there , mainly Hai@@ tian . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on blan@@ kets on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a kitchenette outside . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are doing .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he tells . &quot; I have experienced what they experience . &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people can help and others do not help . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support .
&quot; after having lived for three years , he was moved to a raid on his work place from the United States . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants who travels through Tap@@ ach@@ ula , comes from Central America , other inhabitants also open the doors of their houses for them . &quot;
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ Ã©@@ n@@ dez tells me that he was cap@@ tiv@@ ated in Honduras with his wife and three children from people who wanted to die with him without having a plan .
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he was asked for an accommodation and well @-@ known , a single @-@ stone , has offered it her roof . &quot;
&quot; a few months later the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go . &quot;
back to the house of Mama Africa is all back full of guests .
in the course you consult the travellers quiet their tele@@ phones .
&quot; a mini@@ bus arrived today and has got 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but it is also nostal@@ g@@ ically because of which I went away . &quot;
like a st@@ um@@ my grand@@ mother bl@@ asting her in her album with numerous photos .
&quot; there is one of her daughter with African hair lac@@ ed that you have made a customer , some photos of their grand@@ children and many travellers more , boy and old . &quot;
they are sad , while she presents me briefly . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ a se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; repeat them every time . &quot; &quot; they have already been going . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang &apos;s inhabitants are forced to install on their mobile phones to install a surveillance app .
an check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang from Twitter @-@ users &apos; % &apos; escape %
&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minorities region in the West China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; on July 10 , the mobile phones at the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an District of the city of Uru@@ m@@ qi is a cell notification in which she points the District government , a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; web cleans@@ ing &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the message is said that the app will get access to terrorist information access . &quot;
&quot; however , the authorities to use the App also to use the App for more than the fight against terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia were arrested 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women in the autonomous I@@ li Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ fecture , because they , shortly after they had installed the app , messages with a private We@@ ar group . &quot;
&quot; in the communication of the police , the app will determine the sources and distribution paths of terrorists , together with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang@@ s web page describes the App as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection of protection with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ ang@@ u Telec@@ om . &quot;
&quot; the main function is the block@@ ing porno@@ graphic websites , of online fraud , Tro@@ jan@@ ern and ph@@ ishing pages to make users attentive how much time they spend online , and to control the own home network . &quot;
this app with the filters for min@@ ors should help children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
&quot; for example , the &quot; &quot; remote &quot; &quot; state actors or even h@@ acker can manipul@@ ate the home network of a person to manipul@@ ate or ste@@ al from it . &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
&quot; while announcements over digital c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in China are mostly concentr@@ ating on the experience of users in the bigger cities in the east and south , the reality is very often d@@ Ã¼@@ ster@@ er for those who live in remote , alleg@@ ed ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; to limit the rest and dis@@ satisfaction in the conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme quot@@ ations and monitoring measures as well as rout@@ in@@ em@@ usi@@ oned Internet sites . &quot;
&quot; this published on Twitter @-@ based media out@@ let &quot; Images from &quot; China &quot; ( easy @-@ to @-@ found ) , the cen@@ sored news published in China showed photos of a check@@ point , on the polic@@ emen the inhabitants mentioned sel@@ ess , whether they had the surveillance app installed . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian ensure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification is required that people will install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you become aware of a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be det@@ ained up to 10 days . &quot;
this is an attack for technological development .
&quot; they have forced to use the people , which are meant for older people . &quot;
this is a form of cap@@ tivity by the rest technology .
we are back in ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from &quot; China &quot; ( within the same rate of redemption ) , it also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which the software may lift the identification requirement of a Windows operating system and therefore un@@ restricted access to the hard drive of the computer . &quot;
after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang will become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
&quot; in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang are potentially a reaction to the instructions of the city of party to minim@@ ize the dis@@ semination of illegal contents . &quot;
&quot; all government authorities , authorities and the party connected facilities including universities and research institutions are oblig@@ ated to follow the instructions of Cyber@@ security office when operating their computers and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; a current report of Freedom House , an American human rights organization , mentioned also these new surveillance methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Uru@@ m@@ qi , a regulation with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs , until 1 August their &quot; personal ID maps , mobile phones , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; in local police . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obvious to identify and destroy any terrorist videos yet . this promotion is wo@@ unded , however , the personality rights of Uru@@ m@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a number of other possible crimin@@ ation , including those who refer to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;
&quot; sleep or death , part 1 : everything sh@@ it after death &quot;

&quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; , &quot; in which the activity is Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane , his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far away from our blue , virtual world you find yourself and stell@@ ar that you are all alone in one place where everything is important . &quot;
&quot; everything has gradually resolved , and un@@ veil@@ ed a truth which is clearly recogni@@ z@@ able from inside and outside . &quot;
one who makes her name all the honor .
one which has st@@ acked up into a list of feelings and squee@@ zed no met@@ aph@@ ors .
&quot; but if you get back the reality again and you behind the scenes - beyond the act@@ ress , the beautiful scenes , and the perform@@ er - turn the characters in essence of flesh and blood , and everything under death . &quot;
&quot; all doubts solve themselves in smoke and you will consciously hur@@ ry you of your existence , even if the earth are on the axis of the we@@ dge . you will clear that you &apos;ve captured here between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone by stone . &quot;
&quot; they have arrested me and my father three times , but this was not yet , so that I would say &quot; My lesson &quot; , &quot; as the boss of the safety service , it form@@ ulate - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot;
he put his power over us under evidence by even destro@@ ying the sim@@ pl@@ est concepts that we knew .
five young people were tor@@ n away from the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest .
it travelled to the city the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; Write .
&quot; all city districts sought after , only my own . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was silent , rainy , at the wrong time , even if I had no high demands placed on a city that is attributed to the arter@@ ies with government security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; in the third night the things had cal@@ med down , after the power supply in the quarter . &quot;
I asc@@ ended the still@@ ness by doing several times &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house da@@ ch .
I heard my voice through the silence res@@ ist .
a few minutes later some of my friends were cour@@ ageous enough to work together .
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we lau@@ gh us to a beautiful image that filled my expectations . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment you become aware that you are fre@@ eing the spirit from the lamp , but it is simply not in the righteous . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; makes you ready to meet us at the military security building . &quot;
he placed on .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can put down - nothing can return to you your voice after you have the whole way to the office of the service serving from the body .
I came there .
&quot; the Ober@@ st Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men , and my father was already there , as I now also . &quot;
&quot; the Ober@@ st Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to speak : &quot; &quot; let me listen to how you &apos;re &apos;@@ ahu Ak@@ bar , or you are only then cour@@ ageous enough to cry , if we are not close . &quot;
his h@@ asser@@ ted eyes were directed towards me .
&quot; and you forget you really , to look into the eyes and not on the ground ! &quot;
&quot; what I did , has nothing to do with courage . &quot;
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building . &quot;
&quot; maybe it lay on my go@@ al@@ ness , van@@ ity ; perhaps in the revolution . &quot;
I was so sure that I answered : &quot; I did not think that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
&quot; and I believe I have never stopped to look in the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest conversation that could have such fat@@ al consequences for me , and yet I regret not a word of what I said . &quot;
&quot; is it in single , and his father is the same with it . &quot;
&quot; his father is the same with it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Gest@@ apo of this hi@@ ding proposition is to me up to now in the nose .
&quot; he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a spiritual torture , which I was subjected to monthly . &quot;
I sh@@ opp@@ ed the farm .
in the first office I leave everything I tr@@ age with me .
&quot; then again through the farm and into the second office , which leads through a course to the individual cells . &quot;
I take all details exactly before I super@@ v@@ ise the space .
otherwise they have probably assigned a larger cell to me this time .
I have to share it with only one another and must put me immediately without waiting for their permission .
&quot; after a few minutes that had felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I laid hold on an old @-@ approved communication method : to hit the wall against the wall . &quot;
&quot; I learned that my cell@@ ular was a &quot; &quot; awakening man &quot; . &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he answered me finally .
&quot; apparently , none of the surrounding cells lay in none of the surrounding cells an enlarged man middle age , who can see me similar and &quot; &quot; Doctor &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in perfect darkness let me know no distinctive fac@@ tions , and doctors are here not ; we are all only numbers . &quot;
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice sounds like my sounds ? &quot;
all the answers to its existence .
perhaps he was placed in one of the major cells .
perhaps he will be heard immediately .
the investig@@ ators had in@@ sured me that she would stay free when I stay .
fan .
&quot; gladly I would have had a scar@@ ce to exp@@ el all these Cro@@ ws , who lab@@ elled to the fruits in the garden of my head . &quot;
&quot; from the distance I still hear it &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it must be approximately 10 pm in the evening ; always at this time the hor@@ rors , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black the colour of closure is , until I saw the yellow light which gave us the Gre@@ ys in person : the Ra@@ ad ( approximately : &quot; Donn@@ er , &quot; An@@ go@@ ung on the 13th S@@ ure of the Quran ) . &quot;
they are here to be heard .
&quot; this was the secret of the secret : to protect the state @-@ security before us and prevent , they speak the tra@@ itor and terrorists in us , they speak their den@@ omin@@ ational dial@@ ect card and distributed the close view of the world &apos;s view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house that is here is not a land ; it is a cur@@ se , which they call co@@ existence to turn the crimin@@ als of their lan@@ s into a hero . &quot;
&quot; I super@@ vised the audi@@ ences and tre@@ ach@@ ery to Abu I@@ mad , a slim and mu@@ ddy man ; at least it comes to me so . &quot;
&quot; he begins a &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; cont@@ empl@@ ation , despite the fac@@ ial expres@@ sions , which begin with him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life , when you decide to protest that stage and to protest that anyway will soon be an end . &quot;
I did not answer .
&quot; I have acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to me , not to answer . &quot;
I can really no longer say exactly when ins@@ ults and fittings after a friendly conversation for me to become an ordinary communication .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
&quot; some voice in me said that I had to get used to get used to be pun@@ ished , although I had done nothing to earn these punishment . &quot;
at punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to te@@ ar me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls the lov@@ ingly &quot; conf@@ ession . &quot;
it begins with an plastic pipe that dates probably from the clo@@ ak .
your hen is rejo@@ iced at your scre@@ aming .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure you with him and you cannot with@@ hold your hor@@ rors . &quot;
&quot; my fear fell by him not enough , why they ref@@ rain the pipe by a cable . &quot;
&quot; in my first celebration I asked myself whether the investig@@ ators had worked once a gar@@ bage dump , or if it belon@@ ged to the normal working equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had to fle@@ w four cable to each other , in order to present ourselves from their vision , great in@@ vention of a giant cab@@ els . &quot;
within a single hour three of them rarely had three of them while I still had in the series .
&quot; I had lost any feeling in my body - and even my voice , why I list@@ ened to cry . &quot;
the Hen@@ ker not@@ ched the cooling and certainly found no favor from it that he is called neighbour to an electri@@ cally charged .
flow flow@@ ed my whole body enough to supply my entire neighborhood .
&quot; my semi @-@ nude body , which lay out on the ground , was the perfect power unit . &quot;
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night .
this must probably have been so much midnight .
I decided to sleep me back ; we say that was my only option .
a few hours left that came to me as minutes .
then the call for dawn .
&quot; the door opens and the dawn fills the room &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; I answered with the voice of an exhaus@@ tive young people , &quot; &quot; my Lord , my Father must be fright@@ ful worries . &quot;
&quot; be silent and get away you , you will be displ@@ aced . &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they had always released me .
where do they lead me ? !
the j@@ ord@@ ic Rap@@ per Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b travels over the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + community to freedom of expression and opposition
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigar@@ ette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was recorded by A@@ man Ma@@ dan , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends the much of his time dr@@ ill@@ ings ; times he slim to his screen , mal to his computer , and again to his couch . &quot;
&quot; however , one can rely on , is a cigar@@ ette between his fingers or its with ni@@ cot@@ ine be@@ fallen lips . &quot;
&quot; he lives in the top floor of his family house , which has ended to them since 1967 ; the year , in which Israel ended up his occupation of the West Bank , and H@@ da@@ i@@ bs his family were forced to fle@@ w out of their village in Palestine in which they lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ en ( approximately : Far@@ mer ) . &quot;
&quot; for now six years H@@ da@@ i@@ b is a passionate activity , which faces the conserv@@ ative majority and asks their old opinions on gender roles , sexuality and freedom of expression through art and Rap@@ id . &quot;
&quot; with his music , often dealing with topics like Ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian refugees . all these topics can not only be found in his hom@@ etown of Am@@ man , but also in cities that suff@@ ice from Damascus in Syria to San@@ aa in Y@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; with his 25 years H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees itself as someone who is not restricted by limits in its mind , and he can feel according to their own statement by people who suffer the devast@@ ating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Y@@ emen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he is not open to it , he defe@@ ats the US @-@ American foreign policy a special circum@@ cis@@ ion . &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to do in war areas , anything that he has to do with his identity as a Palestinian p@@ oul@@ ders of the second generation . &quot; &quot; he himself was born , even if he was born in Jordan , and has never been in Palestine . &quot;
&quot; I do not think of my own living conditions so , st@@ resses h@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; I think that because I am a man , while in the water it sol@@ ves into two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan . in this time it is intended for Muslims , from sunrise until sund@@ own . &quot;
the law also empha@@ sized that public consumption of food is illegal during Ram@@ adan .
&quot; obviously , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness to break with old traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee at a sen@@ ing hot young day has little with protest against Islam . &quot;
&quot; generally speaking the s@@ ut@@ ch , warm coffee and the wa@@ ders of the K@@ ent @-@ cigar@@ ette in the nose , first and foremost of freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky , especially when you thro@@ ws a look into the neighbouring countries . &quot;
&quot; so it is so easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan , water to drink - to do not land in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently the interior of the Jordan Jordan was a show of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a , already for the second time . &quot;
&quot; some parliam@@ ent@@ arians who support the Islamic Action Front - the j@@ ord@@ ship branch of the Muslim Br@@ other@@ hood - ar@@ gu@@ ing that the sexual orientation of the homo@@ sexual in@@ sig@@ nor Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o , contradi@@ ct the cultural and traditional standards of the country and the main reason for the concert . &quot;
&quot; the de@@ pu@@ ties and former spokes@@ person in the Islamic Co@@ alition of D@@ IMA Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N , that the concert was &quot; straight &quot; because of the sexual orientation of the sc@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; many as well as the commitment of the band in affairs like the Arabian spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world be more dangerous acti@@ vism , which represents the old @-@ proven legi@@ timacy of author@@ it@@ arian regimes in the entire region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a the &quot; &quot; progressive supporters of human rights &quot; , &quot; which continues to be decided for an intellectual and cultural plur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement is likely to be probably not simply a @-@ hand rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic , but actually a more evident @-@ out reality in Jordan , which occurs in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs works clearly . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b traditional Gender nor@@ men to Lei@@ be , by bringing his vision of the fate of Arab women who have vo@@ re@@ hel@@ i@@ chen sex . &quot;
the picture shows the sk@@ elet@@ on of an evi@@ d@@ ently balanced woman whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas .
&quot; it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who lost their lives through their hands , which they actually trust . &quot;
over the past few years the number of &apos; volunte@@ ering &apos; has increased - the in@@ official outside .
&quot; human Rights Watch , according to the number of volunteers in 2016 reached its peak ; however , the Jordan &apos;s institutional infrastructure is missing to support the women , the victims of tried and domestic violence have become appropriate to assist . &quot;
&quot; according to a law for break@@ able fighting from 1954 , women who are exposed to the risk of in@@ patient violence , &quot; due to un@@ certain time in prison , and for their release is often a years of bureau@@ crati@@ c effort and the guarantee of the family is needed that the woman has nothing to happen . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is known to do not shy away from themes , which in its country is long as t@@ abo@@ o . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b be@@ stre@@ it@@ et that his work politically is , however , that he is his music , who is full of explicit adher@@ ence to sexuality , freedom and expression , not separate from politics . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Nah@@ ost , man . &quot;
&quot; he became in@@ ordin@@ ated politics , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; in a song called &quot; &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity in attack . &quot;
&quot; in &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot;
&quot; the list of songs that are in the core politically , can be further . &quot;
in March 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b published a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated often :
&quot; you are free , and any other it is also . &quot;
&quot; in the further course of the song , H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market in which one can get , in his words , &quot; what one wants &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ faith , hetero@@ sexuality or homo@@ sexuality . &quot;
&quot; he noticed that hardly any one spoke in Jordan , about the rights of g@@ ay and readers , and that comments on equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + -@@ individuals are still strongly cen@@ sored in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b led an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ an Online@@ Programme Ro@@ ya to remember later that his comments were caught out of the context , conce@@ aled and his opinion were cen@@ sored . &quot;
&quot; on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts , but was only a working version , &quot; he says . &quot;
today H@@ da@@ i@@ b ac@@ quires H@@ da@@ i@@ b open to the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that intoler@@ ance towards homo@@ sexu@@ als is not the Islam .
&quot; he mentioned Abu Nu@@ what , a po@@ et of the eighth century , which still has remained in memory thanks to its homo@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks yourself : when Abu Nu@@ ts , who should once again work on behalf of the pot@@ assi@@ um , in the eighth century it could write openly about homo@@ sexuality , why can you not ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so h@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot;
&quot; in the ha@@ ylo@@ i@@ tic Kingdom , there is nothing new things that the government attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are brought to the silence . &quot;
&quot; recently , recently , in January 2017 , the j@@ ord@@ urian news service took several former government members and members of the teaching association , with the reason they would have expressed concerns in social media critical about the problems which coinci@@ de with the deep in the land . &quot;
&quot; given the concert of H@@ da@@ i@@ bs opinion , it is only the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the real challenge is to effect a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan . &quot;
&quot; for him , progress is a continuous package and taking care . Jordan has won m@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a now for the second time in a row , it looks like s@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , thought and internal changes . he is sure that these changes are held from day to day at the heart of the American society . &quot;
&quot; finally , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , also , from an Arab world without intervention from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he dre@@ amed not only from his work until Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of them to experience them . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region is going through music , art and literature of genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bom@@ bs , streams and on artificial kind . at least he hopes that . &quot;
&quot; until then , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to continue and therefore resistance . &quot;

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan .
these large , extr@@ av@@ ag@@ ant war pu@@ ffs are so fantastic ! ! ! &quot;
there are numerous theories about origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
&quot; you susp@@ ected that there is a variant of tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually covered in August in many areas of To@@ ho@@ cus , and from a time come , in the arm@@ ies of West Japan to the north @-@ east , to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the Em@@ i to force in the kne@@ es . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we could s@@ nap a few great seats , so we have a super view . &quot;
you can only imagine how large these parts are ...
&quot; a common center in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , hosted a two @-@ month exhibition at W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally . &quot;
I looked like again the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two fixed carri@@ ages are just to be seen .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the neb@@ uta festival the only true truth - and in this way a stunning way to spend his summer : &quot;
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Sommer@@ festival in the north of the country .
I was there and I looked at the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 meters high festi@@ vities was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

&quot; rarely , outer appearance and body care were as important as in this story , because they help us maintain the Peru@@ vian youth from crimin@@ ality and to promote an legitimate profession like the hair@@ style . &quot;
&quot; El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us more important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean near the historic center of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where street smoke and illegal drugs . &quot;
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region do not feel secure .
at the same time Peru - how many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
&quot; the trend , the appearance and thus the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Art@@ uro Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , has led to the experienced hands of hair@@ styles that can make these expensive hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the be@@ is@@ ex demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme borders of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of the hairdres@@ sers Bat@@ alla de Barber@@ os &quot; , who has been taking place since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; there are experts to see each other , to show who you can see the ec@@ cent@@ ric L@@ ooks , as you can see in the following video ( other videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Barber@@ os ) . &quot;
&quot; educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , who found themselves in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to convince young people who have to give up their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and instead of bad advice , which allows them to find work . &quot;
&quot; motivated from this activity and the surrounding possibilities have seen do@@ z@@ ens of young people that they can sei@@ ze a job , who is currently in fashion . &quot;
the school offered a special training programme before the March beginning in March and reported about some of her success :
&quot; in 1995 , we were the only specialist school in the church and the district of what we are very proud of because of love for the children we have established this educational community . &quot;
Colombia : Lov@@ em@@ fe to Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ac fighters

&quot; the following article is the published version of the message of the message &quot; commandment to gu@@ err@@ illa , &quot; which has published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot;
this article will be published here in the context of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love letters to people who we know ?
&quot; is it not yet much more important , people who feel disp@@ ers@@ ed , affection ? &quot;
&quot; this question went exactly the two young Colom@@ bian acti@@ vi@@ sts Leonardo P@@ Ã¡r@@ rag@@ a by the Stiftung Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Cr@@ isti@@ an Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth @-@ Foundation is no longer available from the head and inspir@@ ational them to the campaign Cart@@ as p@@ or la re@@ cili@@ aci@@ Ã³n ( letters to reconciliation ) , the young people to write to gu@@ err@@ illa letters . &quot;
&quot; only recently , her country was a place of a historical event and they wanted to contribute their part to it : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had closed a peace agreement with the Gu@@ err@@ illa movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Ar@@ umb@@ iens ) , which forms the conclusions of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; it was the signat@@ ories of the peace contract , as significant , that the Colom@@ bian President JosÃ© Manuel San@@ tos has received the No@@ bel Prize for his understanding of the No@@ bel Peace Prize . &quot;
&quot; however , before the colum@@ bi@@ ans , there is a long way to see from real reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; gu@@ err@@ illa fighters who have lived for many years in illegal bearings , were exposed to a war rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic and around the clock their weapons have to be integrated into life as civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society in turn , which had acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hat@@ red to gu@@ err@@ illa har@@ v@@ eil , these must now take in their ranks and support them to build a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an were convinced that the young colum@@ bi@@ ans would have to join together and help the integration process .
and this is exactly what they did : until now you have written thousands of young people letters - love bot@@ her@@ es in former gu@@ err@@ illa war@@ ri@@ ans to welcome them back in society .
the aim of the campaign are 69@@ 00 letters - one for every former gu@@ err@@ illa war@@ ri@@ or - which should be personally handed over .
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for letters to reconciliation was born on the world summit of No@@ bel Peace Prize who took place in February 2017 in Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ . there were Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an the opportunity to talk just with K@@ ail@@ ash of Sat@@ y@@ ar@@ thi , the 2014 No@@ bel Peace Prize . &quot;
&quot; explained that we love the people we love to write on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day of Lov@@ age , but those forget that they need a lot of necessary . &quot;
&quot; he plain , he continued to share his love with people this year , who needed an urgent commitment . &quot;
&quot; thus , the plan , letters , full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC to write their place in society and have to build a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the dis@@ course of a war history into a common history of peace . &quot;
&quot; so far as part of the campaign , more than 2000 letters were collected . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ era , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ . &quot;
I never imag@@ ined that someone would for@@ give me &apos;
the first 500 letters were passed on 19 March at one of the UN warehouse in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca Region .
&quot; a group of 40 students at the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city council of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the foundation of Bog@@ ot@@ ic@@ ri@@ sts in the camp to convey the letters personally . &quot;
&quot; the members of the ARC set up , as they had done before , to counter the orders of their leaders . &quot;
&quot; but this time they received no prec@@ epts , but letters full of subj@@ ection people from all over the land . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for all involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings can walk in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that in between , the politicians of the President Jim@@ Ã©@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later . &quot;
Sandra Par@@ ra is a co @-@ worker of the Govern@@ or of the Province of Valle del Cau@@ ca descri@@ bing this unforgettable experience :
&quot; after we had passed the letters , a former figh@@ ter led me through the camp of the Gu@@ er@@ illa @-@ fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut , in which the Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ar@@ fighters live ) I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa fighters who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I had afraid to go down , because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ Gran@@ at@@ ov , a de@@ adly weapon in the Dorn@@ bir@@ schen@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; I said it nevertheless and asked : &quot; &quot; hello , what do they do ? &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; I answered on a letter that someone has written me . &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never in my life someone has written something so beautiful , so I answered him . &quot; &quot; I suddenly turned the te@@ ars over the che@@ eks . &quot;
I embr@@ aced him completely and set me next to the gran@@ ulators .
&quot; maybe he was sorry , he was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this struggles , and wanted to help him to write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he never did anything about life than war . he had never been able to join the F@@ ARC , was the only way to keep him and his six brothers before hunger . &quot; I have never thought that anyone would give me for my mistakes . &quot;
&quot; but now I know that there is a society out there , which awaits us with open arms . &quot;
&quot; until now , I have only learned how to deal with weapons . &quot;
&quot; but now where peace re@@ igns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; to the pre@@ lu@@ de came to students , and some leaders of the F@@ ARC to a discussion round . &quot;
the students were all raised up as already war and the F@@ ARC already existed in the Hidden .
&quot; therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC the history of the organization , their ide@@ als and gave an insight into their views on the peace process : for many years , we experienced the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can contribute to the society in this country . &quot;
&quot; for a purpose of this order , it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them . &quot;
Manuela was impressed :
&quot; these people listen so far as never heard and had no elect@@ oral law , and to recognize that people who have seen as monsters and even hate , even people with beautiful emotions which were turned through their life conditions and their environment was very pain@@ ful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality , in which the country is alive , does me hurt . &quot;
&quot; but it comfor@@ ted me that all men - including those who have killed and so much damage , can bring us something to bring us and give a smile and a hug . &quot;
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
&quot; Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the comm@@ ander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ Ã­o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Archbishop of the city of Cal@@ i , following letter : &quot;
the Colom@@ bian was proph@@ esi@@ ed that after the design of peace would reign .
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as there is inequality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are willing to attack the weapons and to protest to their rights . and this is absolutely justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we are now committed by the F@@ ARC to peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , we call all def@@ enders of peace in - regardless of what race , religion or ideology do they belong to all those who dream of a country in the war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrific@@ es , because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those among us who defend life as the basis of existence , are many difficulties . &quot;
&quot; on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; homo@@ sexual and que@@ er people who live in the Cau@@ ca@@ sian region , are exposed to a wide range of haz@@ ards - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and ex@@ tor@@ tion . &quot;
with terror acti@@ vi@@ sts have experienced the reporting of the last few months on the persecution of pregnant men in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya .
but the threat that depends like a di@@ amo@@ is worth over the dor@@ sal LGB@@ T@@ Q community is not only about night .
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ sn@@ y , which dealt with us some of their experiences with us and talked with us about what is happening in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; LGB@@ T@@ Q @-@ humor in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya has been reported in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya , after several months ago , after reports have been published , which have been published violations of torture , torture and killing que@@ er men in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gas@@ eta ; they cast a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities , the susp@@ ected que@@ er men fe@@ asts and they were in secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun . &quot;
&quot; you have brought a Monster to the World &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ woman , was born in Gro@@ sn@@ y and grew up there . &quot;
&quot; since her childhood she felt , she was in reality a woman . &quot;
&quot; when they became growing , you became aware that Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya was not a safe place for them , why she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group v@@ et@@ ail from the sex equ@@ ation of their land@@ lady , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina . &quot;
&quot; from fear to their lives , they went to the US last end . &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I was working as an honor@@ ary hero@@ in at a human rights organization .
&quot; one day I was told me , that someone will need my help . &quot;
&quot; it was a friend of Dag@@ est@@ an , a Trans@@ woman who did in difficulties . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her to help her , he made a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them anywhere on the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no men more in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya that can eliminate this shame ? &quot;
after that the photos of my documents made the round of my documents throughout the W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; when I was just doing a few shopping from the back@@ seat of my car , I heard a male voice : &quot; here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
&quot; when I turned , I feel something in my body , but I did nothing . &quot;
&quot; then I list@@ ened to a sentence , but this time in the Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya , &quot; how long do you still want the family to work , you Sch@@ and@@ en@@ eck ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
&quot; I just know that there was a young man , no 30 years old . &quot;
then I lost consciousness and w@@ oke up the last end of the hospital in the hospital .
&quot; apparently , some women had gotten everything to get and started . &quot;
the man was cap@@ tiv@@ ated .
the women had called a ambulance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two keywords in my right pul@@ mon@@ ary .
OC Media : in what n@@ oul@@ try have you been laid - in the men or women ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name dr@@ on ; but the doctor arose and laid me for the women . &quot;
I am very grateful for it .
&quot; when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I got it with fear ; it was a mus@@ c , a cold @-@ cas@@ ein name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him that he has been respec@@ t@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month in hospital .
last February I got threats .
&quot; they cri@@ ed me , wrote me - related , stran@@ gers , some completely unknown . &quot;
this was the beginning of a night@@ s@@ &apos; .
my family was visited by neighbors and some remote relatives .
&quot; asking me to send me back to Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya , to prove it all was a lie . &quot;
&quot; they set absurd demands : some said to me , I must prove it up without the streets running ; others wanted that I had not changed in the official TV in Gro@@ sn@@ y and say that I was not changed my sex , that everything was just fl@@ our , and Photoshop . &quot;
I have gr@@ illed size C - what should I say in television ?
OC Media : how did your family tries to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it is still hard for her .
some older people said once my mother on the road .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; You have brought a mon@@ ster to the world that not only your family , but the whole Republic is ash@@ amed . &quot;
&quot; we cannot upgrade , because you are a dev@@ out woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot;
&quot; my mother became too much , and she lay down a kn@@ itting around the neck . &quot;
luck@@ ily they came to neighbours and delivered them .
I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later under the window a car with t@@ apped window wash@@ ers and a number@@ ing plate with a 95 dr@@ on .
&quot; once it was the third time , I was clear that there was something la@@ zy . &quot;
my traffic@@ kers friends over@@ test the numer@@ ic signs - it turned out that I was per@@ sec@@ uted .
OC Media : how are you bra@@ ve ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of acti@@ vi@@ sts .
&quot; for security reasons , I do not want to give their names , but I will say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with her help I left the country , but then it happened somewhat un@@ belief . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
just before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SI@@ M card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
&quot; I bought her , without register without notice , without anything . &quot;
I broke my old SI@@ M card and cast them into the tr@@ ash .
came to and check@@ out into the hotel .
the number was on a stran@@ ger .
I put the SI@@ M card into my mobile phone .
&quot; in the moment I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; &quot; you believe not about , you believe in safety , just because you left the country ? &quot;
&quot; our people already know , in which place you put . you even know your room number . &quot;
just to prove it : it is the number 115 .
can you imagine ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; however , about the sex equ@@ ation we don &apos;t talk , this is a table theme . &quot;
some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements still tr@@ age me in me .
&quot; so very I also wish , this comfor@@ ting barrier can I not overcome . &quot;
&quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with camera , I actually give me effort to look like the person to look out of their past - therefore to my male form . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends , those who have stayed in ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I was able to report a report in Washington last week .
for the needed I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya .
I spoke with someone who spent a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he told that during Ram@@ adan no people were arrested and tor@@ tured but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait and he closed a new wave .
most likely they are now focusing on family and relatives .
&quot; with this I mean , they probably invite the relatives before they take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end require a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honour &quot; has experienced &quot; through the blood of satisfaction . &quot;
OC Media : are even more weak@@ ened men in these sec@@ recy ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : a famili@@ y of me says , there would not be very many . &quot;
&quot; if , then above all those who have no enough relatives or who were dropped out of their relatives , to face Kad@@ y@@ rows . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they will be held there , so that you can present them later as terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say : should they be lifted up , they will show their bodies on TV and claim them , they would have attacked some village or a military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not simply disappear , but deliber@@ ately supp@@ ressed in order to radi@@ alize . &quot;
OC Media : is it just a mut@@ ation or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just have someone who had ar@@ gu@@ ed for a half months in ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard .
there was since then nothing new of them .
they simply have taken them back .
&quot; and so @-@ called Lord , this person was by himself when these people were taken away . &quot;
&quot; until now , they were not presented as band@@ its , so far there were no reports . we susp@@ ect that such actions are possible . &quot;
why otherwise you have not allowed these people to shave ?
&quot; do you know if these per@@ secu@@ tions and ab@@ duc@@ tions of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , already in the past ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I had my hair always long .
in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya I had a Bob .
I believe before 2003 I was already known in Gro@@ sn@@ y when I lived there - and I never had problems .
in the Ernst !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sh@@ aria was considered , I never had problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , back then it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia originally wanted to lead us to the &quot; &quot; civilian ari@@ zation &quot; , &quot; finally , it ultimately has thrown back into the St@@ one@@ age . &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were added : I had colored eyelashes , carried red@@ hren@@ je@@ ans and short t@@ ops . &quot;
the Department of Safety of Sh@@ aria has never led me just a hair .
&quot; in front of the Russian Theatre in Gro@@ sn@@ y there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people like me . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several benches were standing , and all the city knew ; they knew why men , young people , there . &quot;
we have never been en@@ forced .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a re@@ application : Khar@@ da ma Khar@@ da . that means : &quot; Sp@@ otto does not say about the un@@ happiness of another .
&quot; you often say it to children , if the sick about sick . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : so they just have their eyes closed before you , because they believed , you are sick ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : yes .
&quot; they have never been corru@@ pted , never so@@ ased and never be@@ aten . &quot;
OC Media : how long did this Gn@@ ome time ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row came upon the plan .
&quot; as he was appointed Minister of Prime Minister , he began speaking on TV on mor@@ als . &quot;
&quot; he does not speak about us per se , but mainly on the behaviour of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , one could feel like the people in the city started to change . &quot;
&quot; who previously suffered , and had suffered , saw you once upon once with Arg@@ wo@@ hn . &quot;
in time I leave Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya .
&quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel how the situation in the Republic grew steadily . &quot;
OC Media : what activity do you go now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I did not spend much - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the US are not much .
&quot; apart from that , I am still active as acti@@ vis@@ tin . &quot;
&quot; currently , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women . &quot;
I commun@@ er with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize te@@ ac@@ ups , meetings , I gi@@ fted it to the hospital and help them to get essence . &quot;
I have no c@@ ents for this .
&quot; I have discovered these people myself , when I sail@@ ed hi@@ ding places . &quot;
I am Muslims and wants to help those who need help .
OC Media : contribute to Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : this is al@@ bern .
&quot; thus , nature , this has nothing to do with religion at all . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as Che@@ ese , who wish you with foam in front of the mouth , that there is no co@@ ils with them . &quot;
&quot; the Dag@@ est@@ ans have which cab@@ lec@@ ars have who , the Russians have also which ; on the whole planet they are - but &quot; not in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I come from there , that is why it is unpleasant for me to hear it . &quot;
here I come here so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practic@@ ing Muslims who go into the mosque and during Ram@@ adan .
&quot; you know , many think of transition to men who love men , and they believe that you will be sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a tru@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different types of sensation in order to be accurate , different life @-@ settings . &quot;
for me it is the most important to feel me in my own skin and not ash@@ amed me for my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
&quot; sorry I &apos;m sorry that I will be here so personally , but my final intimate relationship is now already longer than a year ago . &quot;
and I am not sad for this - I just don &apos;t know that I am myself .
local groups war@@ n before an increase of self @-@ mor@@ den within the Arab @-@ ar@@ az@@ i community in Iran
the Irish Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffered under an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
since the last months there has been a strong rise in self @-@ mor@@ nings .
the photo of Arab workers in Iran was made available from the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .

&quot; the self @-@ bus@@ tion of a man called J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August on the du@@ ck situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran , which is characterized by poverty and unemployment , in the spotlight . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he dwelt in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the southwest of Iran .
&quot; he laugh@@ ed under anxiety , depression , and he sho@@ cked himself for his own assistance to come to the im@@ position for his family , so Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; a YouTube shared video was held the moments when he had puri@@ fied herself , firmly . &quot;
&quot; some people quickly managed to delete the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ eg@@ han@@ i hospital in the town of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; local sources , the com@@ bus@@ tion were so strong that doctors could do nothing more . &quot;
he died a short time later .
&quot; it was not the only one su@@ ic@@ ide that arose in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i minority , and acti@@ vi@@ sts before place war@@ n that even more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights announces that this month some other - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ de Ban@@ i Tam@@ im . &quot;
&quot; their stories have a thing in common : there were all the family of family , hel@@ pl@@ ess and un@@ capable due to the persecution of the Iranian government , hel@@ pl@@ ess and in@@ capable to feed their families and start a safe work . &quot;
Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region , in which a large part of which in Iran live Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community , was sc@@ ared from a profound economic crisis , which makes it the native Arab population difficult to settle their li@@ vel@@ i@@ hood . &quot;
&quot; from a century ago , the Arabic Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predomin@@ antly autonomous regions in Iran until the P@@ ahl@@ avi @-@ Mon@@ archy took over power and took great efforts to end ethnic autonomy in the whole of Iran . &quot;
&quot; in Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the biggest in Iran in the coming oil and gas fields , as well as some of the most valuable and most valuable commercial areas for agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to grow slow , and the local population gets little of this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often the victim of untreated diseases , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime is denied ren@@ eg@@ az@@ i @-@ Arabs systematically work stations in local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry . &quot;
&quot; the government also has a large number of dem@@ men built , the waters of the Arab regions in the Persian areas where the provinces are Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , K@@ erman and G@@ ho@@ m . &quot;
these dem@@ me have led only to devast@@ ate the devast@@ ation in the region through dr@@ y@@ ness and to destroy local farming as well as the fish and palm oil industry .
unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ zi youth ceased to 81 % .
&quot; NO@@ UR Mo@@ h@@ ammed P@@ ur , the Iranian @-@ Director for co @-@ operation , work and social welfare , announces that 5 % of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is , who have completed a job , the primary school completed , 55 % a further school completed and 45 % have a university degree . &quot;
a systematic strategy ... that is aimed to destroy the spirit of national resistance
&quot; Kar@@ im Doh@@ im@@ i , an Irish Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ Human Rights in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and racial @-@ related discrimination &quot; , &quot; resulted in a &quot; high rise &quot; of masturbation among the young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ men . &quot;
&quot; Doh@@ im@@ i said that particularly unemployment has become more recently worse . because of this , a combination of a high number of in Ah@@ wa@@ z , newly @-@ coming , and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the setting process : &quot;
&quot; since the function@@ aries and institutions is preferred non @-@ Arab labour force , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i is de@@ du@@ cted to access work opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs , and force them to earn their li@@ vel@@ i@@ hood outside their homeland Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to hide their predecess@@ ors and sur@@ names to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i , as even Arabian names in the workplace are not toler@@ ated , wel@@ ded because the speaking of the Arabic language or the wearing Arabian clothing . &quot;
&quot; given the given circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i have to bear , propose human rights activ@@ ist alarm before the situation is explosive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world is awakening and it takes note .
the main reason for su@@ ic@@ ide is imm@@ oral depression .

&quot; why I &apos;m not talking to the femin@@ ism identi@@ fiers , even with the inter@@ se@@ ct@@ al &quot;

&quot; the following article is a revised version of the statement made by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i , and originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as website . the article was the subject of several discussions , where many different positions have been expressed . &quot;
you can read in the comments under the original text .
&quot; when I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women are responding to women - especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ se@@ cul@@ ale fem@@ ini@@ sts - with Fr@@ ust . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
&quot; they even lay well thought , scientific and social arguments against me , why I should be femin@@ ist and why we generally need to be both femin@@ ist * . &quot;
&quot; for example , women today despite the same formation still less money than men . &quot;
that women are still under strict observation when it comes about what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
that violence against women is a global epidem@@ ic .
&quot; or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women encounter sooner or later in various areas of life to a smooth blan@@ ket , and that discrimination based on the sex is still moving across the many different countries and fai@@ ths . &quot;
all this is aware and known .
I am convinced of it and I do double and triple .
I am a black woman .
&quot; and yet , when I &apos;m talking on skin colour , on rac@@ ism , on black CIS women , on black women in the LGB@@ TI community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; when I talk about se@@ gregation when we are p@@ onder@@ ing , mentally , and ver@@ bal . if I are considering some white fem@@ ini@@ sts and white inter@@ se@@ ct@@ al fem@@ ini@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; but nevertheless , all of them agree that women - all women should come together in order to up@@ lift their voices , and &apos; K@@ umb@@ aya to sing my Lord &apos; to reach equal rights ( some ) of women . &quot;
but they don &apos;t want to talk about sexu@@ alised violence an institu@@ tion@@ alised form rac@@ ist violence that we are black women on two @-@ fold manner .
or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cs and origin of origin less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background of the school are referred to as white girls because of obvious integration problems .
&quot; or that women are exposed in black spher@@ es and women with a migration background to a higher risk , domestic violence and violence suffer from a partnership , as white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , I want that all women do not have the same rights ; on the other hand , I cannot join forces in any skin colour ; on the other hand , I can consider myself as black woman , in whose center the white wife stands , which affects both the gender and skin colour of a person . &quot;
&quot; I am exhausted and I will not fight for my belonging in a white @-@ femin@@ ist oriented spher@@ es , which has always rejected me and countless other black women over and over again . &quot;
&quot; So@@ jour@@ ner stopped in 1851 in her speech : &quot; &quot; I am not a woman ? &quot; and I also know me to maintain an ideology , in which the black woman is a human and margin@@ alized being . &quot;
&quot; I thre@@ w me to join me , which also absor@@ b myself through cultural appropri@@ ation of our customs and customs , to advance its eg@@ oc@@ entri@@ c program . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer try to put white women on the importance of the over@@ cuts of skin colour and sex . for some of them will continue to remain the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to reward them for a better . &quot;
&quot; although the intercultural femin@@ ism was founded to give women from different her@@ ences and borders themselves from the white femin@@ ism , is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in its name . &quot;
&quot; I draw it to me full of femin@@ ism and join me the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was launched for my dark skin and my status as wife , rather than a white @-@ femin@@ ist paradi@@ gm that is so stub@@ born as a new phenomenon is celebrated . &quot;
&quot; now it is more important than ever , that we will define black women about our own ideas and embar@@ k into the spher@@ es which are created by us for us . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the Book Afri@@ c@@ ana wom@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves by focusing on our own way and in which the cultural , spiritual , spiritual , physical , and even the spiritual elements can be re@@ vered : &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ se@@ cul@@ ale fem@@ ini@@ sts immediately will call , after they have read these lines , please inform yourself about the hy@@ po@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected . &quot;
in a bl@@ ur@@ ist environment I can asc@@ end black women and women of other cultures because in this paradi@@ gm I exist .
I will be recognized for my dark skin and due to my existence as a woman as part of this paradi@@ gm .
&quot; I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment where my life was neither sur@@ passed , nor ignored . &quot;

Paragu@@ ays women and their difficult fight against violence

the following article is the shorten@@ ed and modified version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ jer ( # wheat ) that reported on violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to the protection of the persons concerned .
&quot; a polic@@ eman said A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez , that they had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , their ex@@ co , who had become violent against violent . &quot;
&quot; since the end of her relationship had some time passed and the police said , their statement would be put to the acts , but more could not do . &quot;
&quot; as another woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena , due to Mis@@ cell@@ ing , also take advantage of the ac@@ quires display of A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez . &quot;
some days later the second woman moved their ad .
to break the Teu@@ fel@@ ine of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women do not have a display at all , they do not receive support from the state in general . &quot;
&quot; in many cases the women are also dependent on the men which they mis@@ erable . this explains why only 20 % of all women , ad@@ mit , to ad@@ mit , victims of violence , not at all with the enforcement authorities . &quot;
&quot; inhal@@ ation and Statisti@@ c 2 In@@ visible Mis@@ sions and a legal system , which is nothing sub@@ n@@ ou@@ t@@ 3 Paraguay &apos;s laws : good approach , def@@ ective implementation and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to determine how many women really mis@@ ses , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , research , a social @-@ scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various information and reports , which will not even ans@@ ise the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; however , the figures available are however al@@ ar@@ ming . &quot;
in 2015 the District Prosec@@ ut@@ or 9@@ 600 show for domestic violence . at 70 % of it it went to violence against women .
86 % of the ads in police came from women .
there were over 5000 ads because of domestic violence in the peace of peace . also here 86 % of the ads of women .
&quot; in the ads , 40 % of women were that they were physically mis@@ led , 55 % of women spoke of mental mis@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; however , these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; according to indications of the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s minister@@ ial institution in Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di are actually shown only a few of these criminal off@@ ences . &quot; on every woman who re@@ funded in Paraguay because of psych@@ ic failure , come 9 women who do not do this . &quot;
&quot; every woman who re@@ funded because of bodi@@ ly distr@@ acting display , come two women who do not do this , explained to the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay there is no own off@@ ences in Paraguay , the enforcement authorities can not be adequ@@ ately documented how many women are mur@@ dered every year from their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; only until August 2016 , journalists have at least 12 cases of women in the country alone . &quot;
coordin@@ ator of human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were mur@@ dered by their current or former partners .
&quot; according to their estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman was due to violence by men . &quot;

invisible mis@@ tions and a legal system that has nothing to be under@@ taking
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z the fixed friend of Carlos Vera was , he insi@@ sted that she called his name to him all of her former friends . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning she did not want to do it , but then after . this should they be forever . &quot;
&quot; today Mari@@ ana 28 years old and no more with Carlos took place . but two years she carried the psych@@ ic force on the one hand - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severe recogni@@ z@@ able : &quot;
I have never thought that I would once again have been victims of failure .
&quot; when I read earlier about it , I always thought that the only women are happening to sub@@ mis@@ sive , because they decei@@ ve themselves of violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that I would never happen .
Mari@@ ana us@@ te social media to report about the Mis@@ cell@@ ing through Carlos Vera .
&quot; without name to name , they wrote posts on Facebook where they described their ins@@ ults and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated . &quot;
&quot; many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked the hand against them and conf@@ essed that his behaviour was also a form of failure . &quot;
&quot; other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana , why they had fallen so long by Carlos and not left him earlier . &quot;
&quot; it seemed almost like so , when they wanted to say that victims of failure at least had some complic@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos that is not from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay , to prove that her former partner she sm@@ iled her . &quot;
Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te CRE@@ O ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that consists of women all victims of mis@@ cellaneous .
&quot; in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as case everything started with psych@@ ic failure .
&quot; her weal@@ thy partner , it finally got to convince them that it was worth@@ less . &quot;
then he began to beat her .
&quot; Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as displays with the authorities at no result and also of their relatives , she received no support . &quot;
&quot; it led a process against its former partners who developed into an in@@ scr@@ utable legal battle between Paraguay and their home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of their former partner . &quot;
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach to def@@ ective implementation
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but not applied . &quot;
&quot; the display of failure is a way of resist@@ ors and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ciary , &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen genuin@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organisation for women in Paraguay , also sees major problems in the application of laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Parliament was discussed in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Parliament under the has@@ ht@@ ag # Por@@ El@@ las ( # FÃ¼r@@ th ) . &quot;
&quot; this ha@@ ht@@ ag and the movement of Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # non @-@ Less ) are part of a campaign on Twitter , which is supported by Am@@ nest@@ y International . &quot;
the original bill of the law considers to explain Fem@@ izi@@ d to a self @-@ violent criminal insi@@ sted and harder to pun@@ ish as it already is in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia the case .
&quot; thus , the leg@@ est@@ text was altered in some points to also gain members of the law that are fe@@ ared towards the de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions that are currently b@@ anned in Paraguay with up to five years . &quot;
&quot; the original bill had been planned , most of the ( bureau@@ crati@@ c and economic ) processing costs which have to bear the victims of violence in the present time when they simply concei@@ ve and provide a secure accommodation , to submit their state . &quot;
&quot; Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that law is not effective unless the leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ors are no adequate funds available for this : &quot;
in Paraguay is seen failure as a part of inter@@ personal relationships .
&quot; here , a re@@ thinking must take place , so that violence is no longer considered a little Nor@@ mal . &quot;
&quot; whoever talks about this facts is guilty , and contributes to the perpet@@ rat@@ ors of the perpet@@ rat@@ ors . &quot;
we have to refund such a long ad until failure is no longer considered normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 the law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate . previously , parts of the law has been altered . however , among other things , the partners was painted in cases of domestic violence to reconciliation . &quot;
the opinions on the changes go apart .
the section on reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for the ag@@ gres@@ sor and to attack his victim again .
&quot; the pet@@ ting of words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law is considered a great return . &quot;
this article is the shorten@@ ed and processed version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ jer ( # wheat ) that reported on violence against women in Paraguay .

independent media in O@@ man will continue to ban an newspaper on the prohibition of a newspaper
&quot; this website was locked due to a resolution of the information system , is locked on the homepage of the Forbidden newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; more than one year ago , the om@@ ic authorities have joined the independent Arabic newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of its reporting on corruption in the sult@@ an . &quot;
&quot; You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison , where he was one of the years of age . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Za@@ her Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and put before judgment , but later they came back . &quot;
&quot; O@@ man has been governed by Sult@@ an Q@@ ab@@ us ib@@ n S@@ aid , who came to power after he had his father , S@@ aid ib@@ n Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a state @-@ empire . &quot;
&quot; since then , he d@@ ressed , in addition to his role as the only sult@@ an , the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Defence Minister , Foreign Minister , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for the planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the rule of the sult@@ ans is characterized by the har@@ ming efforts of security forces , in particular of domestic intelligence , including press freedom , to restrict and human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blog@@ ger and other acti@@ vi@@ sts , in@@ tim@@ id and ar@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; the authorities limit peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights systematically , and citizens , also acti@@ vi@@ sts , to express their views on the public affairs of the country , such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot;
the attack on the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper its closure and the imprisonment of three of their editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper in which since its inc@@ eption in 2007 on corruption in O@@ man ( an absolute mon@@ archy ) has been reported until it was b@@ anned by the authorities in August 2016 .
&quot; on 28 July 2016 security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i , Che@@ ese @-@ Chief of Az@@ am@@ n , firm , after in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 , there was a article entitled &quot; high @-@ level parties &quot; hands of the judi@@ ciary &quot; and interference from high @-@ level officials in judicial decisions . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government acc@@ used to cancel the judge of the Supreme Court in O@@ man to stand under pressure to up@@ lift up a judgment in a inheritance . &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 Wil@@ her Al @-@ Abr@@ i was arrested in Za@@ her Al @-@ Abr@@ i , Member of the Board of Directors , loaded from the ISS , and taken on his arrival from security forces . &quot;
on 9 August 2016 the ISS received the Vice @-@ Editor @-@ Editor @-@ Chief of You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j that acts after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is soli@@ ds as a Editor @-@ in @-@ chief .
&quot; the newspaper was closed in in@@ definite period after the information sm@@ ini@@ ster had given the statement that &quot; the publication and dis@@ semination of the newspaper on any way , including online , starting from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 the trial took place in Mas@@ k@@ at the first hearing in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i . &quot;
the Court condem@@ ned the three journalists to prison @-@ sent@@ ences as well as the final closure of the newspaper .
&quot; Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condem@@ ned among other things because of disturb@@ ance of public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining of the state &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty of infringement of one of the audience @-@ bot@@ hers and to be guilty .
Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three @-@ year prison and bank@@ du@@ es at the height of each 3000 om@@ anic R@@ ial ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . moreover it was published a one @-@ year profession against the two journalists .
&quot; Al @-@ G@@ i was condem@@ ned to a year prison and a bank@@ ment in height of 1000 R@@ ial ( 2600 US dollars ) , after making use of &quot; an information network for spreading material that could pose a danger to public order &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for Al @-@ Abr@@ i a damages in the amount of 5000 om@@ anic R@@ ial ( 13 000 US dollars ) , and he was released before the end of August 22 , 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the Ap@@ pe@@ al Tribunal talked to Al @-@ Abr@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , condem@@ ned Al @-@ Ha@@ j to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i to six months of prison . &quot;
&quot; Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i was released on 10 April 2017 after the imprisonment of its sixth period in Mas@@ k@@ at . Al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison , where he was imprisonment for his age . &quot;
the Ap@@ pe@@ al Tribunal also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Affairs at the &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; newspaper .
&quot; despite the decision of judgment , Az@@ am@@ n will go back again the paper continues to be suspended through the om@@ anic government . &quot;
&quot; on January 8 , the Information sm@@ ini@@ ster was sent a statement by which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the information sm@@ ini@@ ster signed a further statement in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and presented himself the ministers for once again against the decision of the appeal , published the publication of the newspaper . &quot;
the continuing closing of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where in O@@ man has been viol@@ ated the freedom of the press .
&quot; for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country . &quot;
&quot; due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the ar@@ rest of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ anic authorities are still not willing to make an end to the extensive violation of the press freedom . &quot;
&quot; the Golf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) demands the om@@ ic authorities on : &quot;
1st You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condi@@ tionally release ;
2 . create a safe environment for the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper to enable their journalists to their work ;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ under@@ standings
Ran@@ j@@ it war@@ er 2016 in Zambia ; it takes place with its consent
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media . this is a growing area that is one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
&quot; there are two reasons for the need for medical research , there are two reasons : for an lacking in the offer of global health , many medicines and vacc@@ ines which cover the special medical need on the African continent . &quot;
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis and mal@@ aria have more serious impact than elsewhere , and lack of investment for research on these diseases are a big problem . &quot;
&quot; secondly , research , which is conducted by African scientists themselves , in building up its own research capacity in Africa . a major role in science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it war@@ er is director of the centr@@ al@@ ab@@ ors in the centre of the research of inf@@ ectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , especially when the AIDS epidem@@ ic was the first serious impact on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Louis@@ iana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as a post@@ doctoral at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself decided on HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ bian health system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. war@@ er talks about the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ under@@ standings of the media on these research . &quot;
( disclaimer : Dr. war@@ er speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it war@@ er R@@ W : at the moment the focus of my work is on the use of research results . I support the sam@@ bian national programme for anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy ( ART ) with lab tests .
&quot; in addition , I just got a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ o@@ gens . &quot;
G@@ V : what do you think is the important current knowledge of knowledge in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
R@@ W : there are no basic research here . we only put solutions to have developed elsewhere .
&quot; this must change , otherwise we will always remain receiver instead of being ma@@ cher . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that we get , are often used in our surroundings not well , and sometimes it is impossible to use it here . &quot;
G@@ V : where does the financing and support come from ?
is they sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
R@@ W : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are very well supported .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who come back or move here , because the financing and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot;
G@@ V : how is the research infrastructure ?
which obstacles are there in your routine research work that you do not have before ?
R@@ W : the basic infrastructure does not correspond to the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
G@@ V : how is the opinion of the public on science and scientists in Africa ?
&quot; R@@ W : there are already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods . &quot;
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; G@@ V : how big is your opinion on the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus , and how can we support development ? &quot;
R@@ W : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students from all ages .
&quot; there is need for special scientific education , starting in every age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer sciences , big data , study of space , health care ( non @-@ borne and cont@@ agi@@ ous diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it . &quot;
&quot; G@@ V : can you describe the pros and cons of Life as scientists in Africa against Western countries , based on your experience ? &quot;
&quot; R@@ W : often , it is the limited speed , things to do , and the easy access to scientific expertise , which present here challenges . &quot;
&quot; the system that magazines will be available only against payment ( the so called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limited the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; Se@@ eber@@ ger producers will change global food production
&quot; this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky appeared originally on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports on the solutions for environmental problems worldwide . &quot;
Frank Mor@@ ton bre@@ eds in the USA since the 1980s .
&quot; his company offers 114 sorts , such as out@@ red@@ ge@@ ous , the first plant that has grown from NASA ast@@ ron@@ aut in the space and consume . &quot;
&quot; almost 20 years Mor@@ tons of work has been working only by its own deposits and the question , how many sal@@ aries he can get limits . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he got that more and more sal@@ ads were patented and that he could not continue to use them further . &quot;
&quot; patents g@@ old are not only for individual varieties , but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green or curved leaves . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , more and more such patents have been registered on ever more plants such as grain - or cart@@ els . because of this trends , plant breeding and experts are committed to food safety for the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as passionate about a mill@@ en@@ nia of an mill@@ en@@ nia of ancient tradition , Mor@@ ton is still salad , but it needs to be more and more and more restrictions on the basis of this work . &quot;
&quot; it is , as would lie in a river a b@@ oul@@ try that I have to p@@ ump@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; so we have to do that now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think that these patents go on sal@@ ads . &quot;
&quot; and if they stand before judgment , no one can breed any more new sal@@ ts , because all the characteristics are patented . so he makes it as good as possible and try to breed those characteristics which he wants . &quot;
&quot; however , it is very careful and stri@@ ves to use no material that is being protected as intellectual property . &quot;
he also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the US and everywhere in the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; breed ) .
&quot; ast@@ ron@@ aut of the International Human@@ station ISS have red red@@ mer@@ sal@@ at the Sor@@ te Out@@ ri@@ ge@@ ous in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station bre@@ d and eaten there . there will be tested , whether plants can be grown in space . &quot;

&quot; it is no coinci@@ dence that this name is rather like this , when the movement came from the IT area and not from the plant breeding . &quot;
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; Se@@ ed ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software . &quot;
&quot; it was launched to live in order to ensure that some plant types and gene not are being protected as intellectual property , and so are permanently used for plant breeding . &quot;
&quot; as part of the initiative , briefly O@@ ssi , the US bre@@ eder can undertake to use that others can freely use of them . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and to sell it . &quot; open source &quot; &quot; breeders allow only others to breed with their seed , and it will not immediately exp@@ elled them - two aspects that are b@@ anned or written by many plant hol@@ dings . &quot;
do@@ z@@ ens breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014 .
sc@@ af@@ folding prospects
&quot; for the em@@ eri@@ ed Professor of the University of Wis@@ cons@@ in @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ssi @-@ Vor@@ spiel , Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control over the seed and the opportunity to breed new plants , both important for food safety and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; seed plays a role in greater contex@@ ts such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over nutrition and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eder would try , the latter not or only little to use , making seeds with natural resistance . &quot;
&quot; Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphasises that the &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; movement does not work with gene@@ tically modified crops . &quot;
&quot; all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , cor@@ k , gent@@ leman , or not , from ecological agriculture , or not . &quot; in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over the seeds from Chem@@ China and Syn@@ gent@@ a and Mon@@ san@@ to and Bayer will also know that in August or September 2016 , we should know that the way it is bre@@ d about how this vegetables is bre@@ d . &quot;
nutrition sovereig@@ ns without seeds is not possible .
&quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative will also commit themselves to ensure that their seed will continue to be freely available . with this , their approach in contrast to this , seed and plant characteristics are to be patented . &quot;

&quot; O@@ ssi suppor@@ ter ar@@ gues that the future of food supplies is at risk , since the available outdoor pool is always available due to the always numerous wer@@ dation intellectual property rights to plant material , which therefore always adapted to shr@@ inking . &quot;
&quot; Claire Lu@@ by , who is director of O@@ ssi , has engaged in their doctoral thesis with gene@@ tics in car@@ r@@ ots and their availability . she found out that about a third of all boxes are being protected as intellectual property , making it not usable for plant bre@@ eder either at all or within it . &quot;
&quot; for other plants there are such estimates not yet , but experts as Lu@@ by susp@@ ect that mass @-@ built plants such as wheat in still largely styl@@ ed style are patented as a salad or car@@ r@@ ots . &quot;
a question of view
&quot; plants will be bre@@ d that they are targeted characteristics - of such , through which their tastes or their color improves up to such , due to which they ins@@ ist in certain environments or diseases such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
&quot; opponents of patent properties to plant properties point out that the available plant material for bre@@ eder passes through ever more patents . genetic diversity is currently un@@ necessary than ever before , since the changed conditions in climate change are much worse . &quot;
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ speaker Car@@ ly S@@ ca@@ du@@ to , that genetic diversity is generally important and also critical for Mon@@ san@@ tos activities . with a total of four foreign banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , the company is committed to maintaining the genetic diversity . &quot;
&quot; however , it contradi@@ cts the view that intellectual property develop other breeders , as &quot; patents and protection of plant vari@@ etal innovations . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow , as soon as the patent expi@@ red . &quot;
often helping these instructions to get others with another method to get the same result .
&quot; such protection inhi@@ bits innovation not , but promotes them by providing the public more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ ton sees the different : 20 years to wait , until a patent expi@@ res , certainly not innovations . &quot;
&quot; and if you are waiting to be waiting for a long time to grow , which are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , if you have lost the battle . &quot;
&quot; but the main argument for mor@@ ton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and it should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither the time nor money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ ary incentives are not attractive for us . &quot;
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; that is what we drive , and it won &apos;t be impossible if we can not continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; overall , Mor@@ ton has bot@@ her@@ ed itself on the concept to patent plants : &quot; &quot; we create the characteristics not really itself . &quot;
the plants make them ourselves and as bre@@ eder we finally have no idea how the plants do .
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; for Carol De@@ ppe , plant in@@ tim@@ id@@ ine in the US @-@ State Oregon and O@@ ssi &apos;s committee , there is another key aspect of plant breeding : &quot; &quot; who is a variety of plant breeding , and also re@@ ared its own values into them . &quot;
&quot; who believes in industrial agriculture with large cour@@ ty@@ ards and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , for their cultivation mass@@ aging her@@ bi@@ zi@@ de , bre@@ d in his varieties of this concept of agriculture . &quot;
my concept is just a hur@@ ry . &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than B. Mon@@ san@@ to are patents , create it most smaller seed companies , even without patents survive , either reject it or keep it for too expensive and therefore not rewar@@ ding or both is the case . &quot;
the independent plant breeders Frank Mor@@ ton is looking for in his breeding garden .
photo by Karen Mor@@ ton .
&quot; Mor@@ ton is also the view that bre@@ eder by the A@@ void of pesti@@ cides were innovative : &quot; it looks like I with my efforts to produce new , stronger than corporations , the patented . &quot;
&quot; I need constantly new material for my catalogue , as I know that my competitors are selling my varieties in a couple of years ago , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent one is just 20 years ahead of competition , what makes it very nice for my opinion quite simply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; while the United States seem to be leaders in the &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; breeding leader , but the concept is now growing fast all over the world . &quot;
&quot; in India the centre for sustainable agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the area of resources , an &quot; open source plant breeding program , working together with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties to meet certain demands . &quot;
it also supports them to come to &quot; open source &quot; seed and sell their own .
&quot; the German organisation Agreement col is working on an &quot; Open @-@ source &quot; license , which eventually is a form@@ ell@@ ere and legally binding form of the O@@ ssi obligation for breeders in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ( regulations for the breeding vary from country to country , which can not simply become one of one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 the Executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declar@@ es that conventional plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . thus , it speaks against the present practice of the European patent application , patents applied to conventional plants . &quot;
&quot; however , a statement is not yet a law ; it is now on the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organisation Hi@@ v@@ os hosted a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operator of seeds and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn something about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the global trend towards the pat@@ enting of seed . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; Program for &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; Se@@ eber@@ ger Systems explains that the organisation is currently taking a global alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; seed systems , for the planned next year of the official start @-@ up . &quot;
&quot; a con@@ sortium of environmental protection and development groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit @-@ project organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on ero@@ sion , technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database of seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Knight Foundation and others - published a report as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and other - a report published . it represents that farmers will need to share seed and improve the seed policy so that a stable supply of food can be ensured . &quot;
&quot; in the report , the importance of a diverse , local supply with seeds will be empha@@ sized for sustainable food systems - a connection , by the Lu@@ by of O@@ ssi hopes that will soon become more people . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has grown mainly to where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly ever played a role , &quot; &quot; so Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; we are trying to make the people clear that even more behind their foods are . &quot;

human rights organization and blog are the newest goals of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
still un@@ lock the Egyptian authorities on the internet .
this time it hit the site of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ ni@@ sts .
&quot; on the weekend of the 05 August the Egyptian government documented the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ H@@ RI ) , which documents the human rights ab@@ uses in Egypt and the Arab world . &quot;
&quot; August published the network a statement on Facebook , where it cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information Management - in spite of this attack and the constitution by the authorities , which law really should defend his goal to overcome the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , so it was never as important as now . AN@@ H@@ RI has never been so important to overcome the block@@ age and do not nach@@ h@@ ad@@ mit . we cap@@ tiv@@ ated to fulfill our task . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ H@@ RI is considered the first cen@@ sored website of a human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities block more than two months of 21 pages , including the independent news side MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , arab@@ ic @-@ speaking issue of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and this from Qatar &apos;s network of Al J@@ az@@ e@@ era because of cultivated &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;

&quot; besides AN@@ H@@ RI also , there is no access to the blog of the colum@@ ni@@ sts and human rights play Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada , no access in Egypt . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada used his blog for the distribution of columns and articles , which he is not accessible for in Egypt , not accessible websites and media . &quot;
&quot; now the blog , which he was directed to circum@@ scri@@ bed the ig@@ nition apparatus of the Egyptian government , the goal of an attack . &quot;
&quot; B@@ log@@ ger who is also native to the supplier with the Zi@@ adas blog , on the other hand , is further accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo @-@ class , spent nearly 500 days in cap@@ tivity , after he reported in December 2013 by Egyptian security forces , while he reported on the Student@@ en@@ prot@@ este and recorded a video like the police of bodi@@ ly violence against two students . &quot;
his articles are mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada expressed to the semen through the government and reflected what this means for him : &quot;
&quot; the blogs to lock blogs is very old , but in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi priority ; and even if the block@@ age of blogs may not be significant for the world , so it is for two reasons for me : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It has succeeded to convey to me the feeling of an ins@@ ist condition ; a dep@@ ended murder , un@@ loading of the national Security Council , the block@@ age blogs as well as any other website , for which I worked . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) You have proved that I wrote not in vain . in other words , my words have influence , if only on a small audience . &quot;
I &apos;d like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
&quot; first , I used it to the post of articles to handle the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship . &quot;
&quot; however , after they have blocked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the mu@@ st@@ ling walk the way to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ eme and Ex@@ pression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities in the networks of various Internet Service Provider ( ISP ) , e.g. Orange , Vo@@ da@@ fone and E@@ tis@@ al@@ at . &quot;
&quot; AF@@ TE documented also the blo@@ cking of vendors , through the relocation of inter@@ net@@ en@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and private surfing possible , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ PN@@ s ) &quot;
AF@@ TE reported in her research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12 we noticed how the block@@ age of web pages , the V@@ PN@@ G began , began . &quot;
such a practice indicates the intention of the government continues to block and filter on the Egyptian users have access .
&quot; the situation will in addition be wel@@ wor@@ ated that the customs decisions have been taken behind closed doors , thus the Egyptian population has no legal basis that they cannot proceed against this actions . &quot;
&quot; now , the question : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and whom will it be next attack ? &quot;
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants are dispute .

&quot; day for Day reports in Brazil with d@@ row@@ ed headlines from Rio de Janeiro , the second @-@ largest city of the country and home of numerous post@@ cards . &quot;
some of these headlines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old in school , &quot; &quot; Je@@ im second day is mur@@ dered a police office in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; Di@@ iev@@ es pharmacy with military weapons from , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Marine and Lu@@ str@@ af@@ ee to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the Viol@@ ence of 2017 reached in Rio has been the highest stand for 10 years . &quot;
&quot; the Brazilian governmental organisation Global Justice calls for even the United Nations , to access the United Nations . &quot;
reports like these are all daily and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; thus published for detailed reporting about violence in Rio known newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; on 16 August the editorial &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; where she announced a new section called &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the motives for their decision explained the newspaper as follows :
&quot; extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder , smoke , sex break , etc . everything , however , from civil@@ ised standard , and what only happened in Rio is done in the &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way , to call : this is not normal ! &quot;
&quot; this is the only alternative , so that we as journalists are not able to ex@@ clude our eyes from the cru@@ el@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; in a vibr@@ ational video , which was shared on Facebook , explained Oc@@ t@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the Editor @-@ in @-@ Chief of the newspaper that this decision was no occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that does not recognise the war .
&quot; in the same video a journalist of the newspaper explains , that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro , there are 8@@ 43 areas that are controlled by criminal organisations . &quot;
in the editorial article the newspaper writes down :
&quot; us aware that a war dis@@ course , if he is distor@@ ted to also be used , Gr@@ aus@@ am@@ ities of the police , which could only be wrong , and then ask questions to be tu@@ cked . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose objective is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Maf@@ ia and its partners . &quot;
would the name &quot; war &quot; more than they benefit ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Bra@@ sil ar@@ gu@@ ed the journalist Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , against the violence as &quot; war &quot; . &quot; this was in their opinion a justi@@ fication of the failed security policy through the media and could be sc@@ ared to account responsible for the police . &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and bad planning - how extra in the analysis of military units in Rio itself has shown - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , education , and a historical and self @-@ od@@ or@@ able negl@@ ect of the public service . &quot;
&quot; to remember , the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than just its capital . &quot;

&quot; besides legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war draws the serious consequences for the people . &quot;
&quot; because this demands the state on the means and ways to use the typical of a war . this belongs the penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a civil war is an unusual point in the countryside and to the object for &quot; coll@@ ater@@ ies damage &quot; and &quot; ver@@ ir@@ r@@ te balls &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the following civil war many Syrian towns suffer from brut@@ al si@@ ege and block@@ ades , mainly through the Assad regime towards loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to victory , a common initiative of Peace Organization pax and the Forschungs@@ institut The Syria Institute , are in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , D@@ ei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ lib are currently around one million Syrian in a state of si@@ ege . &quot;
&quot; especially heavily affects the region East Gh@@ out@@ a , where an attack with chemical weapons on the 21st of August 2013 called for the lives of hundreds of civilians . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition go out , based on investigation of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the mass@@ ac@@ re of Assad has been practiced by Assad &apos;s regime . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these kinds of reb@@ els were standing outside of Damascus under si@@ ege , which led that inhabitants are dependent on local or through tunnel and control points . &quot;
&quot; due to the years of long block@@ ade , traditional foods has become un@@ att@@ ain@@ able for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; he teaches a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pl@@ ers and academ@@ ics , the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , as they can create their own mushrooms as &quot; &quot; life &quot; &quot; food source &quot; . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da and lead the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; mushrooms do not belong to the conventional , in Syria planted food and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . however , it makes it an attractive food source for many inhabitants of the bel@@ ag@@ ated East Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the title of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French News Agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we decided for the cultivation of mushrooms , because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because one can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ahmed L@@ eil@@ a , one of the organis@@ ers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years now , this project is well @-@ known and oppressed its relief that it is now more and more &quot; &quot; popularity . &quot; &quot;
to collect money for the initiative to collect n@@ ut@@ t in consultation with the NGO Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do .
&quot; it is planned to convey 125 families knowledge to pl@@ anting pil@@ es , such as L@@ eil@@ a to Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected aim of around 12.@@ 700 , but will continue to collect donations at Can@@ Do . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is dependent on generators , which hold temperature stable at 25 Â° C and the humidity at 80 % . &quot;
&quot; because of the Fuel of fuel , locally made fuel from plastic is used to supply the generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. L@@ eil@@ a said to Global Vo@@ ices , that they began with the &quot; production of &quot; from the regions base &quot; , &quot; before they are over@@ tested their quality and whether they are suitable for ze@@ al . &quot;
&quot; then they planted a small mushroom in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on . &quot;
&quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; curriculum for the region . &quot; &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the project and after further 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms anywhere in the east of Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot;
Dr. L@@ eil@@ a stated that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to bring people the mushroom from various reasons &quot; : Bru@@ ch of Bel@@ ag@@ ation . &quot;
providing a new food source on the market .
&quot; dis@@ semination of a culture of self @-@ catering , by eating ey@@ reste ( like paper , tea , coffee @-@ ware , cart@@ on , etc ) for the extraction of new foods . &quot;
&quot; creation of new jobs , especially for women who work at home . &quot;
creation of new jobs for people with disabilities who are tied to their home .
&quot; he said , &quot; we hope to spread this idea around the world so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and the si@@ ege are visible . &quot;

Portuguese is calling for justice for the victims of the associations of 2017
&quot; several hundreds of people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many District cities in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires , which in the week before that in the north of Portugal . &quot;
two @-@ two people died and around 70 were wo@@ unded as a result of wild@@ fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the government the last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days a state of State .
fr@@ actions were also registered in the Gal@@ zi@@ en region where there were 4 t@@ aves .
&quot; it appreci@@ ates that there were over 500 fire@@ bur@@ sts who spread out in the northern and central regions of the country , and about 250 million acres of woods and numerous villages . &quot;
&quot; in June , it was a similar tragedy in Pedr@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande a similar tragedy , where the br@@ aces have 64 deaths as well as over 200 ver@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; according to the European for@@ wards system , which monitors the forest areas by satellite recordings , are burned solely in Portugal approximately 500,000 acres of forest alone - an area of the size of the district Lisbon . &quot;
so that you can make a better picture of the Ernst of the situation : there is no fire only in 4 districts .
&quot; in all Portugal , we bur@@ ns in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a &apos; ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) 15 October , 2017 &quot;

numerous videos spread on the web and show images to better insights into the following :
the fore@@ se@@ eable tragedy
the aim of the protests from Saturday was the call for better preference and fire measures against the state .
the people ques@@ tioned why civil protection was not able to im@@ part@@ ed the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
JoÃ£o So@@ ver@@ al from the Bund der farmers declared the P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o newspaper :
&quot; after Pedr@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o , streets and villages were ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated for everything and nothing . &quot;
&quot; this Sunday they did so nowhere : there are stup@@ id reports of open roads , which were enclosed by fire . &quot;
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy could happen again as in June , as the roads were closed very late . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , contractor will be ques@@ tioned in est@@ abilities with high fire risk . &quot;
&quot; a wide proposal for the whale @-@ shape , which had brought the government after serious bre@@ aches in the years 2003 and 2005 , was issued by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment . &quot;
&quot; the government led a de@@ pl@@ ess of the law , which permitted the components of the case if the applic@@ ant of a means for self @-@ protection available - that was an open back@@ door , so that everything could be built , JoÃ£o Sor@@ val leads to the same article of the P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o newspaper . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organization cross @-@ cus was attentive to that large areas with eu@@ c@@ aly@@ pt@@ us , trees made from slightly burning wood , like in a Dev@@ ils circle , according to the walls of this sort . &quot;
&quot; in addition to these problems , the website of civil protection of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , were examined as inhabitants or tried to contact , relatives were offline . &quot;
it was a private initiative that provide the population with information sent : they used the own civil data using the application fo@@ gos@@ .@@ pt and inform@@ ing the population in real time about the location and the spread of fires .
&quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developers JoÃ£o P@@ ina to simplify the work of fire@@ bri@@ g@@ le and was at this fat@@ eful weekend in October so decisive that the servers per@@ mitting the 400@@ ,000 users who pursued the fires , not with@@ held the website more than half a million . &quot;

in a night in autumn 1994 the conquest of Afghanistan began through the Taliban .
&quot; two years ago , a fright@@ ful civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ jah@@ ed@@ in group@@ ings which had defe@@ ated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus , Afghanistan became a land of terror and desp@@ air . &quot;
&quot; exactly at this time in A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year boy , which belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central @-@ gh@@ an@@ istan for the last time with his family at dinner . &quot;
&quot; even though his mother said it at that time , she knew that she would not see her son a long time - maybe even more . &quot;
in the dawn the boy should break up .
his un@@ cle would bring him and bring him into the locks .

&quot; Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of Haz@@ ara domin@@ ates the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ W@@ ah@@ dat was just mur@@ dered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara felt un@@ balanced . &quot;
the Taliban gathered for their hat@@ red on the ha@@ ara of the Taliban .
many Haz@@ ara settled the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape A@@ shar@@ af found himself again in Pakistan .
he worked for a couple of years he worked in a cohesion . the work was heavy and made it sick .
&quot; then he took what was left from his low reward , and went to Iran . once again , he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and to@@ w sacks with mort@@ ar , the harder than he himself to make himself his living . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the life af@@ gh@@ ten refugees in Iran was characterised by mis@@ ery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , re@@ minded of A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we lived in an empty building on the building site , on which we also worked . &quot;
&quot; there was no services there and no heating . we suspended n@@ ylon in front of the open windows , so that we are not frozen at night . &quot;
after four years A@@ shar@@ af left his life without pe@@ eling in Iran and made ready for the journey to Europe .
&quot; with the dangerous over@@ ride on the sea it suffered wre@@ ck , and str@@ and@@ ete on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities had rejected its asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy . &quot;
&quot; some time was A@@ shar@@ af @-@ homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that passed twice a day to eat . &quot;
&quot; it is true that Italy due to relatively high resolution quot@@ as is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seek@@ ers . it is true also that the conditions , the asylum seek@@ ers in the country will be cat@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot;
&quot; the Human Rights Organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system suff@@ ers suffering from a general lack of transparency . &quot;
&quot; the great majority of asylum seek@@ ers is housed in the more than 3000 &quot; special recording centres . &quot; this is impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
&quot; according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be assigned to a reception center when they have officially asked a request for asylum , which is still working after the registration of the asylum application . &quot;
&quot; until then people are people who have no money for an accommodation , either on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street . &quot;
so it also erg@@ ing it also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his im@@ pris@@ oned lifestyle helped A@@ shar@@ af to deliver him soon out of these conditions .
&quot; after having made several years of working in construction , A@@ shar@@ af made his entire savings in the establishment of a youth hostels in Venice . &quot;
this ran so well that he had still opened a second hostel for a while .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now subject to the documentation &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director A@@ min Wa@@ hi@@ di .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to un@@ official estimates , approximately 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
for many of them the country is an attack on its way to other European countries .
&quot; in recent years some of Afghanistan was created , including tail@@ oring , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even pra@@ ised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice Ham@@ ed Ah@@ m@@ adi had the idea to his restaurant Orient Experience , in which the wa@@ it@@ ers and the kitchen staff mostly consist of refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the menu of the restaurant tells us through the various Afgh@@ an , Ira@@ qi , Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their trip to Italy . &quot;
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Kh@@ an Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ ul@@ og@@ na in Bologna and a Sus@@ hi Restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af@@ s destinations rich however far beyond Italian food industry and retailers and aims back to the country that he had to leave as a teen@@ ager as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where a risk is , are also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happy if I know that my people suffer .
&quot; I have a project for farmers from the poorest countries of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and have to get the same ways as all others .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ k will also for@@ ge plans for opening a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; &quot; so they can sell their seri@@ ousness on the market and improve their financial situation . &quot;
&quot; the development of the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but at the end stand stability and prosperity . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey itself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .

global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ tizen report is an international snapshot report that shows the challenges posed by vict@@ ories and upcoming trends in worldwide internet rights
&quot; the Egyptian Parliament check out a legislative process , which considers that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration at a government authority . &quot;
users would have to be able to use social networks within six months after the acceptance of the authority under specification of their full name and number .
who dre@@ amed this step could be sentenced to six months of liability or be condem@@ ned by the dec@@ eption of a criminal off@@ ense .
&quot; the law , which was advertis@@ ed by six@@ ty parliamentary members , is currently the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament , and shall be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; May , another member of the representative proposed a law proposal to be introduced in the harder pen@@ alties for the ins@@ ult of the President or of a high officials . &quot;
&quot; under Egyptian law is the ass@@ ass@@ ination of the president as well as state institutions to be pun@@ ish@@ able . however , under the law of law , such an effect would be har@@ v@@ ested with j@@ ailer and bank@@ du@@ es , so right @-@ wing of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East policy . &quot;
&quot; should the law be passed , this can mean up to three years in cu@@ sto@@ dy for the contrac@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would be a political climate , in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of freedom has already been in danger for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer of Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ id ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) which was arrested on 13 August 2013 , while demonstr@@ ating violence against demonstr@@ ators who have fought against the Military Tribunal of the elected President Mo@@ h@@ ammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan wa@@ ited , as much more than 700 protests had been arrested at the same inci@@ dent , four years in j@@ ail to a Angel . &quot;
&quot; recently his trial was postpon@@ ed on 20 May , because the pris@@ ings of human rights groups took to bring the acc@@ used of prison in court . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups are united , hy@@ po@@ uring of among other arms , illegal gathering , murder and un@@ ques@@ tion@@ able murder . &quot;
in another case a criminal tribun@@ al spoke in G@@ iza the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indi@@ cted for their coverage to pro @-@ Mor@@ si sitting block on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ Ada@@ wi@@ ya Square in Cairo .
&quot; the Court reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalists Ab@@ dul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly that were also arrested in the previously mentioned inci@@ dent , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
Tunis@@ ian acti@@ vi@@ sts to per@@ he@@ ed documents
&quot; May the Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with the trial of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , which is co @-@ founder of the independent media play@@ site Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy project . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia has been adher@@ ed to an established action plan . bes@@ ieg@@ ed plan comes from the President of the Republic , which , according to the Plan explicitly supports a contro@@ versi@@ al of law , the business@@ men , and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali corruption . &quot;
&quot; the document published on 21 April on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at , casts a light on how the preventive plans to support the law@@ suit . &quot;
Ben G@@ har@@ bia sur@@ ged the nam@@ ing of its sources under specification of Article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian freedom of press that journalists have the right to protect their sources .
&quot; nevertheless , he entered the district court in Tunis on 09 . May as a witness in the case . &quot;
will China force the users of social media to set their responsibilities here ?
&quot; according to new regulations of the information office of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media require a permit before they write messages in social media or share them . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the registration is also stated that the registration will be required by the full name of the names . &quot;
an@@ alysts agree that this is to be achieved by the elimination of anonymous comments in sub @-@ attitudes within social networks . it is now un@@ clear how the authorities apply these rules .
Chinese networks have proposed in social media to en@@ force these provisions only sel@@ ective to protect citizens journ@@ alism and its independence .
do we see ourselves in &quot; We@@ chat &quot; ?

&quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or fo@@ amed We@@ Chat , to register in the provincial government as &quot; &quot; organizer of the information spread &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this term is part of a law dating from 2014 , thanks to the Russian government takes a list of online services , which will also arrange the &quot; publication of information &quot; . &quot; the law allows the transfer of content to be held responsible for the removal of content , and force it on request for the removal of user data . &quot;
